HP:0002172|A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps.

HP:0002476|The primitive reflexes are a group of behavioural motor responses which are found in normal early development, are subsequently inhibited, but may be released from inhibition by cerebral, usually frontal, damage. They are thus part of a broader group of reflexes which reflect release phenomena, such as exaggerated stretch reflexes and extensor plantars. They do however involve more complex motor responses than such simple stretch reflexes, and are often a normal feature in the neonate or infant.

HP:0002623|An overriding aorta is a congenital heart defect where the aorta is positioned directly over a ventricular septal defect, instead of over the left ventricle. The result is that the aorta receives some blood from the right ventricle, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is one of the four conditions of the Tetralogy of Fallot. The aortic root can be displaced toward the front (anteriorly) or directly above the septal defect, but it is always abnormally located to the right of the root of the pulmonary artery. The degree of override is quite variable, with 5-95% of the valve being connected to the right ventricle.

HP:0002635|In type IV atherosclerotic lesions a dense accumulation of extracellular lipid occupies an extensive but well-defined region of the intima. This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. The nature and derivations of the lipid that constitutes the core are discussed in the section on the extracellular matrix at the end of this report. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion.

HP:0002638|Inflammation of a superficial vein associated with venous thrombosis (blood clot formation within the vein).
HP:0002639|Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the right atrium, 1 and occurs in 1/100,000 of the general population worldwide. The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.

It is a descriptive term, not a specific diagnosis or disorder (as such, it is a syndrome). Affected babies are born in a collodion membrane, a shiny waxy outer layer to the skin. This is shed 10-14 days after birth, revealing the main symptom of the disease, extensive scaling of the skin caused by hyperkeratosis. With increasing age, the scaling tends to be concentrated around joints in areas such as the groin, the armpits, the inside of the elbow and the neck. The scales often tile the skin and may resemble fish scales.

HP:0008629|Pulsatile tinnitus is generally classified a kind of objective tinnitus, meaning that it is not only audible to the patient but also to the examiner on auscultation of the auditory canal and/or of surrounding structures with use of an auscultation tube or stethoscope. Usually, pulsatile tinnitus is heard as a lower pitched thumping or booming, a rougher blowing sound which is coincidental with respiration, or as a clicking, higher pitched rhythmic sensation. Pulsatile tinnitus may be associated with vascular abnormalities such as arterioevenous shunts or glomus tumors or the jugular vein, arterial bruits related to a high-riding carotid artery (close to the auditory areas) or carotid stenosis, or venous abnormalities such as a dehiscent jugular bulb or to hypertension. Finally, in some patients, mechanical abnormalities such a spatulous eustachian tubes, palatomyoclonus (small spasms of muscles in the soft palate area), or idiopathic stapedial muscle spasm may represent the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus.

HP:0030665|Rubral tremor is characterized by a slow coarse tremor at rest that is exacerbated by postural adjustments and by guided voluntary movements.
HP:0030666|In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.

During the third week of human embryogenesis, the neurenteric canal unites the yolk sac and the amniotic cavity as it traverses the primitive notochordal plate. Persistence of the normally transient neurenteric canal prevents appropriate separation of endoderm and notochord. This results in a variable degree of communication between neural and enteric epithelium.

HP:0030733|An abdominal wall defected related to a developmental anomaly of the allantois, which is an embryonic structure that develops as a diverticulum off the yolk sac at about 16 days post fertilization. During further development, the allantois becomes incorporated into the body of the embryo, connecting the ventral aspect of the urogenital sinus (which will develop into the upper pole of the urinary bladder) to the external portion of the umbilicus. Upon further development, the lumen of the allantois becomes obliterated and forms a thick fibrous cord called the urachus, which connects the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus. In adults, the urachus is known as the median umbilical ligament. Failure of the allantoic cavity to obliterate can result of one of four conditions: 1) congenital patent urachus (a completely open connection between bladder and umbilicus); 2) vesicourachal diverticulum (a diverticulum off the bladder but not communicating with the umbilicus); umbilical cyst and sinus (not communicating with the bladder); and 4) alternating urachal sinus. An abdominal wall defect can be associated with a urachal cyst.

HP:0030754|A swelling formed at the base of umbilicus associated with a patent urachus which results from an allantoic remnant. The urachus is a fibrous remnant of the allantois which communicates from the apex of the urinary bladder to the umbilicus. Failed obliteration of the urachus can lead to various abnormalities: urachal cyst, urachal diverticulum, sinus or patent urachus - the most common type. Allantoic cysts in infants with patent urachus can be formed due to the drainage of urine into the umbilical cord, or in uncommon situations, after leakage of hypo-osmotic urine into the Wharton's jelly.

HP:0030780|An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

HP:0030847|An anomaly of the jugular venous pressure. The internal jugular veins, being continuous with the superior vena cava, provide a visible measure of the degree to which the systemic venous reservoir is filled. The vertical height above the right atrium to which they are distended and above which they are in a collapsed state provides an imperfect reflection of the right atrial pressure.
HP:0030848|Increased jugular venous pressure.

Normally there is either no rise or only a transient (i.e., 2 to 3 sec) rise in mean jugular venous pressure. A sustained increase in the mean venous pressure until abdominal compression is released is abnormal and indicates impaired right heart function. This abnormal response is called hepatojugular reflux.

HP:0030883|Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) results from one or more bony abnormalities that lead to abnormal contact between the acetabulum and the femoral head or neck. The femoral abnormality is proposed to cause compression and shear stresses in the region between the labrum and cartilage, anterosuperiorly. These stresses cause a separation between the labrum and cartilage as the labrum is pushed outwards and the cartilage is pushed centrally. This eventually leads to articular degeneration and eventually global hip osteoarthritis.

HP:0030903|A type of primitive reflex that can be elicated when the hand of the examiner is gently inserted into the palm of the patient's hand. The palmar surface is stroked or simply touched. The flexor surfaces of the fingers may be stimulated also by the examiner's fingers. The stimulus should be in a distal direction. With a positive response, the patient grasps the examiner's hand with variable strength and continues to grasp as the examiner's hand is moved. Ability to release the grip voluntarily depends on the activity of the reflex; some patients can do so readily, while others can even be lifted off the bed, since the grasp has such power [NCBI Books:NBK395].

HP:0031570|A Number 0 Tessier cleft is a true median cleft lip with a broad columella and bifid nasal tip. The alveolar cleft is between the central incisors. The nasal septum may be thickened, duplicated, or absent. The nasal bridge is usually broad with associated orbital hypertelorism. The midline soft tissue anomaly may range from a mild broadening of the philtrum or there may be a true median cleft lip. The columella and nasal tip are typically bifid and broadened with a midline depression. The alae nasi are intact but laterally displaced. The nose appears shortened in the vertical dimension.
HP:0031571|A type of facial cleftlocated near to but not directly on the midline of the face.
HP:0031572|As seen in a typical cleft lip, a cleft of the lip is found in the region of the cupid's bow. The nostril is cleft through the alar dome and extends above onto the nasal dorsum. It passes medial to a normal, but dys- topic, medial canthus. There is an alveolar cleft between the central and lateral incisors that extends above through the pyriform margin lateral to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is not involved. The bony cleft extends through the nasal bone or between the junction of the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. Above the cleft lip, the clefting of the alar dome is associated with deviation to the opposite side of the shortened and broadened columella and nasal tip. Extension of the soft tissue cleft onto the nasal dorsum can be manifest as a series of vertical soft tissue furrows and ridges. Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions. There is a keel-shaped alveolus and anterior open bite. Normal septation is preserved between the nasal cavity and the hypoplastic maxillary antrum on the affected side. Distortion of the nasal skeleton produces gross flattening of the nasal dorsum. There is asymmetry of the pterygoid plates, of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid, and of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. The distortion of the cranial base may result in a mild plagiocephaly.
HP:0031573|As is typically seen in isolated cleft cases, a cleft of the lip is present. There is hypoplasia, but not true notching of the ala nasi with flattening of the lateral part of the nose. The nasal root is broadened, with lateral displacement of the inner canthus. The palpebral fissure and lacrimal drainage system are not disturbed. The alveolar cleft is through the lateral incisor area and extends to the pyriform aperture. There is normal septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Notching at the junction between the nasal bone is present, as is a broad, flat frontal process of the maxilla. Transverse ethmoid enlargement produces orbital hypertelorism. Above the cleft of the lip and palate is a true broad cleft of the nostril that is medial to the intact, but laterally displaced, tail of the alar cartilage. A shallow soft tissue groove extends superiorly to the asymmetrically widened nasal root. The lacrimal system, palpebral fissures, and eyebrows remain intact. The alveolar cleft extends posteriorly as a complete unilateral cleft of the hard and soft palate. The nasal septum is intact but deviated to the opposite side. The nasal cavity remains separated from the normally pneumatized, although hypoplastic, maxilla on the cleft side. Above the nasomaxillary notching, the ethmoid sinus is less well developed, and there is no pneumatization of the frontal sinus on this side. Anterior rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid occurs on the cleft side in relation to the narrower orbit and smaller ethmoid sinus. There is mild asymmetry of the anterior cranial fossa, which is narrower on the cleft side. The cranium is brachycephalic with marked occipital flattening.
HP:0031574|A facial cleft characterized by involvment of the orbit.
HP:0031575|As in the Number 1 and Number 2 clefts, this cleft extends through the lip in the region of the typical cleft lip; however, it does not extend through the base. The cleft continues superiorly to involve the inner canthus and lower eyelid medial to the inferior lacrimal punctum, thereby disrupting the nasolacrimal system. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side. The pterygoid process appears anatomically normal, but less displaced from the midline compared with that of the noncleft side. Both the orbit and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa are inferiorly displaced.
HP:0031576|The cleft lip is midway between the philtral ridge and the commissure of the mouth. The cleft is lateral to the normally shaped and placed nasal ala and passes onto the cheek. The cleft extends through the lower eyelid lateral to the punctum. The lacrimal system and inner canthus are normal. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The orbital floor cleft has no communication with the inferior orbital fissure. The cleft does not extend to the skull base, but there is marked facial asymmetry associated with plagiocephaly.
HP:0031577|The cleft of the lip is just medial to the oral commissure and extends across the cheek as a furrow. It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium.
HP:0031578|A facial cleft extending from the zygomatic arch to the eye. This zygomaticomaxillary cleft is similar to that typically found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The overlying tissue shows a vertical sclerodermic furrow radiating from the labial commissure or the angle of the mandible across the cheek to a coloboma of the lower eyelid between the middle and lateral one-third. Microphthalmia is not observed. The skeletal cleft is between the maxilla and zygoma; it passes through the inferolateral orbital rim to enter the inferior orbital fissure. No alveolar cleft is present. The zygomatic arch is intact. The soft tissue furrow, which is more apparent on the right, radiates from the oral commissure toward the lateral two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The antimongoloid obliquity of the palpebral fissures is associated with laterally placed lower eyelid clefts and some ectropion. Aleft-sided anophthalmia is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue hypoplasia and is reflected in a short palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and minor ptosis of the eyebrow. No abnormality is present in the alveolar arch except for some tilting of the occlusal plane secondary to hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla. There is a vertical bony groove in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture that ends in the inferolateral portion of a small bony orbit. More laterally, the remainder of the zygomatic body and arch is normal in both shape and dimension. The lateral orbital floor is downslanting but intact, and it lacks direct communication with the temporal or infratemporal fossae. The hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla and orbit is associated with a reduction in the transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the anterior cranial fossa; mild asymmetry of the middle cranial fossa and calvarium is present. No significant asymmetry of size, shape, or position is present in the sphenoid.
HP:0031579|The temporozygomatic Number 7 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia. Soft tissue manifestations include macrostomia, malformations of the external and middle ear, temporalis muscle, variable involvement of the seventh cranial nerve (in hemifacial microsomia), and abnormalities of the preauricular hair in Treacher Collins syndrome. The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric. There is no antegonial notching of the mandible. Marked cranial base asymmetry, with tilting and asymmetric positioning of the temporomandibular articulations, is present. The anatomy of the sphenoid is abnormal, especially on the right where there is no recognizable medial or lateral pterygoid plate.
HP:0031580|The frontozygomatic or Number 8 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and the Goldenhar variant of hemifacial microsomia. Skeletal defects are more prominent in Treacher Collins syndrome, whereas the soft tissue clefting is more typical in cases of ''Goldenhar syndrome''. Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The symmetry of the facial anomalies is reflected in the apparently normal symmetric anterior and middle cranial fossae.
HP:0031581|This is an upper lateral orbital cleft. The soft tissue deformity is in the lateral one-third of the upper eyelid, and the bony cleft is through the superolateral orbital angle. Microphthalmia is present. The superolateral bony deficiency of the orbits allows a lateral displacement of the globes. The lateral one-third of the upper eyelid and the outer canthus are distorted, thus preventing apposition to the globe. The upper eyelid does not have a true cleft. A soft tissue furrow radiates superiorly and posterisphenoid is symmetric and normal. Mild cranial base asymmetry is reflected in the pterygoid plates. The left pair is more laterally displaced from the midline. Skull vault plagiocephaly is evident with an apparent reduction in the anteroposterior dimension of the anterior cranial fossa.
HP:0031582|In a Number 10 Tessier cleft there is an upper central orbital cleft with a cleft of the middle one-third of the upper eyelid, which often results in total ablepharia. The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated. Similar distortion of the anterior cranial fossa is evident, being broader and more flattened on the affected side. The calvarium above the level of the cleft and the cranial base below is symmetric.
HP:0031583|An upper medial orbital cleft produces a cleft of the medial one-third of the upper eyelid that extends through the eyebrow into the frontal hairline. The skeletal element of the cleft in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla may either pass lateral to the ethmoid, through the supraorbital rim, or it may pass through the ethmoidal labyrinth to produce orbital hypertelorism. This cleft usually accompanies the Number 3 cleft. The soft tissue features include a cleft of the medial portion of the upper eyelid, an irregularity in hair orientation at the medial end of the eyebrow, and a long tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline onto the forehead. There is a mild flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla and extensive pneumatization of both the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses, both of which are more prominent on the cleft side. No bony clefting of the supraorbital rim or frontal bone is evident. The cranial base and sphenoid architecture, including the pterygoid processes, are symmetric and normal.
HP:0031584|There is a soft tissue cleft medial to the inner canthus with a cleft of the root of the eyebrow. The frontal process of the maxilla is flat and broadened, and the ethmoid labyrinth is increased in tranverse dimension, thereby producing orbital hypertelorism. The cribriform plate is of normal width. The frontal sinus is enlarged. Even though the frontal bone is flattened, bony clefts with encephalocele have not been observed. There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse. The extensive pneumatization of the sinuses on the cleft side extends backward through the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and into the sphenoid sinus. The anatomy of the sphenoid, including the pterygoid processes, is otherwise normal. The anterior and middle cranial fossae floors are both broadened on the cleft side with minor widening of the cribriform plate.
HP:0031585|There is a paramedian frontal encephalocele and a soft tissue cleft that passes medial to an intact eyebrow. The frontal bone shows a paramedian bony cleft with an associated encephalocele. The olfactory groove, cribriform plate, and ethmoid sinus are all increased in transverse diameter, resulting in hypertelorism. The cleft extends medially to the undisturbed eyebrow to end in a short paramedian frontal widow's peak. The bony cleft begins in the region of the nasal bone and extends superiorly through the full height of the frontal bone. Posteriorly, the cleft extends through the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus as far as the lesser wing and body of the sphenoid. The pterygoid processes are anatomically normal, but they are displaced laterally from the midline on the cleft side. There is orbital hypertelorism below and asymmetry of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa above.
HP:0031586|This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa. The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is upslanting from its medial aspect to its lateral aspect, with a harlequin appearance on the coronal scan.
HP:0031587|A lower midline facial cleft, also known as the median mandibular cleft. It is a rare anomaly, which may be limited to a defect in the soft tissue of the lower lip. However, in the more severe form, it may extend into the bony mandibular symphysis.

HP:0031602|An anomaly in the system of mucociliary transport, which functions to transport the mucous layer lining the respiratory epithelium by ciliary \nbeating.
HP:0031603|An abnormally increased amount of time required to clear mucus (and substances contained in the mucus) from the nasal mucosa. The nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) system functions to transport the mucous layer lining the nasal epithelium towards the naso pharynx by ciliary beating in a metachronous fashion at a frequency of 7-16 Hz. NMC depends upon two principal components: physicochemical qualities and quantities of mucus and the properties of cilia that propel it. NMC is considered to be representative of pulmonary clearance. normal NMC time is determined to be up to 20 minutes. Duration of 30 minutes is considered as the cutoff point that discriminates normal subjects from subjects with impaired NMC. NMC can be measured by determination of the transport time of markers that are placed on the nasal mucosa including saccharine, radioactive markers, and dyes.

HP:0031663|Normally, the aortic valve closure (A2) is followed by the pulmonic valve closure (P2) but the A2-P2 interval increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration. With paradoxical splitting, there is a delay in the closure of the aortic valve, so that A2 can follow P2; the individual components can be appreciated at the end of expiration and the interval narrows with inspiration (which is the oposite of the normal pattern).

HP:0031671|Typical atrial flutter is an organised atrial tachycardia. It can also be defined as a macroreentrant tachycardia confined to the right atrium. This arrhythmia has a 200-260 ms cycle length, although it may fluctuate depending on patient's previous treatment or ablation, congenital heart disease, etc. Ventricular rate response will be limited by the atrioventricular node conductions, usually presenting a 2:1 or 3:1 response, during atrial flutter. Typical (counter clockwise) flutter is associated with the common flutter pattern: a regular continuous undulation with dominant negative deflections in inferior leads II, III and aVF, often described also as a saw tooth pattern, and flat atrial deflections in leads I and aVL. Atrial deflections in V1 can be positive, biphasic or negative.

HP:0031677|A type of ventricular tachycardia that is characterized by variable QRS complexes within each lead (i.e., QRS complexes may be different from beat to beat).
HP:0031678|A lesion associated with atherosclerosis, a multifactorial and multipart progressive disease manifested by the focal development within the arterial wall of lesions, that ranges from teh development of a fatty streak, plaque progression, and plaque disruption. Atherosclerotic lesions demonstrate consistent morphological characteristics, which indicate that each type may stabilize temporarily or permanently and that progression to the next type may require an additional stimulus.
HP:0031679|Type I lesions represent the very initial changes and are recognized as an increase in the number of intimal macrophages and the appearance of macrophages filled with lipid droplets (foam cells).
HP:0031680|Type II atherosclerotic lesions include the fatty streak lesion, the first grossly visible lesion, and are characterized by layers of macrophage foam cells and lipid droplets within intimal smooth muscle cells and minimal coarse-grained particles and heterogeneous droplets of extracellular lipid.
HP:0031681|Type III (intermediate) atherosclerotic lesions are the morphological and chemical bridge between type II and advanced lesions. Type III lesions appear in some adaptive intimal thickenings (progression-prone locations) in young adults and are characterized by pools of extracellular lipid in addition to all the components of type II lesions.
HP:0031682|Type V lesions are defined as lesions in which prominent new fibrous connective tissue has formed. When the new tissue is part of a lesion with a lipid core (type IV), this type of morphology may be referred to as fibroatheroma or type Va lesion. A type V lesion in which the lipid core and other parts of the lesion are calcified may be referred to as type Vb. A type V lesion in which a lipid core is absent and lipid in general is minimal may be referred to as type Vc. With these lesions, arteries are variously narrowed, generally more than with type IV. Importantly, as with type IV lesions, type V lesions may develop fissures, hematoma, and/or thrombus (type VI lesion), and for this reason too they are clinically relevant.
HP:0031683|Type VI atherosclerotic lesions generally have the underlying morphology of type IV or V lesions, surface disruptions, hematoma, and thrombosis may be (although less often) superimposed on any other type of lesion and even on intima without an apparent lesion. Complicating features may arise because of individual differences in risk factors and tissue reactions. These may include differences in composition of the blood, the relative quantities and distributions in the components of the underlying lesion or intima, as well as modifications of shear and tensile forces to which the lesion or intima is exposed. Clinical imaging of lesions may be expected to contribute greatly to the understanding of type VI lesions and the associated clinical syndromes.
