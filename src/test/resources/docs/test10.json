Both training interventions seemed to improve the primary outcome (stair climbing) in comparison to historical data on patients following standard post-operative care, although such comparisons should be performed cautiously.

The annual progression rate of atherosclerosis was the outcome of interest. In stage 2 we studied vascular inflammation using FDG PET/CT in PsA patients on TNFi (n=21) and age and sex matched PsA patients not on any biologics (n=13). This sample underwent FDG PET/CT scans at baseline and 1 year to assess vascular inflammation, measured as target-to-background ratio (TBR). In both studies, statistical analyses included multivariable regression analysis adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and statins.In the first stage, men had a significantly higher atherosclerosis progression compared to women (p<0.001). TNFi was associated with a reduced atherosclerosis progression (adjusted β=-2.20, 95% CI -3.41, -1.00, p<0.001) in men, after controlling for cardiovascular risk and statins. However, there was no association between TNFi and atherosclerosis progression in women (p=0.71). In the second stage, at 1 year, patients on TNFi had a reduction in TBR (p=0.03). However, those not on TNFi had no significant change in their TBR (p=0.32). The improvement in aortic vascular inflammation in the TNFi group was independent of cardiovascular risk factors (adjusted β= -0.41, 95% CI -0.74, -0.08, p=0.02).TNFi treatment was associated with reduced progression of carotid plaques in men and improvement in vascular inflammation in psoriatic patients.

The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic benefits of two FX006 doses with saline-placebo injection.In this Phase 2b study, participants with knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2-3) and average daily pain (ADP)-intensity ≥5 to ≤9 (0-10 Numeric Rating Scale) were randomized (1:1:1) and received single IA injections of FX006 32 mg (N=104) or 16 mg (N=102) or saline-placebo (N=100). The primary endpoint was least-squares-mean (LSM) change from baseline to Week 12 in weekly mean ADP-intensity scores for FX006 32 mg versus saline-placebo.The primary endpoint was not met (FX006 32 mg versus saline-placebo LSM-change at Week 12: -3.1 versus -2.5; LSM-difference [95% confidence interval] of -0.58 [-1.22, 0.07]; P = 0.08). However, FX006 32 mg improvements were significant versus saline-placebo at Weeks 1-11 and Week 13. FX006 16 mg improvements were significant versus saline-placebo at Weeks 1-9. A dose-response was evident in duration of maximal analgesic effect (32 mg: 13 weeks versus 16 mg: 9 weeks), with FX006 32 mg providing increased therapeutic benefit relative to FX006 16 mg. All treatments were well-tolerated.Although the primary endpoint was not met, FX006 demonstrated a prolonged reduction in symptoms with an evident dose response and a safety profile similar to that of saline-placebo.

He attributed the visual loss to potential injury during his work as a welder. In addition, he complained of several months of diffuse body pain and stiffness and generalized malaise. The pain and stiffness were worse in his shoulders and hips and were worse in the morning, with improvement by the middle of the day. On some days, these symptoms were so severe that he was unable to go to work. He also noted a vague bitemporal headache, worse on the left than the right. This article is protected by copyright.
