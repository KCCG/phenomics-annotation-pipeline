    "articleAbstract": "Influenza infections can cause a variety of different systemic problems beyond respiratory symptoms. A 4-year-old boy with a history of atopy, infected with influenza A, presented to our hospital with an asthma exacerbation developed symptoms of anaphylaxis. He was treated with a full course of oseltamivir and symptoms resolved without recurrence of allergic reaction. Infections have been implicated as causes of anaphylaxis but this has mostly been limited to parasites. While viral infections have been documented as causes of urticarial rashes, anaphylaxis due to viral infection has only been reported once, in an adult patient. There have not been any reports of anaphylaxis related to influenza infections. Early recognition and treatment of patients with influenza may prevent progression of systemic allergic reactions.

    "articleAbstract": "Implantable pacemakers stand as a mainstay in our therapeutic arsenal, affording those suffering from advanced cardiac conduction system disease both an improved quality of life and reduced mortality. Annually, over 225,000 new pacemakers are implanted in the United States for bradyarrhythmias and heart block. The first implantable transvenous pacemakers appeared in 1965; they were bulky devices, hobbled by a short battery life, and a single pacing mode. Modern transvenous pacemakers have evolved considerably with significant improvements in battery life, pacing options, and lead technology but are still subject to a spectrum of complications stemming from either the subcutaneous pocket or the leads, including: hematoma, infection, wound dehiscence, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, lead dislodgment, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, lead failure, venous obstruction, tricuspid valve insufficiency, and endocarditis. Single-chamber right ventricular (RV) leadless cardiac pacemakers, a concept from the past, has been revitalized to address these complications. Improvements in battery life, device miniaturization, catheter-based delivery tools, and advanced programming have made leadless cardiac pacemakers a viable option. In this review, we will discuss single-component leadless cardiac pacemaker technology, provide an overview of the two approved devices, and discuss their benefits as well as their limitations.

    "articleAbstract": "Rehabilitation is crucial in the treatment of ACL injuries, particularly in the pediatric population. Children are often eager to return to their pre-injury level of athletic participation, which may place them at risk for re-injury if rehabilitation protocols are not adequately followed. Contemporary protocols incorporate functional benchmarks rather than solely time-based milestones to better evaluate if patients have adequate strength and function to return to sport activities. Optimization of rehabilitation can lead to safer return to play and minimize the risk of re-injury. Ultimately, successful rehabilitation requires effective communication between the entire care team, including the patient, family, therapist, coaches, trainers, and orthopaedic surgeon in order to optimize recovery from injury.

    "articleAbstract": "Alcohol exposure during in utero development can permanently change the developmental programming of physiological responses, thereby increasing the risk of childhood neurological illnesses and later adverse health outcomes associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). There is an increasing body of evidence indicating that alcohol exposure during gestation triggers lasting epigenetic alterations in offspring long after the initial insult; together, these studies support the role of epigenetics in FASD etiology. However, we still have little information about how ethanol interferes with the fundamental epigenetic reprogramming wave (e.g., erasure and re-establishment of DNA methylation marks) that characterizes preimplantation embryo development. This article will review key epigenetic processes occurring during preimplantation development and especially focus on the current knowledge regarding how a prenatal alcohol exposure during this period could affect the developmental programming of the early stage preimplantation embryo. We will also outline current limitations of studies examining the in vivo and in vitro effects of alcohol exposure on embryos as well as underline the next critical steps to be taken if we want to better understand the implicated mechanisms in order to strengthen the translational potential for non-invasive epigenetic diagnosis markers and the treatment of newborns that have higher risks of developing FASD.",

    "articleAbstract": "Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

In the present study we investigated dairy cattle of all ages in northeast China for the prevalence and genetic traits of Cryptosporidium. Nested PCR of the small subunit rRNA gene was used to identify Cryptosporidium species or genotype. The parasite was detected in 130 of 537 (24.2%) animals sampled from the cities of Harbin (35.2%, 69/196) and Qiqihar (32.1%, 61/190). Cryptosporidium parvum (87/130) was identified as the dominant species by sequence analysis, followed by Cryptosporidium bovis (28/130), Cryptosporidium ryanae (5/130), Cryptosporidium andersoni (2/130), Cryptosporidium suis-like genotype (2/130), and mixed C. ryanae/C. bovis (1/130). Subtyping of Cryptosporidium parvum isolates was based on the DNA polymorphisms of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene. Subtyping of the C. parvum isolates recognized subtypes IIdA15G1 (24/87) in Harbin and IIdA20G1 (48/87) in Qiqihar. A diversity of Cryptosporidium species/genotype and subtypes was identified in cattle from northeast China. Widespread occurrence of human-pathogenic Cryptosporidium species and subtypes is of public health significance. This is the first study reporting C. parvum subtype IIdA20G1 in China. The findings improve the epidemiological knowledge of bovine cryptosporidiosis in China, highlighting the importance of ongoing Cryptosporidium surveillance.",

We have developed a new assay to identify Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (S. enterica) serovars based on a triplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with pyrosequencing for amplicon confirmation and phylogenetic discrimination of strain. The top 54 most prevalent serovars of S. enterica in Canada were examined with a total of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or variations (SNVs) located on three genes (fliD, sopE2, and spaO). Seven of the most common serovars, including Newport, Typhi, Javiana, Infantis, Thompson, Heidelberg and Enteritidis are successfully distinguished from the other serovars based on their unique SNP/SNV combinations. The remaining serovars, including Typhimurium, ssp I 4,[5],12:i:-, and Saintpaul are further divided into 47 subgroups that demonstrate the relatedness to phylogenetic classifications of each serovar. This pyrosequencing assay is not only cost-effective, rapid, and user-friendly, but also provides phylogenetic information by analysing 23 selected SNPs. With the additional layer of confidence to the PCR results and the accuracy and speed of pyrosequencing, this novel method would benefit the food industry and provides a tool for rapid outbreak investigation through quick detection and identification of common S. enterica serovars in Canada.",

    "articleAbstract": "The isomerizations of 3-aza-3-ium-dihydrobenzvalene, 3,4-diaza-3-ium-dihydrobenzvalene, and 3,4-diaza-diium-dihydrobenzvalene to their respective cyclic-diene products have been studied using electronic structure methods with a multiconfigurational wavefunction and several single reference methods. Transition states for both the allowed (conrotatory) and forbidden (disrotatory) pathways were located. The conrotatory pathways of each structure all proceed through a cyclic intermediate with a trans double bond in the ring: this trans double bond destroys the aromatic stabilization of the π electrons due to poor orbital overlap between the cis and trans π bonds. The 3, 4-diaza-3-ium-dihydrobenzvalene structure has C1 symmetry, and there are four separate allowed and forbidden pathways for this structure. The 3-aza-3-ium-dihydrobenzvalene structure is Cs symmetric, and there are two separate allowed and forbidden pathways for this structure. For 3, 4-diaza-3, 4-diium-benzvalene, there was a single allowed and single forbidden pathway due to the C2v symmetry. The separation of the barrier heights for all three molecules was studied, and we found the difference in activation barriers for the lowest allowed and lowest forbidden pathways in 3, 4-diaza-3-ium-dihydrobenzvalene, 3-aza-3-ium-dihydrobenzvalene, and 3, 4-diaza-diium-benzvalene to be 9.1, 7.4, and 3.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The allowed and forbidden barriers of 3, 4-diaza-diium-dihydrobenzvalene were separated by 3.7 kcal/mol, which is considerably less than the 12-15 kcal/mol expected based on the orbital symmetry rules. The addition of the secondary ammonium group tends to shift the conrotatory and disrotatory barriers up in energy (approximately 12-14 kcal/mol (conrotatory) and 5-10 kcal/mol (disrotatory) per secondary NH2 group) relative to the barriers of dihydrobenzvalene, but there is negligible effect on E, Z to Z, Z isomerization barriers, which remain in the expected range of > 4 kcal/mol.",

    "articleAbstract": "Detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) have unique physical and chemical properties that make them invaluable in many applications. However, DNDs are generally assumed to show weak fluorescence, if any, unless chemically modified with organic molecules. We demonstrate that detonation nanodiamonds exhibit significant and excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence from the visible to the near-infrared spectral region above 800 nm - even without the engraftment of organic molecules to their surfaces. We show that this fluorescence depends on the surface functionality of the DND particles. The investigated functionalized DNDs, produced from the same purified DND, are hydrogen, hydroxyl, carboxyl, ethylenediamine, octadecylamine terminated, as well as the as-received poly-functional starting material. All DNDs are investigated in-solution and on a silicon wafer substrate and compared to fluorescent high-pressure high-temperature nanodiamonds. The brightest fluorescence is observed from octadecylamine functionalized particles, which is more than 100 times brighter than the least fluorescent particles, carboxylated DNDs. The majority of photons emitted by all particle types likely originates from non-diamond carbon. However, we locally find bright and photostable fluorescence from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond in hydrogenated, hydroxylated and carboxylated detonation nanodiamonds. Our results contribute to understanding the effects of surface chemistry on the fluorescence of DNDs and enable the exploration of the fluorescent properties of DNDs for applications in theranostics, as non-toxic fluorescent labels, sensors, nanoscale tracers, and many others where chemically stable and brightly fluorescent nanoparticles with tailorable surface chemistry are needed.",

    "articleAbstract": "Most commonly magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles (MagPlas NPs) are unique composites combining magnetic and plasmonic materials within a confined nanoscale area that simultaneously show magnetic and plasmonic characteristics. They generally use Fe, Co, or Ni-based magnetic materials and noble-metal (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu, or Pt) plasmonic components, comprising a precious metal layer along a magnetic core or the inverse structure. MagPlas NPs are emerging multi-functional materials in the fields of nanoscale optoelectronics, anisotropic optics, electronics, optical sensing, and imaging. Their potential for sensing, targeting, and multimodal imaging is highly attractive for nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology. Because they possess suitable biocompatibility, MagPlas NPs have also been used in biosensor systems, hyperthermia, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. This relatively new field of science employs MagPlas NPs in biological systems, which have great application potential in biomedicine and biomedical technologies. In addition, many researchers study MagPlas nanomaterials because no other technology can precisely control the locations of nanoscale materials at designated positions, except for magnetic NPs using external magnetic fields. In order to easily produce metamaterial films and novel self-assembled structures, acute control via dynamic external magnetic forces has recently emerged with the assistance of substrate-particle interactions and van der Waals forces.",

    "articleAbstract": "We conducted combined gas-phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory studies on nucleobase-silver complexes. The most probable structures of the nucleobase-Ag- complexes were determined by comparing the theoretical calculations with the experimental measurements. The vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of uracil-Ag-, thymine-Ag-, cytosine-Ag- and guanine-Ag- were estimated to be 2.18 ± 0.08 eV, 2.11 ± 0.08 eV, 2.04 ± 0.08 eV and 2.20 ± 0.08 eV, respectively, based on their photoelectron spectra. Adenine-Ag- has two isomers coexisting in the experiment, the experimental vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of the two isomers are 2.18 and 2.53 eV, respectively. In the most probable isomers of nucleobases-Ag-, uracil, thymine and cytosine interact with Ag- anion via N-H···Ag and C-H···Ag hydrogen bonds, while adenine and guanine interact with Ag- anion through two N-H···Ag hydrogen bonds. The N-H···Ag hydrogen bonds can be characterized as medium or strong hydrogen bonds. It is found that binding sites of the Ag anion to the nucleobases are affected by the deprotonation energies (DPEs) and the steric effects of two adjacent X-H groups.",

Although the phase separation of the Lo and Lα phases on both a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) and a supported membrane remains stable for a long time, the lateral diffusion of lipids across each domain boundary occurs quickly. Since the phase separation and domain arrangement are governed by the stiffness and lateral tension of the lipid membrane, the phase separation is rearranged on a micropatterned substrate. Similar phase separation of the Lo and Lα phases is observed at a lipid membrane suspended over a microwell. However, the Lα phase is preferred at a suspended membrane, and saturated lipids and cholesterol are excluded towards the supporting membrane on the periphery. Since the Lo domain area is reduced by anisotropic diffusion through the boundary between the suspended and supported membranes, a very slow reduction rate with a linear functional relation is observed. Finally, a localized Lα phase domain is observed at a membrane suspended over a microwell, which is surrounded by an Lo phase supported membrane.",

    "articleAbstract": "We use correlated confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopy to probe the interplay between local variations in charge carrier recombination and charge carrier transport in methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite thin films. We find that local photoluminescence variations present in confocal imaging are also observed in widefield imaging, while intensity-dependent confocal measurements show that the heterogeneity in non-radiative losses observed at low excitation powers becomes less pronounced at higher excitation powers. Both confocal and widefield images show that carriers undergo anisotropic diffusion due to differences in inter-grain connectivity. These data are all qualitatively consistent with trap-dominated variations in local photoluminescence intensity, and with grain boundaries that exhibit varying degrees of opacity to carrier transport. We use a two-dimensional kinetic model to simulate and compare confocal time-resolved photoluminescence decay traces with experimental data. The simulations further support the assignment of local variations in non-radiative recombination as the primary cause of photoluminescence heterogeneity in the films studied herein. These results point to surface passivation and inter-grain connectivity as areas that could yield improvements in perovskite solar cell and optoelectronic device performance.",

    "articleAbstract": "Attachment to cellular surfaces is a major attribute among infectious pathogens for initiating disease pathogenesis. In viral infections, viruses exploit receptor-ligand interactions to latch onto cellular exterior prior to subsequent entry and invasion. In light of the selective binding affinity between viral pathogens and cells, nanoparticles cloaked in cellular membranes are herein employed for virus targeting. Using influenza virus as a model, erythrocyte membrane cloaked nanoparticles are prepared and modified with magnetic functionalities (RBC-mNP) for virus targeting and isolation. To maximize targeting and isolation efficiency, density gradient centrifugation and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied to minimize presence of uncoated particles and membrane vesicles. The resulting nanoparticles possess a distinctive membrane corona, a sialylated surface, and form colloidally stable clusters with influenza viruses. Magnetic functionality is bestowed to the nanoparticles through encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles, which enable influenza virus enrichment via magnetic extraction. Viral samples enriched by the RBC-mNPs result in significantly enhanced virus detection by multiple virus quantification methods, including qRT-PCR, immunnochromatographic strip test, and cell-based titering assays. The demonstration of pathogen targeting and isolation by RBC-mNPs highlights a biologically inspired approach towards improved treatment and diagnosis against infectious disease threats. The work also sheds light on the efficient membrane cloaking mechanism that bestows nanoparticles with cell mimicking functionalities.",

In vitro tests in buffer solutions at pH=7.4 reveal that fluorescence of the CPT in the hybrid nanoparticles is quenched due to the nanoparticle surface energy transfer (NSET) effect, but under acidic condition, the CPT fluorescence is gradually recovered with gradual release of the CPT molecules from the hybrid nanoparticles through cleavage of the acid-labile bond. The NSET \"on\" and \"off\" is induced by the CPT-AgNPs distance change. This unique property makes it possible to track the CPT delivery and releasing process from the hybrid nanoparticles in the living cells in a real time manner. The internalization and intracellular releasing tests of the hybrid nanoparticles in the HeLa cells demonstrate that the lysosome containing the hybrid nanoparticles displays CPT blue fluorescence due to releasing of the CPT under acidic condition and the drug releasing kinetics shows fluorescence increase of the released CPT with incubation time. The cytotoxicity of hybrid nanoparticles is dependent on activity of the acid-labile bond. Therefore, this is a potential efficient drug delivery system in cancer therapy and a useful approach to study the mechanism of release process in the cells.",

    "articleAbstract": "The efficient immobilization of enzymes on favorable supporting materials to design enzyme electrodes endowed with specific catalysis performances such as deep oxidation of biofuels, and direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis is highly desired for fabricating enzymatic biofuel cells (BFCs). In this study, carbon nanodots (CNDs) have been used as the immobilizing matrixes and electron relays of enzymes to construct NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase cascades-based bioanode for the deep oxidation of methanol and DET-type laccase-based biocathode for oxygen reduction to water. At the bioanode, multiplex enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) are co-immobilized on CNDs electrode which is previously coated with in situ polymerized methylene blue (polyMB) as the electrocatalyst for oxidizing NADH to NAD+. At the biocathode, fungal laccase is directly cast on CNDs and facilitated DET reaction is allowed. As a result, a novel membrane-less methanol/O2 BFC has been assembled and displays a high open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.71(± 0.02) V and a maximum power density of 68.7 (±0.4) µWcm-2. These investigated features imply that CNDs may act as new conductive architectures to elaborate enzyme electrodes for further bioelectrochemical applications.",

    "articleAbstract": "Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) respond in a dose-dependent manner to millimolar (0-10) levels of sodium sulfide (NaHS). No measurable increase in caspase-3 activity and no change in the extent of autophagy (or mitophagy) was observed in BPAEC. However, lactate dehydrogenase levels increased in the BPAEC exposed NaHS indicating necrotic cell death. In the case of galactose-conditioned BPAEC, the toxicity of NaHS was increased by 30% compared to that observed in BPAEC maintained in the regular glucose-containing culture medium, indicating a link between mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the mechanism of toxicant action. This is consistent with the widely held view that cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV of the mitochondrial electron-transport system) is the principal molecular target involved in the acute toxicity of \"sulfide\" (H2S/HS-). In support of this view, elevated NO (which can reverse cytochrome c oxidase inhibition) ameliorated the toxicity of NaHS and, conversely, suppression of endogenous NO production exacerbated the observed toxicity. Respirometric measurements showed the BPAEC to possess a robust sulfide oxidizing system, which was able to out-compete cytochrome c oxidase for available H2S/HS- at micromolar concentrations. This detoxification system has previously been reported by other groups in several cell types, but notably, not neurons. The findings appear to provide some insight into the question of why human survivors of H2S inhalation frequently present at the clinic with respiratory insufficiency/pulmonary edema, while acutely poisoned laboratory animals tend to either succumb to cardiopulmonary paralysis or fully recover without any intervention.",

Their use as electron shuttles is demonstrated via an intra-electron transfer chain between neighboring redox units of clustered particles (Dh,DLS = 195 nm) and the mono- and tri-nuclear Cu sites of bilirubin oxidases. Enhanced current densities for mediated O2 reduction are observed with the redox nanoparticle system compared to equivalent bioelectrode cells with dissolved mediator. Improved catalytic stability over two days was also observed with the redox nanoparticles, highlighting a stabilizing effect of the polymeric architecture.

    "articleAbstract": "This article reports an experimental demonstration of photoinduced bulk polarization in hysteresis-free methylammonium (MA) lead-halide perovskite solar cells [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/PEI/Ag]. An anomalous capacitance-voltage (CV) signal is observed with a broad \"shoulder\" in the depletion region from -0.5 V to +0.5 V under photoexcitation based on CV measurements where a DC bias is gradually scanned to continuously drift ions in order to detect local polarization under a low alternating bias (50 mV, 5 KHz). Essentially, gradually scanning DC bias and applying a low alternating bias can separately generate continuously drifting ions and bulk CV signal from local polarization under photoexcitation. Particularly, when the device efficiency is improved from 12.41% to 18.19% upon chlorine incorporation, this anomalous CV signal can be enhanced by a factor of 3. This anomalous CV signal can be assigned as the signature of photoinduced bulk polarization by distinguishing from surface polarization associated with interfacial charge accumulation. Meanwhile, replacing easy-rotational MA(+) with difficult-rotational formamidinium (FA(+)) cations largely minimizes such anomalous CV signal, suggesting that photoinduced bulk polarization relies on the orientational freedom of dipolar organic cations. Furthermore, Kelvin-probe force microscopy study shows that chlorine incorporation can suppress the density of charged defects, and thus enhances photoinduced bulk polarization due to the reduced screening effect from charged defects. Bias-dependent photoluminescence study indicates that increasing bulk polarization can suppress carrier recombination by decreasing charge capture probability through Coulombic screening effect. Clearly, our studies provide an insightful understanding of photoinduced bulk polarization and its effects on photovoltaic actions in perovskite solar cells.",

Cyclization to form pyrrolidines, piperidines or morpholines results in a preorganization of the whole system in solution. The resulting conformation is similar to the conformation of the inhibitor in the active site of BACE-1. This entropic gain results in increased affinity for the enzyme when compared with the acyclic system. For morpholines 27 and 29, the combination of steric and electronic factors is exploited to orient substituents toward S1, S1' and S2' pockets both in the solution and in the bound states. These highly preorganized molecules proved to be the most potent compounds of the series. Additionally, the morpholines, unlike the pyrrolidine and piperidine analogs, have been found to be brain penetrant BACE-1 inhibitors.",

We report on the rapid bulk synthesis of photocatalytic nanoparticles with homogeneous shape and size via the cathodic corrosion method, a simple electrochemical approach applied for the first time to the versatile preparation of complex metal oxides. Nanoparticles consisting of tungsten oxide (H2WO4) nanoplates, titanium oxide (TiO¬2) nanowires, and symmetric star-shaped bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) were prepared conveniently using tungsten, titanium, and vanadium wires as a starting material. Each of the particles were extremely rapid to produce, taking only 2-3 minutes to etch 2.5 mm of metal wire into a colloidal dispersion of photoactive materials. All crystalline H2WO4 and BiVO4 particles and amorphous TiO2 were photoelectrochemically active towards the water oxidation reaction. Additionally, the BiVO4 particles showed enhanced photoactivity in the visible region towards the oxidation of a sacrificial sulfite reagent. This synthetic method provides an inexpensive alternative to conventional fabrication techniques and is potentially applicable to a wide variety of metal oxides, making the rapid fabrication of active photocatalysts with controlled crystallinity more efficient.",

The diverse bioactivities of kudingcha could derive from its phenolic compounds, but the effects of dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQAs) from Ilex kudingcha on intestinal microbiota have not been investigated. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing and anaerobic fermentation in vitro were utilized to investigate the microecology modulating function of I. kudingcha diCQAs. As results, diCQAs raised the diversity and exhibited more considerable impact than carbon source on microbial profile. DiCQAs increased the relative abundances of Alistipes, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Butyricimonas, Clostridium sensu stricto, Escherichia/Shigella, Parasutterella, Romboutsia, Oscillibacter, Veillonella, Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, Gemmiger, Streptococcus and Haemophilus, and decreased the relative abundances of Ruminococcus, Anaerostipes, Dialister, Megasphaera, Megamonas and Prevotella. DiCQAs also affected the generation of short-chain fatty acids through microbiota. The contents of acetic and lactic acids were raised, while the production of propionic and butyric acids were reduced. Conclusively, diCQAs from I. kudingcha had significant modulating effects on intestinal microbiota in vitro, which might be the fundament of diCQAs exerting their bioactivities.",

    "articleAbstract": "Here, we analyze the effect of Cr doping on WSe2 crystals. The topology and the chemistry of the doped samples have been investigated by atom-resolved STEM microscopy combined with EEL spectroscopy. Cr (measured to have formal valence 3+) occupies W sites (formal valence 4+), indicating a possible hole doping. However, single or double Se-vacancies cluster near Cr atoms, leading to an effective electron doping. These defects organization can be explained by the strong binding energy of the CrW-Vse complex obtained by in DFT calculations. In highly Cr-doped samples, a local phase transition from the 2H to the to 1T phase is observed, which has been previously reported for other electron-doped transition metal dichalcogenides. Cr-doped crystals suffers a compressive strain, resulting in an isotropic lattice contraction and in an anisotropic optical bandgap energy shift (25 meV in-plane and 80 meV out-of-plane).",

    "articleAbstract": "Biochemical screening is a major source of lead generation for novel targets. However, during the process of small molecule lead optimization, compounds with excellent biochemical activity may show poor cellular potency, making structure-activity relationships difficult to decipher. This may be due to low membrane permeability of the molecule, resulting in insufficient intracellular drug concentration. The Cell Squeeze® platform increases permeability regardless of compound structure by mechanically disrupting the membrane, which can overcome permeability limitations and bridge the gap between biochemical and cellular studies. In this study, we show that poorly permeable Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are delivered into primary cells using Cell Squeeze®, inhibiting up to 90% of the JAK pathway, while incubation of JAK inhibitors with or without electroporation had no significant effect. We believe this robust intracellular delivery approach could enable more effective lead optimization and deepen our understanding of target engagement by small molecules and functional probes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Heterostructured dielectric-dielectric nanowires of SiC core and carbon shell (SiC@C) with high-performance electromagnetic wave absorption were synthesized by combining an interfacial in situ polymer encapsulation and carbonization process. This approach overcomes the shortcomings of previous reported methods to prepare carbon shell that both carbon shell and free carbon particles are formed simultaneously. In our developed approach, the core of SiC nanowires are firstly positively charged. Then, the negative resorcinol-formaldehyde polymers as the carbon source are anchored on SiC nanowires under the attraction of electrostatic force, which well suppresses the nucleation of free carbon particles. The thickness of the carbon shell could be modulated from 4 to 20 nm by simply adjusting the moral ratio of resorcinol to SiC nanowires. The resulting SiC@C core-shell nanostructures without free carbon particles offer synergism among the SiC nanowires and the carbon shells, generating multiple dipolar polarization, surfaced polarization and associated relaxations, which endows SiC@C hybrid nanowires with a minimum reflection loss (RL) value of -50 dB at the frequency of 12 GHz and an effective absorption bandwidth of 8 GHz with RL value under -10 dB at the optimized state. Our results demonstrate that SiC@C hybrid nanowires are promising candidates for electromagnetic wave absorption applications.",

A computed tomography scan demonstrated enlarged heterogeneous kidneys and a large complex collection in the right kidney, likely hemorrhagic in nature. The findings were suspicious for bilateral angiomyolipomas with retroperitoneal hematoma. She was treated with bilateral transarterial embolization. She subsequently developed recurrent fever and was suspected of having emphysematous pyelonephritis, for which she underwent a right nephrectomy. The entire kidney was replaced by a tan bulging, lobular mass, with scattered tan-yellow nodules. Microscopic examination revealed an angiomyolipoma with an incidental oncocytoma. The association of renal angiomyolipoma and renal oncocytoma is rare and only 16 cases have been previously reported.",

He was also noted to have a brief cardiac tachyarrhythmia. Coronary arteriography revealed vasospasm of the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery, which were relieved to a significant extent after administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin. Subsequent angiograms and fractional flow reserve studies, demonstrated underlying non-obstructive coronary artery disease at the sites of spasm. No percutaneous coronary intervention was pursued.

    "articleAbstract": "Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods, including the intrauterine device (IUD) and the birth control implant, are the most effective form of prescribed birth control for pregnancy prevention. However, uptake of this highly effective form of birth control is slow. The purpose of this study was to explore use of the LARC methods in South Dakota women prescribed contraception and the importance of the provider in promoting this type of contraception.This was a cross-sectional study of female patients who had been prescribed contraception at one of five locations in a South Dakota hospital system. Records were obtained through electronic health records for a six-month period. Descriptive analysis was performed using chi-square with counts and percentages. Logistic regression was used to determine differences in LARC prescriptions by patient age and provider title.A total of 2,174 individual patients were included in analysis. Of the 378 (17.4 percent) who were prescribed LARC methods, most (78.6 percent) were prescribed an IUD. Younger women (aged 11-19) were less likely to be prescribed LARCs compared to women aged 30-34. There were also significant differences in LARC prescriptions by provider type. Futhermore, we noted differences in LARC prescriptions for a provider who received a specific education and training on LARC from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.There are many important factors to consider by the patient when choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method, including safety, effectiveness, accessibility, and affordability. Provider education may play an important role in promoting LARC methods.",

    "articleAbstract": "Because of their anatomical situation, the olfactory nerves constitute a natural obstacle to exploring the anterior cranial fossa, making them vulnerable to traumatic, tumor, or iatrogenic lesions. Consequently, accurate knowledge of their microsurgical anatomy is of particular importance for surgeons to ensure the correct execution of surgical procedures with minimal sequelae, the least functional deterioration, and better therapeutic results. This review describes the functional and microsurgical anatomy of the olfactory nerves, illustrated with pictures of simulations based on cadaveric dissections and original illustrations of the central connections of the olfactory pathway.

    "articleAbstract": "When there is substantial heterogeneity of treatment effectiveness, it is crucial to identify individualized treatment assignment rules for comparative treatment selection. Traditional approaches directly model clinical outcome and define optimal treatment rule according to the interactions between treatment and covariates. This approach relies on the success of separating the main effects from the covariate-treatment interaction effects, which may not be easy. To overcome this shortcoming, a recent approach, called outcome weighted learning, focuses on building an optimal treatment rule by maximizing the expected clinical outcome related with differential treatments. However, there seems to be a lack of approaches to explicitly deal with three or more treatments. In this article, we propose an outcome weighted learning method that extends estimating individualized treatment rules to multi-treatment case by using a vector hinge loss as a target function. Consistency of the resulting estimator is shown in the article. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in simulation studies and in a real data analysis.",

    "articleAbstract": "Children worldwide experience mental and emotional disorders. Mental disorders occurring among young children, especially infants (birth -3 years), often go unrecognized. Prevalence rates are difficult to determine because of lack of awareness and difficulty assessing and diagnosing young children. Existing data, however, suggest that rates of disorders in young children are comparable to those of older children and adolescents (von Klitzing, Dohnert, Kroll, & Grube, ). The lack of widespread recognition of disorders of infancy is particularly concerning due to the unique positioning of infancy as foundational in the developmental process. Both the brain and behavior are in vulnerable states of development across the first 3 years of life, with potential for enduring deviations to occur in response to early trauma and deprivation. Intervention approaches for young children require sensitivity to their developmental needs within their families. The primacy of infancy as a time of unique foundational risks for disorder, the impact of trauma and violence on young children's development, the impact of family disruption on children's attachment, and existing literature on prevalence rates of early disorders are discussed. Finally, global priorities for addressing these disorders of infancy are highlighted to support prevention and intervention actions that may alleviate suffering among our youngest world citizens.",

    "articleAbstract": "Heart defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in CHD7 are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in CHARGE syndrome. Here we review the clinical and molecular aspects of CHD7 that are related to the cardiovascular manifestations of the syndrome. The types of heart defects found in patients with CHD7 mutations are variable, with an overrepresentation of atrioventricular septal defect and outflow tract defect including aortic arch anomalies compared to nonsyndromic heart defects. Chd7 haploinsufficiency in mouse is a good model for studying the heart effects seen in CHARGE syndrome, and mouse models reveal a role for Chd7 in multiple lineages during heart development. Formation of the great vessels requires Chd7 expression in the pharyngeal surface ectoderm, and this expression likely has an non-autonomous effect on neural crest cells. In the cardiogenic mesoderm, Chd7 is required for atrioventricular cushion development and septation of the outflow tract. Emerging knowledge about the function of CHD7 in the heart indicates that it may act in concert with transcription factors such as TBX1 and SMADs to regulate genes such as p53 and the cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5.",

    "articleAbstract": "The annulus fibrosus (AF) of the intervertebral disc (IVD) has a zonal distribution of phenotypically distinct cells. The outer AF (OAF) cells produce an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in type I collagen with little proteoglycans, whereas the ECM of the inner AF (IAF) has abundant type II collagen and proteoglycans. The inhomogeneous distribution of the ECM in the AF may reflect the complex mechanical forces that the IVD experiences. A bioengineered AF tissue should recapitulate both the inner and outer zones in order to have proper functionality. The aim of this study is to generate multi-lamellated OAF and IAF tissues with ECM compositions that resemble their zonal origin using polycarbonate urethane (PU) scaffolds. It was observed that supplementation of the media with insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) and proline yielded tissues with good cellularity. However, IAF cells accumulated only type I collagen, similar to OAF cells. Addition of dexamethasone and sodium pyruvate induced the accumulation of IAF tissues rich in type II collagen and aggrecan, without altering the accumulation of type I collagen in OAF tissues. Dexamethasone stimulated mitochondrial membrane potential in both tissues in the presence of sodium pyruvate, suggesting a relationship between the mitochondrial aerobic respiratory state and dexamethasone signalling during the in vitro-tissue formation by OAF and IAF cells. Inhibition of the glucocorticoid receptor blocked the stimulation of mitochondrial membrane potentials and type II collagen accumulation. In summary, biologically distinct multi-lamellated OAF and IAF tissues can be generated, which will facilitate advancement towards the goal of engineering a biological IVD replacement.

    "articleAbstract": "The availability of a real-time assay to experimentally investigate the release of encapsulated proteins would be beneficial given the interest in the use of liposomes as a drug delivery vehicle. Although simple assays for small molecular weight substances exist, assays to evaluate macromolecules do not.Here we describe a method that detects the release of model macromolecules from liposomes in real-time.The assay employs the intermolecular distance-dependent phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorophore donor, fluorescein (FITC), and fluorescent quencher, QSY®9. The macromolecular species were conjugated to the markers fluorescein (44 kDa dextran) and QSY®9 (67 kDa bovine serum albumin, BSA).Following confirmation of quenching between FITC-Dex and QSY®9-BSA, liposomes were loaded with the macromolecular markers and subjected to various treatments (high-pressure extrusion and Triton X solubilisation) to cause release from liposomes. An increase in FITC fluorescence was observed when liposomes were subjected to extrusion cycles. Surprisingly, the addition of Triton X did not cause an increase in fluorescence probably because the FRET pair become associated with mixed micelles.This assay method should be useful in studies to investigate the mechanisms by which macromolecules are released from liposomes, particularly when liposomes are exposed to release-triggers (eg temperature change, pH change, ultrasound). Such understanding will underpin the formulation of triggered liposomal delivery systems for macromolecules.",

The chief conclusion across studies is that the role of paternal play is important in various domains of child development. This is encouraging, yet also disturbing given the results of the State of the World's Fathers: Time for Action report 2017, revealing the low amount of care fathers provide to their children worldwide, relative to mothers. In this commentary, the measurement and conceptualization of play are discussed, as well as cultural considerations regarding the meaning and consequences of play. The findings of the studies are integrated in order to guide future research, addressing what domains of child development appear to be influenced by what types of paternal play, and discussing the contexts that affect paternal play. Lastly, the collective results are related to recent efforts to increase fathers' involvement and implications for interventions are discussed.",

    "articleAbstract": "A spin-forbidden chemical reaction involves a change in the total electronic spin state from reactants to products. The mechanistic study is challenging, since such a reaction does not occur on a single diabatic potential energy surface (PES), but rather on two (or multiple) spin diabatic PESs. One possible approach is to calculate the so-called \"Minimum Energy Crossing Point\" (MECP) between the diabatic PESs, which however is not a stationary point. Inclusion of Spin Orbit Coupling between spin states (SOC approach) allows the reaction to occur on a single adiabatic PES, where a transition state (TS SOC) as well as an activation free energy can be calculated. This Concept article summarizes a previously published application where for the first time the SOC effects, using spin-orbit ZORA Hamiltonian within density functional theory (DFT) framework, are included and account for the mechanism of a spin-forbidden reaction in gold chemistry. The merits of the MECP and TS SOC approaches and the accuracy of the results are compared, considering both our recent calculations on molecular oxygen addition to gold(I)-hydride complexes and new calculations for the prototype spin-forbidden N2O and N2Se dissociation reactions.",

    "articleAbstract": "Gigantopyramidal neurons, referred to as Betz cells in primates are characterized by large somata and extensive basilar dendrites. Although there have been morphological descriptions and drawings of gigantopyramidal neurons in a limited number of species, quantitative investigations have typically been limited to measures of soma size. The current study thus employed two separate analytical approaches: a morphological investigation using the Golgi technique to provide qualitative and quantitative somatodendritic measures of gigantopyramidal neurons across 19 mammalian species from 7 orders; and unbiased stereology to compare the soma volume of layer V pyramidal and gigantopyramidal neurons in primary motor cortex between 11 carnivore and 9 primate species. Of the 617 neurons traced in the morphological analysis, 181 were gigantopyramidal neurons, with deep (primarily layer V) pyramidal (n = 203) and superficial (primarily layer III) pyramidal (n = 233) neurons quantified for comparative purposes. Qualitatively, dendritic morphology varied considerably across species, with some (sub)orders (e.g., artiodactyls, perissodactyls, feliforms) exhibiting bifurcating, V-shaped apical dendrites. Basilar dendrites exhibited idiosyncratic geometry across and within taxonomic groups. Quantitatively, most dendritic measures were significantly greater in gigantopyramidal neurons than in superficial and deep pyramidal neurons. Cluster analyses revealed that most taxonomic groups could be discriminated based on somatodendritic morphology for both superficial and gigantopyramidal neurons. Finally, in agreement with Brodmann, gigantopyramidal neurons in both the morphological and stereological analyses were larger in feliforms (especially in the Panthera species) than in other (sub)orders, possibly due to specializations in muscle fiber composition and musculoskeletal systems.

This study evaluated the ability of clinical and anatomical factors to predict surgical difficulty in total mesorectal excision.Consecutive patients who underwent total mesorectal excision for locally advanced rectal cancer in a laparoscopic, robotic or open procedure after neoadjuvant treatment, between 2005 and 2014, were included in this retrospective study. Preoperative clinical and MRI data were studied to develop a surgical difficulty grade.In total, 164 patients with a median age of 61 (range 26-86) years were considered to be at low risk (143, 87·2 per cent) or high risk (21, 12·8 per cent) of surgical difficulty. In multivariable analysis, BMI at least 30 kg/m(2) (P = 0·021), coloanal anastomosis (versus colorectal) (P = 0·034), intertuberous distance less than 10·1 cm (P = 0·041) and mesorectal fat area exceeding 20·7 cm(2) (P = 0·051) were associated with greater surgical difficulty. A four-item score (ranging from 0 to 4), with each item (BMI, type of surgery, intertuberous distance and mesorectal fat area) scored 0 (absence) or 1 (presence), is proposed. Patients can be considered at high risk of a difficult or challenging operation if they have a score of 3 or more.This simple morphometric score may assist surgical decision-making and comparative study by defining operative difficulty before surgery.",

    "articleAbstract": "Registration and publication of trial protocols has become increasingly important and a requirement in some sources of funding and publication. Increased access to protocols yields many potential benefits, but there are issues regarding identification of published protocols. The aim of this investigation is to compare methods of retrieval for identifying trial protocols in a systematic review.Six stages of searching (checking published trial reports, searching journal websites, Internet searching, trial registers, bibliographic databases, contact with authors) were completed to identify 74 trial protocols.57% of the trial protocols were identified upon completion of all six stages of searching. The most comprehensive method was searching trial registers which identified 51% of the protocols. Contact with authors was most effective at uniquely identifying protocols, 12% were retrieved via this single method. Contact with authors was the only effective method of identifying protocols for trials pre-2005.When attempting to identify trial protocols to include in systematic reviews, some methods are relatively quick to undertake but deliver a low yield. The most effective search strategy for most sources was retrieval by trial registration number where available.For protocols of trial results published pre-2005, review authors should contact authors as a priority. For protocols post-2005, they should check the trial publication for protocol details, search trial registers, contact authors, ceasing searching once a predetermined point of diminishing returns has been reached.",

    "articleAbstract": "Based on the premise that father-child play is an important context for children's development and that fathers \"specialize\" in play, similarities and differences in the role of playfulness in the father-child and mother-child relationship were examined. Participants in this study included 111 families (children's age: 1-3 years). Father-child and mother-child play interactions were videotaped and coded for parental playfulness, sensitivity, structuring, and nonintrusiveness as well as child negativity. Results indicated that mothers and fathers did not differ in playfulness and that mothers and fathers who were higher in playfulness had children with lower levels of negativity. However, playfulness differently moderated the links between parents' and children's behaviors for mothers and fathers. A double-risk pattern was found for mothers, such that the links between child negativity and maternal sensitivity, structuring, and nonintrusiveness were significant only for the subgroup of mothers with low levels of playfulness. When mothers had high levels of playfulness, these effects were negligible. For fathers, a double-buffer pattern was revealed, indicating that the links between child negativity and paternal sensitivity and structuring were significant only for fathers with high levels of playfulness. When fathers had low levels of playfulness, these effects were negligible. These findings demonstrate the important role that parental playfulness has on parent-child interaction as well as the need to examine moderation patterns separately for fathers and mothers.",

    "articleAbstract": "CHARGE syndrome (CS) is a complex genetic disorder causing multiple birth defects and sensory deficits (hearing, vision, balance, smell). Genetic counseling in CS must include not only the provision of factual information about CS, its cause, and inheritance, but also information about the developmental implications of CS features, referral to appropriate resources, and assistance with psychosocial adaptation to this information. CS should be considered in patients with any of the major diagnostic features: coloboma, choanal atresia, semicircular canal anomalies, or cranial nerve anomalies. The prime candidates in the differential are 22q11.2 deletion and Kabuki syndromes. Evaluation of features of CS, dysmorphology examination, and genetic testing can usually distinguish between the three conditions. Genetic counseling is important from early on, to help the family understand the process of genetic diagnosis, to interpret information coming from other specialists and to provide support and resources. Parents can easily be overwhelmed with the complexity of issues facing their child at diagnosis and in the future. CS is a substantial burden on a child, with high early mortality, multiple illnesses, hospitalizations and surgeries, and apparent medical fragility throughout life. The medical complexity of CS disrupts family life and contributes to delayed development. Multiple sensory deficits (impaired vision, hearing, and balance) further contribute to delayed motor and language development despite many individuals with CS having normal intelligence. Early referral to specialists in deafblindness and sensory deficits is essential. Resources are available to assist genetic counselors in diagnosis, follow-up, and management of patients with CS.",

In this paper, a sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous determination of GE and GP in rat plasma. We found GP degraded rapidly in rat plasma at room temperature as a result of the irreversible binding with the endogenous nucleophiles in plasma. GP is stable when the samples pH is less than or equal to 4.0. The degradation of GP in rat plasma was well prevented by immediate addition of 5% glacial acetic acid to the freshly collected plasma. The detection was performed on a tandem mass spectrometer coupled with electrospray ionization source in negative mode. Quantification was conducted by multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions of at [M+CH3 COO](-) m/z 447.3→225.3 for GE, and at [M-H](-) m/z 225.2→123.1 for GP. The method exhibited high sensitivity (LLOQ of 1 ng/mL for GE and 0.2 ng/ml for GP) by selecting the acetate adduct ions as the precursor ion for GE. The robust developed method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats after oral administration of GE.",

This is due to the inability of the host immunity to respond appropriately to Aspergillus. An established risk factor for IA is neutropenia which is encountered by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Herein we investigate the role of neutrophils in modulating host response to Aspergillus. We found that neutrophils had the propensity to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production but through different mechanisms for specific cytokines. Cellular contact was requisite for the modulation of interleukin-1 beta production by Aspergillus with the involvement of complement receptor 3. On the other hand, inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production (TNF-α) was cell contact-independent and mediated by secreted myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specifically, the inhibition of TNF-α by MPO was through the TLR4 pathway and involved interference with the mRNA transcription of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) / interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). Our study illustrates the extended immune modulatory role of neutrophils beyond its primary phagocytic function. The absence of neutrophils and loss of its inhibitory effect on cytokine production explains the hypercytokinemia seen in neutropenic patients when infected with Aspergillus.",

    "articleAbstract": "Although there is increasing evidence of paternal influence on child outcomes such as language and cognition, researchers are not yet clear on the features of father-child play that are most valuable in terms of child development. Physical play such as rough and tumble play (RTP) is a favored type of father-child play in Western societies that has been linked to children's socioemotional competence. It is important, therefore, to determine the implications of this play for child development. In this review and meta-analysis, associations between father-child physical play and child behavior were examined. The review also focused on study methods. Sixteen studies are reviewed, N = 1,521 father-child dyads, 35% boys. Study characteristics such as definitions of physical play, play settings, play measures, and coding were examined. The meta-analysis found weak to moderate population effects for links between father-child physical play and child aggression, social competence, emotional skills, and self-regulation. Research investigating the effect of father-child physical play on children's development will be improved when definitions clearly identify the nature of play, settings facilitate boisterous play, and measures include frequency and quality of play interactions. This play shows promise as an enhancer of positive father-child relationships and a catalyst for child development.",

    "articleAbstract": "This article describes a polynomial growth curve quantile regression model that provides a comprehensive assessment about the treatment effects on the changes of the distribution of outcomes over time. The proposed model has the flexibility, as it allows the degree of a polynomial to vary across quantiles. A high degree polynomial model fits the data adequately, yet it is not desirable due to the complexity of the model. We propose the model selection criterion based on an empirical loglikelihood that consistently identifies the optimal degree of a polynomial at each quantile. After the parsimonious model is fitted to the data, the hypothesis test is further developed to evaluate the treatment effects by comparing the growth curves. It is shown that the proposed empirical loglikelihood ratio test statistic follows a chi-square distribution asymptotically under the null hypothesis. Various simulation studies confirm that the proposed test successfully detects the difference between the curves across quantiles. When the empirical loglikelihood is employed, we incorporate the within-subject correlation commonly existing in longitudinal data and gain estimation efficiency of the quantile regression parameters in the growth curve model. The proposed process is illustrated through the analysis of randomized controlled longitudinal depression data.",

    "articleAbstract": "Characteristics of attachment were assessed in peer- and object-reared lambs, and compared to mothered subjects by taking into consideration distress, proximity seeking, and exploration during two separation-reunion tests in both the familiar and a novel environment. Plasma cortisol and oxytocin were assayed as physiological indicators of stress and being comforted during the separation-reunion test. Rewarding properties of the familiar figures were also determined in a conditioned place preference-like paradigm. Between-group analysis revealed the existence of secure attachment with the mother, alteration of secure attachment with the peer and weaker attachment with the object. Weaker attachment was expressed by a lack of distress during separation in the home pen and no preference for the place conditioned with the familiar object. Elevated basal plasma oxytocin levels, but not cortisol, observed in maternally deprived lambs were more likely linked to the absence of a maternal figure rather than social comfort during reunion.",

    "articleAbstract": "Aristolochic acid (AA) causes interstitial renal fibrosis, which called aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). There is no specific indicator for diagnosing AAN, so this study was to investigate the biomarkers for AAN using a proteomics method. The C3H/He female mice were given ad libitum AA-distilled water (0.5 mg/kg/day) and distilled water for 56 days in the AA and normal groups, respectively. The AA-induced proteins in the kidney were investigated using a proteomics study, including fluorogenic derivatization with 7-chloro-N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,1,3- benzoxadiazole-4-sulfonamide (DAABD-Cl), and followed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (FD-LC-MS/MS) with a MASCOT database searching system. There were two altered proteins, thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) and G protein-coupled receptor 87 (GPR87), in the kidney of AA-group mice on day 56. GPR87, tumorigenesis-related protein, was newly reported in the current study. The renal interstitial fibrosis was certainly induced in the AA-group mice under the observation of histological examination. Based on the results of histological examination and proteomics study, this model might be applied to AAN studies in the future. TSP1 might be a novel biomarker for AAN, and the further role of GPR87 leading to AA-induced tumorigenesis should be researched in future studies.",

    "articleAbstract": "This work is motivated by a desire to quantify relationships between two time series of pulsing hormone concentrations. The locations of pulses are not directly observed and may be considered latent event processes. The latent event processes of pulsing hormones are often associated. It is this joint relationship we model. Current approaches to jointly modeling pulsing hormone data generally assume that a pulse in one hormone is coupled with a pulse in another hormone (one-to-one association). However, pulse coupling is often imperfect. Existing joint models are not flexible enough for imperfect systems. In this article, we develop a more flexible class of pulse association models that incorporate parameters quantifying imperfect pulse associations. We propose a novel use of the Cox process model as a model of how pulse events co-occur in time. We embed the Cox process model into a hormone concentration model. Hormone concentration is the observed data. Spatial birth and death Markov chain Monte Carlo is used for estimation. Simulations show the joint model works well for quantifying both perfect and imperfect associations and offers estimation improvements over single hormone analyses. We apply this model to luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), two reproductive hormones. Use of our joint model results in an ability to investigate novel hypotheses regarding associations between LH and FSH secretion in obese and non-obese women.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prognostic value of primary tumour resection in patients presenting with metastatic colorectal cancer.A systematic review of MEDLINE/PubMed was performed on 12 March 2016, with no language or date restrictions, for studies comparing primary tumour resection versus conservative treatment without primary tumour resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. The quality of the studies was assessed using the MINORS and STROBE criteria. Differences in survival, morbidity and mortality between groups were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis.Of 37 412 initially screened articles, 56 retrospective studies with 148 151 patients met the inclusion criteria. Primary tumour resection led to an improvement in overall survival of 7·76 (95 per cent c.i. 5·96 to 9·56) months (risk ratio (RR) for overall survival 0·50, 95 per cent c.i. 0·47 to 0·53), but did not significantly reduce the risk of obstruction (RR 0·50, 95 per cent c.i. 0·16 to 1·53) or bleeding (RR 1·19, 0·48 to 2·97). Neither was the morbidity risk altered (RR 1·14, 0·77 to 1·68). Heterogeneity between the studies was high, with a calculated I(2) of more than 50 per cent for most outcomes.Primary tumour resection may provide a modest survival advantage in patients presenting with metastatic colorectal cancer.",

    "articleAbstract": "Quantitative estimates of the groundwater depletion and droughts in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin (TEB) can be useful for sustainably managing its water resources. Here, data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are used to infer the monthly changes in the total water storage of the TEB from January 2003 to December 2015. Additionally, the data of altimetry and output from land surface models are used to remove the contributions from lake water changes and other hydrological factors to obtain the total groundwater depletion (TGWD), human-driven groundwater depletion (HGWD), and climate-driven groundwater depletion. We conclude that an alarming rate of decrease in the total water storage and the loss of TGWD have an \"accelerating\" trend, as the trend during 2007 to 2015 was 3.6 times that during 2003 to 2006. Moreover, the HGWD is 116.09 Gt, which accounts for 98% of the TGWD. Finally, the total storage deficit index (TSDI) is derived from the GRACE data to characterize the drought of the TEB. The results show that TSDI agrees well with the actual drought rather than the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and that the TEB has been undergoing a severe drought since September 2007 according to both the TSDI and PDSI. The research in this study provides an effective and unique method for understanding the hydrological processes and sustainable use of water resources in regions or countries with little data, which is essential for more efficient, sustainable, and cross-boundary cooperative water resource management.",

In this paper, the method LVSS combined with CZE has been proposed to analysis the camptothecin alkaloids. Optimum separation can be achieved in conditions as following: pH 9.0, 25 mM borate buffer containing 20 mM Sulfobutylether-β-Cyclod- extrin (SBE-β-CD) and 20 mM ionic liquid [EMIM] [L-Lac] (IL), the applied voltage was 20 kV and the capillary temperature was 25°C. The LVSS was optimized as hydrodynamic injection 4 s at 5.0 psi and the polarity switching time was 0.17 min. Under the above conditions, the analytes could be separated completely in less than 20 min and the detector response had been increased compared with conventional hydrodynamic injection. The limit of detection were between 0.20 and 0.78 μg/L. A good linearity could be obtained with correlation coefficients from 0.9991 to 0.9997. The recoveries ranged from 97.72 to 103.2% and the results demonstrated excellent accuracy. In terms of the migration time and peak area, the experiment was reproducible. And the experimental results indicated that baseline separation can be obtained and this method is suitable for the quantitative determination of camptothecin alkaloids in real samples.",

    "articleAbstract": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques used for management of adult spinal deformity (ASD) aim to decrease the physiological demand on patients and minimize postoperative complications. A circumferential MIS (cMIS) protocol offers the potential to maximize this advantage over standard open approaches, through the concurrent use of multiple MIS techniques.To demonstrate through a case example the execution of a cMIS protocol for management of an ASD patient with severe deformity.Thorough preoperative assessment, surgical planning, and medical optimization were completed. Deformity correction was performed over 2 stages. During the first stage, interbody fusion was performed via an oblique lateral approach at all levels of the lumbar spine intended to be included in the final construct. The patient was kept as an inpatient and mobilized postoperatively. They were then re-imaged with standing films. The second stage occurred after 3 d and involved percutaneous instrumentation of all levels. Posterior fusion of the thoracic levels was achieved through decortication of pars and facets. These areas were accessed through the intermuscular plane established by the percutaneous screws. The patient was mobilizing on their first postoperative day.In a 66-yr-old female with severe sagittal imbalance and debilitating back pain, effective use of this cMIS protocol allowed for correction of the Cobb angle from 52° to 4° correction of spinopelvic parameters and 13 cm of sagittal vertical axis improvement. No complications were identified by 2 yr postoperative.As a systematization of multiple MIS techniques combined, in a specific and staged manner, this cMIS protocol could provide a safe and effective approach to the management of ASD.",

    "articleAbstract": "To describe the disease characteristics, continuous course and long-term outcome and to evaluate predictors of outcome in JIA in Greece.We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 17 years' prospective data on JIA. Outcome assessment included radiographic (modified Sharp-van der Heidje score), articular and extra-articular damage (Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index), functional ability (HAQ Disability Index), and the cumulative percentage time spent in a state of active disease and also in clinical remission off medication (CR) (according to Wallace's criteria).One hundred and two (72 females) patients under regular follow-up were enrolled. The disease age of onset [mean (SD)] was 7.7 (4) years, the interval from onset to last visit was 17.2 (6.7) years and the patients' current age was 25 (5.9) years. At the last follow-up visit, 53 patients (52%) had disease activity, while 23.5% were in CR. The cumulative percentage time spent in a state of active disease and CR over the disease course was 52.6 and 17.8%, respectively. Polyarticular subtype of onset and longer disease activity during the first 5 years were independent predictors of worse outcome. Additional telephone-based interviews of 205 former JIA patients who had been lost to follow-up as adults were performed to extend the interpretation of our findings to a broader JIA population. Almost half (47.6%) of the total cohort of 307 patients were found to be in CR at the final evaluation and 69.7% had no disability.The available data indicate that JIA as a whole is a heterogeneous disease with significant variability in course and long-term outcome.",

    "articleAbstract": "Membrane transporters influence biological functions in the ocular lens. Here, we investigate the monocarboxylate transporter 12 (MCT12), also called creatine transporter 2 (CRT2), which is found in the ocular lens and is involved in cataract. As the age-related form affects about half of the population world-wide, understanding relevant pathomechanisms is a prerequisite for exploring non-invasive treatments. We screened the coding exons of the gene SLC16A12 in 877 patients from five cohorts, including Caucasian and Asian ethnicities. A previously identified risk factor, SNP rs3740030, displayed different frequencies in the Asian cohorts but risk could not be established. In 15 patients 13 very rare heterozygous nucleotide substitutions were identified, of which eight led to non-synonymous and four to synonymous amino acid exchanges and one mapped to the canonical splice site in intron 3. Their impact on creatine transport was tested in Xenopus laevis oocytes and human HEK293T cells. Four variants (p.Ser158Pro, p.Gly205Val, p.Pro395Gln and p.Ser453Arg) displayed severe reduction in both model systems, indicating conserved function. Two of these, p.Gly205Val, and p.Ser453Arg, did not localize to the oocyte membrane, suggesting possible impacts on protein interactions for transporter processing. In support, exogenously supplied excess of MCT12's chaperone CD147 in HEK293T cells led to a partial recovery of the defective uptake activity from p.Gly205Val and also from mutant p.Pro395Gln, which did localize to the membrane. Our findings provide first insight in the molecular requirements of creatine transporter, with particular emphasis on rescuing effects by its chaperone CD147, which can provide useful pharmacological information for substrate delivery.",

    "articleAbstract": "Genetic and epigenetic information are faithfully duplicated and accurately transmitted to daughter cells to preserve cell identity during the cell cycle. However, how the chromatin-based epigenetic information beyond DNA sequence is stably transmitted along with the disruption and re-establishment of chromatin structure within a cell cycle remains largely unexplored. Through comprehensive analysis DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning patterns of HepG2 cells in G0/G1, early S, late S and G2/M phases, we found that DNA methylation may act as the prime element for epigenetic inheritance after replication, as DNA methylation was extremely stable in each cell cycle phase, while nucleosome occupancy showed notable phase dependent fluctuation. Nucleosome-Secured Regions (NSRs) occupied by polycomb-repressed chromatin played a role in repressing the irrelevant cell type-specific genes and were essential for preventing irrelevant transcription factors binding, while the well-defined Nucleosome-Depleted Regions (NDRs) marked the genes crucial for cell identity maintenance. Chromatin structure at NSRs and NDRs was well maintained throughout the cell cycle, which played crucial roles in steadily preserving the transcriptional identity of the cell to fulfill cell identity maintenance. Collectively, our results demonstrated that while chromatin architecture underwent dynamic changes during cell cycle progression, DNA methylation together with NSRs and NDRs were stable epigenetic elements that were required for faithful transmission to the daughter cell to accurately maintain cell identity during the cell cycle.",

    "articleAbstract": "Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who also have acute coronary syndromes are a high-risk population with a high mortality rate. Little is known about these patients following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).Patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes between 2006 and 2014 with an angiogram showing 3-vessel disease or left main coronary artery involvement who were treated with CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) only were included from the nationwide SWEDEHEART registry. Patients were stratified according to COPD status and compared with regard to outcome. The primary end-point was the 5-year mortality rate; secondary outcomes were the 30-day mortality rate and in-hospital complications after CABG.We identified 6985 patients in the population who had CABG (COPD prevalence = 8.0%) and 14 209 who had PCI only (COPD = 8.2%). Patients with COPD were older and had more comorbidities than patients without COPD. The 5-year mortality rate was nearly doubled in patients with COPD versus patients without COPD (CABG: 27.2% vs 14.5%, P < 0.001; PCI only: 50.1% vs 29.1%, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities, patients with COPD in both CABG-treated [hazard ratio = 1.52 (1.25-1.86), P < 0.001] and PCI-treated populations still had a significantly higher 5-year mortality rate. COPD was also independently associated with significantly more postoperative infections in need of antibiotics [odds ratio = 1.48 (1.07-2.04), P = 0.017] and pneumonia [odds ratio = 2.21 (1.39-3.52), P = 0.001].Patients with COPD presenting with acute coronary syndromes and severe coronary artery disease are a high-risk population following CABG or PCI only, with higher risk of long-term and short-term death and postoperative infections. Preventive measures, including careful monitoring for signs of infection and prompt antibiotic treatment when indicated, should be considered.",

    "articleAbstract": "The pattern of lymph node metastasis is a predominant element in tumour biology, which is closely related to optimal therapeutic modality. Controversy remains as to which histopathology type of oesophageal cancer-adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-is more likely to have lymph node metastasis. Therefore, this study aimed to apply propensity score-matched analysis to draw an objective conclusion for providing initial evidence of the potential need for different therapeutic strategies for these 2 cancer types.A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent radical oesophagectomy with lymphadenectomy, but without preoperative treatment for pathologically and immunohistochemically diagnosed oesophageal adenocarcinoma or SCC, was conducted. Data for analysis included age, gender, body mass index, pathologic findings, procedures of oesophagectomy and rate of lymph node metastasis. Propensity score-matched analysis was conducted to eliminate the bias effects of confounding factors.A total of 1204 patients (including 118 with adenocarcinoma and 1086 with SCC) from January 2012 to June 2016 was included for analysis. In the analysis of unmatched patients, those with adenocarcinomas had significantly larger mean numbers of positive lymph nodes (3.8 and 1.5, respectively; P < 0.001) and higher rates of lymph node metastasis (71.2% and 49.0%, respectively; P < 0.001) than those with an SCC. However, other confounding factors such as surgical procedures, tumour location, pT stage and lymphovascular invasion also differed significantly between the adenocarcinoma and SCC cases. In the analysis of 96 matched patients, those confounding factors were well matched, and cases of adenocarcinoma still had a significantly larger mean number of positive lymph node (4.5 and 1.8, respectively; P = 0.003) and higher rate of lymph node metastasis (75.0% and 45.8%, respectively; P = 0.003) than did those with SCC.Cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma had a higher risk of lymph node metastasis than did those with SCC in this series, which indicates that different therapeutic modalities should be applied for these 2 different malignant entities.",

    "articleAbstract": "Adventitial cells have been suggested to contribute to neointima formation, but the functional relevance and the responsible signalling pathways are largely unknown. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a regulator of vasculogenesis and promotes angiogenesis in the adult.Here we show that proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) after wire-induced injury in C57BL/6 mice is preceded by proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts. Simultaneously, the expression of Shh and its downstream signalling protein smoothened (SMO) were robustly increased within injured arteries. In vitro, combined stimulation with Shh and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB strongly induced proliferation and migration of human adventitial fibroblasts. The supernatant of these activated fibroblasts contained high levels of interleukin-6 and -8 and strongly induced proliferation and migration of SMC. Inhibition of SMO selectively prevented fibroblast proliferation, cytokine release, and paracrine SMC activation. Mechanistically, we found that PDGF-BB activates protein kinase A in fibroblasts and thereby induces trafficking of SMO to the plasma membrane, where it can be activated by Shh. In vivo, SMO-inhibition significantly prevented the proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts and neointima formation following wire-induced injury.The initial activation of adventitial fibroblasts is essential for the subsequent proliferation of SMC and neointima formation. We identified SMO-dependent Shh signalling as a specific process for the activation of adventitial fibroblasts.",

    "articleAbstract": "Canonical innate immune signalling involves complex cascades: multiple germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors rapidly recognize pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns to induce the production of cytokines, which bind to their corresponding receptors to orchestrate subsequent host defense phases. Inflammation is a healthy response to pathogenic signals, which are typically rapid and specific, and they terminate once the threat has passed. However, excessive activation or suppression of innate immune or inflammatory responses can lead to considerable human suffering, such as cardiac remodelling. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that innate immune molecules in the parenchymal cells of the heart influence cardiac homeostasis not only by directly regulating innate immune responses but also through reprogrammed signalling pathways, which are independent of conventional innate immune signalling. Elucidating 'innate immune signalling reprogramming' events will help us better understand the functions of innate immune molecules and, moreover, the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases.",

    "articleAbstract": "statin use over the age of 80 years is weakly evidence-based. This study aimed to estimate rates of statin inception and deprescribing by frailty level in people aged 80 years or older.a cohort of 212,566 participants aged ≥80 years was sampled from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Statin inception was defined as a first-ever prescription in a non-statin user; deprescribing was defined as a last ever statin prescription more than 6 months before the end of participant records. Rates were estimated in a time-to-event framework allowing for mortality as a competing risk. Co-variates were age, gender, frailty category and prevention type.prevalent statin use increased from 2001-5 (9.9%) to 2011-15 (49.3%). Inception of statins in never-users was low overall at 2.4% per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-2.6%) and declined with age. Deprescribing of statins in current users occurred at a rate of 5.6% (95% CI 5.4-5.9%) per year overall and increased with age, reaching 17.8% per year (95% CI 6.7-28.9%) among centenarians. Deprescribing was slightly higher for primary prevention (6.5% per year) than secondary prevention (5.2% per year) indications (P < 0.001). Deprescribing increased with frailty level being 5.0% per year in 'fit' participants and 7.1% in 'severe' frailty (P < 0.001).statin use has increased in the over 80s but deprescribing is common and increases with age and frailty level. These paradoxical findings highlight a need for better evidence to inform statin use and discontinuation for people aged ≥80 years.",

    "articleAbstract": "subjective cognitive concerns (SCC) have been proposed as a means of identifying individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the utility of SCCs has not been well-explored for African-Americans, who are twice as likely to develop AD dementia as Caucasians. We investigated whether race affects the association between SCCs and objective memory performance.we used a composite of three SCC questionnaires, and three challenging episodic memory tests. We studied 289 (61% female; African-American n = 47) clinically normal older individuals. Two hierarchical linear regressions assessed the modifying role of race on the association between SCC and objective memory performance. The first regression was conducted on the full sample, while the second matched the racial groups on age, estimated verbal IQ and socioeconomic status.in the full sample, both groups reported similar levels of SCCs, P = 0.10, although African-Americans performed worse on the memory tasks, P < 0.001. No group differences were observed in the matched sample. The SCC × race interaction term was nonsignificant in the full sample, β = 0.109, P = 0.09, but was significant in the matched sample, β = 0.422, P = 0.037. While a significant correlation was observed between SCCs and memory among Caucasians, r = -0.401, the correlation was not found among African-Americans, r = -0.052.results suggest that the dissociation between SCCs and memory performance in African-Americans may indicate qualitative differences in how diverse groups endorse cognitive concerns, even after considering socioeconomic and educational factors.",

    "articleAbstract": "The presynaptic, high-affinity choline transporter is a critical determinant of signalling by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at both central and peripheral cholinergic synapses, including the neuromuscular junction. Here we describe an autosomal recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome presenting with a broad clinical phenotype due to homozygous choline transporter missense mutations. The clinical phenotype ranges from the classical presentation of a congenital myasthenic syndrome in one patient (p.Pro210Leu), to severe neurodevelopmental delay with brain atrophy (p.Ser94Arg) and extend the clinical outcomes to a more severe spectrum with infantile lethality (p.Val112Glu). Cells transfected with mutant transporter construct revealed a virtually complete loss of transport activity that was paralleled by a reduction in transporter cell surface expression. Consistent with these findings, studies to determine the impact of gene mutations on the trafficking of the Caenorhabditis elegans choline transporter orthologue revealed deficits in transporter export to axons and nerve terminals. These findings contrast with our previous findings in autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy of a dominant-negative frameshift mutation at the C-terminus of choline transporter that was associated with significantly reduced, but not completely abrogated choline transporter function. Together our findings define divergent neuropathological outcomes arising from different classes of choline transporter mutation with distinct disease processes and modes of inheritance. These findings underscore the essential role played by the choline transporter in sustaining acetylcholine neurotransmission at both central and neuromuscular synapses, with important implications for treatment and drug selection.",

    "articleAbstract": "Neuroprosthetics research in amputee patients aims at developing new prostheses that move and feel like real limbs. Targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is such an approach and consists of rerouting motor and sensory nerves from the residual limb towards intact muscles and skin regions. Movement of the myoelectric prosthesis is enabled via decoded electromyography activity from reinnervated muscles and touch sensation on the missing limb is enabled by stimulation of the reinnervated skin areas. Here we ask whether and how motor control and redirected somatosensory stimulation provided via TMSR affected the maps of the upper limb in primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, as well as their functional connections. To this aim, we tested three TMSR patients and investigated the extent, strength, and topographical organization of the missing limb and several control body regions in M1 and S1 at ultra high-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, we analysed the functional connectivity between M1 and S1 and of both these regions with fronto-parietal regions, known to be important for multisensory upper limb processing. These data were compared with those of control amputee patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 12). We found that M1 maps of the amputated limb in TMSR patients were similar in terms of extent, strength, and topography to healthy controls and different from non-TMSR patients. S1 maps of TMSR patients were also more similar to normal conditions in terms of topographical organization and extent, as compared to non-targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation patients, but weaker in activation strength compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity in TMSR patients between upper limb maps in M1 and S1 was comparable with healthy controls, while being reduced in non-TMSR patients. However, connectivity was reduced between S1 and fronto-parietal regions, in both the TMSR and non-TMSR patients with respect to healthy controls. This was associated with the absence of a well-established multisensory effect (visual enhancement of touch) in TMSR patients. Collectively, these results show how M1 and S1 process signals related to movement and touch are enabled by targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation. Moreover, they suggest that TMSR may counteract maladaptive cortical plasticity typically found after limb loss, in M1, partially in S1, and in their mutual connectivity. The lack of multisensory interaction in the present data suggests that further engineering advances are necessary (e.g. the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prostheses) to enable prostheses that move and feel as real limbs.",

    "articleAbstract": "Motivational interviewing (MI) is a method for building motivation for behaviour change that has potential for use in respiratory contexts. There is a paucity of published research exploring the feasibility of this intervention from the clinicians' perspective. This study aimed to explore respiratory clinicians' views of MI: Is it perceived as useful? Could it be integrated into practice? What training would be required to make it part of routine care? Nine respiratory clinicians attended a one-day MI workshop and a semi-structured face-to-face interview two weeks later. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with thematic analysis. Four main themes are presented-1) MI's suitability for use in respiratory contexts: participants saw potential in using MI to motivate their patients to engage with prescribed respiratory interventions, such as increased physical activity. Those who experimented with new skills post-workshop were encouraged by patient responsiveness and outcomes. 2) MI's relationship with routine clinical practice: some believed they already used elements of MI, but most participants felt MI was fundamentally 'different' to their normal style of working. 3) Implementation issues: additional time would need to be made available to enable an appropriate depth of conversation. 4) Training issues: Participants sensed the complexity of MI could make it difficult to learn and that it would take them time to become competent. On-going supervision was perceived as necessary. One key challenge identified was how to suppress behaviours that are antithetical to MI. These findings lend support to the feasibility of using MI in respiratory contexts such as pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, but highlight implementation and training issues that would need to be overcome. The insights have informed the development of another study, testing the effect of a tailored training package on MI skill, specifically for respiratory clinicians delivering pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Despite the immense literature related to diverse human electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters, very few studies have focused on the reliability of these measures. Some of the most studied components (i.e., P3 or MMN) have received more attention regarding the stability of their main parameters, such as latency, amplitude or topography. However, spectral modulations have not been as extensively evaluated considering that different analysis methods are available. The main aim of the present study is to assess the reliability of the latency, amplitude and topography of event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the alpha band (10-14 Hz) observed in a cognitive task (visual oddball). Topography reliability was analysed at different levels (for the group, within-subjects individually and between-subjects individually).The latency for alpha ERD showed stable behaviour between two sessions, and the amplitude exhibited an increment (more negative) in the second session. Alpha ERD topography exhibited a high correlation score between sessions at the group level (r = 0.903, p<0.001). The mean value for within-subject correlations was 0.750 (with a range from 0.391 to 0.954). Regarding between-subject topography comparisons, some subjects showed a highly specific topography, whereas other subjects showed topographies that were more similar to those of other subjects.ERD was mainly stable between the two sessions with the exception of amplitude, which exhibited an increment in the second session. Topography exhibits excellent reliability at the group level; however, it exhibits highly heterogeneous behaviour at the individual level. Considering that the P3 was previously evaluated for this group of subjects, a direct comparison of the correlation scores was possible, and it showed that the ERD component is less reliable in individual topography than in the ERP component (P3).",

    "articleAbstract": "Liver-resident natural killer (NK) cells express TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a critical molecule for NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing. We previously reported that TRAIL expression in liver NK cells decreases markedly after hepatectomy; however, the mechanism underlying this drastic alteration remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the role of chemokine signaling in liver-resident NK cells during the perioperative period of hepatectomy. The expression levels of various chemokine receptors on liver-resident NK cells and their associations with TRAIL expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of various intrahepatic chemokines/cytokines was analyzed after 70% hepatectomy in mice by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We further investigated whether polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-induced NK cell activation could ameliorate TRAIL expression in the liver after 70% hepatectomy in CXCR3-/- and wild-type mice. TRAIL+ NK cells strongly and exclusively expressed CXCR3, and the expression of its ligand CXCL9 was significantly decreased in the liver after hepatectomy. The kinetics of hepatic CXCL9 expression resembled the changes in hepatic TRAIL+ NK cells after hepatectomy. Among liver-resident mononuclear cells, CXCL9 was predominantly secreted by macrophages in response to interferon-γ stimulation. Although the administration of poly I:C, an inducer of interferon-γ, increased hepatic CXCL9 levels in both CXCR3-/- and wild-type mice even after hepatectomy, only wild-type mice exhibited the recovery of TRAIL expression on NK cells. Partial hepatectomy remarkably reduced the proportion of TRAIL-expressing NK cells in the liver via the downregulation of the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis in mice. These findings extend our knowledge of the factors contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after hepatectomy.",

    "articleAbstract": "Copaifera oleoresin is one of the most used natural products in popular medicine all over the world. Among other effects (i.e., anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, microbicidal) one of the most well-known is its wound healing capacity. However, the mechanism by which the oleoresin presents its effect is still not clear. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the wound healing capacity of oleoresin obtained from Copaifera paupera, its mechanism of action and identify its major components. For these purposes, diabetic Swiss Webster mice were topically treated with oleoresin (100, 150 or 200 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days after an excision was performed in the back of the mice. Cytokines, wound retraction and histological evaluation were conducted at 3, 7 and 10 days (for cytokines); 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days (for wound retraction); and 7 and 14 days (for histological evaluation). Our data indicate that oleoresin significantly reduced production of MCP-1 and TNF-α at days 7 and 10 post-excision and increased IL-10 production at both days. All treatments demonstrated an effect similar or higher to that in collagenase-treated mice. Histological evaluations demonstrated that higher dose treatment resulted in better resolution and closure of the wound and higher levels of collagen deposition and indexes of re-epithelialization even when compared with the collagenase-treated group. The treatment with oleoresin from Copaifera paupera demonstrated that it is even better than an ointment routinely used for improvement of wound healing, suggesting this oleoresin as an option for use in diabetic patients.",

    "articleAbstract": "Idiopathic hypereosinophilia (IHE)/idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES) has been defined by a persistent elevation of the blood eosinophil count exceeding 1.5×103/μL, without evidence of reactive or clonal causes. While T-cell clonality assessment has been recommended for unexplained hypereosinophilia, this approach is not often applied to routine practice in the clinic. We hypothesized that the clonality would exist in a subset of IHE/IHES patients. We aimed to investigate the candidate mutations and T-cell clonality in IHE/IHES and to explore the role of mutations in eosinophil proliferation. We performed targeted capture sequencing for 88 genes using next-generation sequencing, T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement assays, and pathway network analysis in relation to eosinophil proliferation. By targeted sequencing, 140 variants in 59 genes were identified. Sixteen out of 30 patients (53.3%) harbored at least one candidate mutation. The most frequently affected genes were NOTCH1 (26.7%), SCRIB and STAG2 (16.7%), and SH2B3 (13.3%). Network analysis revealed that our 21 candidate genes (BIRC3, BRD4, CSF3R, DNMT3A, EGR2, EZH2, FAT4, FLT3, GATA2, IKZF, JAK2, MAPK1, MPL, NF1, NOTCH1, PTEN, RB1, RUNX1, TET2, TP53 and WT1) are functionally linked to the eosinophilopoietic pathway. Among the 21 candidate genes, five genes (MAPK1, RUNX1, GATA2, NOTCH1 and TP53) with the highest number of linkages were considered major genes. A TCR assay revealed that four patients (13.3%) had a clonal TCR rearrangement. NOTCH1 was the most frequently mutated gene and was shown to be a common node for eosinophilopoiesis in our network analysis, while the possibility of hidden T cell malignancy was indwelling in the presence of NOTCH1 mutation, though not revealed by aberrant T cell study. Collectively, these results provide new evidence that mutations affecting eosinophilopoiesis underlie a subset of IHE/IHES, and the candidate genes are inferred to act their potential roles in the eosinophilopoietic pathway.",

    "articleAbstract": "It is Ugandan governmental policy that all surgical care delivered at government hospitals in Uganda is to be provided to patients free of charge. In practice, however, frequent stock-outs and broken equipment require patients to pay for large portions of their care out of their own pocket. The purpose of this study was to determine the financial impact on patients who undergo surgery at a government hospital in Uganda.Every surgical patient discharged from a surgical ward at a large regional referral hospital in rural southwestern Uganda over a 3-week period in April 2016 was asked to participate. Patients who agreed were surveyed to determine their baseline level of poverty and to assess the financial impact of the hospitalization. Rates of impoverishment and catastrophic expenditure were then calculated. An \"impoverishing expense\" is defined as one that pushes a household below published poverty thresholds. A \"catastrophic expense\" was incurred if the patient spent more than 10% of their average annual expenditures.We interviewed 295 out of a possible 320 patients during the study period. 46% (CI 40-52%) of our patients met the World Bank's definition of extreme poverty ($1.90/person/day). After receiving surgical care an additional 10 patients faced extreme poverty, and 5 patients were newly impoverished by the World Bank's definition ($3.10/person/day). 31% of patients faced a catastrophic expenditure of more than 10% of their estimated total yearly expenses. 53% of the households in our study had to borrow money to pay for care, 21% had to sell possessions, and 17% lost a job as a result of the patient's hospitalization. Only 5% of our patients received some form of charity.Despite the government's policy to provide \"free care,\" undergoing an operation at a government hospital in Uganda can result in a severe economic burden to patients and their families. Alternative financing schemes to provide financial protection are critically needed.",

    "articleAbstract": "The mammalian retina harbors a circadian clockwork that regulates vision and promotes healthiness of retinal neurons, mainly through directing the rhythmic release of the neurohormones dopamine-acting on dopamine D4 receptors-and melatonin-acting on MT1 and MT2 receptors. The gene Gnaz-a unique Gi/o subfamily member-was seen in the present study to be expressed in photoreceptors where its protein product Gαz shows a daily rhythm in its subcellular localization. Apart from subcellular localization, Gnaz displays a daily rhythm in expression-with peak values at night-in preparations of the whole retina, microdissected photoreceptors and photoreceptor-related pinealocytes. In retina, Gnaz rhythmicity was observed to persist under constant darkness and to be abolished in retina deficient for Clock or dopamine D4 receptors. Furthermore, circadian regulation of Gnaz was disturbed in the db/db mouse, a model of diabetic retinopathy. The data of the present study suggest that Gnaz links the circadian clockwork-via dopamine acting on D4 receptors-to G protein-mediated signaling in intact but not diabetic retina.",

    "articleAbstract": "Panoramic views of natural environments provide visually navigating animals with two kinds of information: they define locations because image differences increase smoothly with distance from a reference location and they provide compass information, because image differences increase smoothly with rotation away from a reference orientation. The range over which a given reference image can provide navigational guidance (its 'catchment area') has to date been quantified from the perspective of walking animals by determining how image differences develop across the ground plane of natural habitats. However, to understand the information available to flying animals there is a need to characterize the 'catchment volumes' within which panoramic snapshots can provide navigational guidance. We used recently developed camera-based methods for constructing 3D models of natural environments and rendered panoramic views at defined locations within these models with the aim of mapping navigational information in three dimensions. We find that in relatively open woodland habitats, catchment volumes are surprisingly large extending for metres depending on the sensitivity of the viewer to image differences. The size and the shape of catchment volumes depend on the distance of visual features in the environment. Catchment volumes are smaller for reference images close to the ground and become larger for reference images at some distance from the ground and in more open environments. Interestingly, catchment volumes become smaller when only above horizon views are used and also when views include a 1 km distant panorama. We discuss the current limitations of mapping navigational information in natural environments and the relevance of our findings for our understanding of visual navigation in animals and autonomous robots.",

    "articleAbstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic progressive liver disease. AIH is composed predominantly of type 1 in Japanese populations. The genetic and environmental factors are associated with the pathogenesis of AIH. HLA-DRB1*03:01 and *04:01 are associated with type 1 AIH in European and *04:05 in Japanese populations. Here, we conducted an HLA association study in order to find HLA alleles or haplotypes predisposing or protective for Japanese AIH.HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 genotyping of 360 type 1 AIH patients and 1026 healthy controls was performed.The predisposing association of DRB1*04:01 (P = 0.0006, corrected P [Pc] = 0.0193, odds ratio [OR] 2.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62-5.43), DRB1*04:05 (P = 1.89×10-21, Pc = 5.86×10-20, OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.65-4.38), and DQB1*04:01 (P = 4.66×10-18, Pc = 6.99×10-17, OR 3.89, 95% CI 2.84-5.33) and the protective association of DRB1*13:02 (P = 0.0003, Pc = 0.0080, OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.72) with Japanese type 1 AIH were observed. An association of the DR4/DR8 heterozygous genotype with Japanese AIH was identified for the first time (P = 3.12×10-9, OR 3.52, 95% CI 2.34-5.29). Susceptible diplotypes were DRB1*04:05-DQB1*04:01/DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02 (P = 0.0004, OR 24.77, 95% CI 1.45-424.31) and DRB1*04:05-DQB1*04:01/DRB1*08:03-DQB1*06:01 (P = 1.18×10-6, OR 10.64, 95% CI 3.19-35.46). Serum levels of Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M, International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group score, positive rate of anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and the rate of definite AIH were higher in AIH patients with DRB1*04:05 than without.The important roles of specific combinations of DRB1 and DQB1 alleles or haplotypes in the pathogenesis of type 1 AIH were suggested. The association of DR4/DR8 heterozygous genotype suggested the pathologic importance of trans-complementing DQα-β heterodimer molecules encoded by DQA1 allele of one haplotype and the DQB1 allele of the other haplotype, as it was proposed in the HLA association studies of Type 1 diabetes.",

    "articleAbstract": "PI3K signaling is frequently dysregulated in NSCLC-SQCC. In contrast to well characterized components of the PI3K signaling network contributing to the formation of SQCC, potential oncogenic effects of alterations in PIK3C2B are poorly understood. Here, a large cohort (n = 362) of NSCLC-SQCC was selectively screened for four reported somatic mutations in PIK3C2B via Sanger sequencing. In addition, two mutations leading to an amino acid exchange in the kinase domain (C1181, H1208R) were examined on a functional level. None of the mutations were identified in the cohort while well characterized hotspot PIK3CA mutations were observed at the expected frequency. Ultimately, kinase domain mutations in PI3KC2β were found to have no altering effect on downstream signaling. A set of SQCC tumors sequenced by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) equally indicates a lack of oncogenic potential of the kinase domain mutations or PIK3C2B in general. Taken together, this study suggests that PIK3C2B might only have a minor role in SQCC oncogenesis.",

    "articleAbstract": "The outer membrane protein (Omp) A is a major constituent of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. This protein has been used in several vaccine development studies, but seldom with a view to vaccinating against mastitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the immunogenicity of E. coli OmpA and its vaccine potential for cows. Both the humoral and cellular immune responses were investigated. The gene for OmpA of the mastitis-causing strain P4 was cloned and expressed, and the recombinant protein (rEcOmpA) purified. Cows were immunized twice with rEcOmpA with adjuvant one month apart by the systemic route. Before immunization, few antibodies to rEcOmpA were detected, and there was little production of IL-17A in a whole blood stimulation assay (WBA) with rEcOmpA. Antibodies to rEcOmpA were induced by immunization. These antibodies were not able to react with E. coli P4, but reacted with a rough P4 mutant prepared by inactivating the rfb locus. This suggests that the complete LPS O-chain precluded the accessibility of antibodies to their target at the outer membrane. The cellular immune response appeared to be biased towards a Th17-type, as more IL-17A than IFN-γ was produced in the OmpA-specific WBA. There was a good correlation between antibody titers and the production of IL-17A in the WBA. The intramammary instillation of rEcOmpA elicited a slight local inflammatory response which was not related to the WBA. Overall, the interest of OmpA as vaccine immunogen was not established, although other experimental conditions (dose, adjuvant, route) need to be investigated to conclude definitively. The study pointed to several important issues such as the accessibility of OmpA to antibodies and the weakness of Th1-type response induced by OmpA.",

Considerable work has focused on LRPs in the fields of vascular biology and neurobiology. How these receptors affect cancer progression in humans remains largely unknown. Herein, we mined provisional databases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to compare expression of thirteen LRPs in ten common solid malignancies in patients. Our first goal was to determine the abundance of LRP mRNAs in each type of cancer. Our second goal was to determine whether expression of LRPs is associated with improved or worsened patient survival. In total, data from 4,629 patients were mined. In nine of ten cancers studied, the most abundantly expressed LRP was LRP1; however, a correlation between LRP1 mRNA expression and patient survival was observed only in bladder urothelial carcinoma. In this malignancy, high levels of LRP1 mRNA were associated with worsened patient survival. High levels of LDL receptor (LDLR) mRNA were associated with decreased patient survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. High levels of LRP10 mRNA were associated with decreased patient survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. LRP2 was the only LRP for which high levels of mRNA expression correlated with improved patient survival. This correlation was observed in renal clear cell carcinoma. Insights into LRP gene expression in human cancers and their effects on patient survival should guide future research.",

    "articleAbstract": "Besides inclusion in 1st line regimens against tuberculosis (TB), pyrazinamide (PZA) is used in 2nd line anti-TB regimens, including in the short regimen for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients. Guidelines and expert opinions are contradictory about inclusion of PZA in case of resistance. Moreover, drug susceptibility testing (DST) for PZA is not often applied in routine testing, and the prevalence of resistance is unknown in several regions, including in most African countries.Six hundred and twenty-three culture isolates from rifampicin-resistant (RR) patients were collected in twelve Sub-Saharan African countries. Among those isolates, 71% were from patients included in the study on the Union short-course regimen for MDR-TB in Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Niger, and Rwanda PZA resistance, and the rest (29%) were consecutive isolates systematically stored from 2014-2015 in Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo. Besides national guidelines, the isolates were tested for PZA resistance through pncA gene sequencing.Over half of these RR-TB isolates (54%) showed a mutation in the pncA gene, with a significant heterogeneity between countries. Isolates with fluoroquinolone resistance (but not with injectable resistance or XDR) were more likely to have concurrent PZA resistance. The pattern of mutations in the pncA gene was quite diverse, although some isolates with an identical pattern of mutations in pncA and other drug-related genes were isolated from the same reference center, suggesting possible transmission of these strains.Similar to findings in other regions, more than half of the patients having RR-TB in West and Central Africa present concomitant resistance to PZA. Further investigations are needed to understand the relation between resistance to PZA and resistance to fluoroquinolones, and whether continued use of PZA in the face of PZA resistance provides clinical benefit to the patients.",

    "articleAbstract": "Based on a set of subjects and a collection of attributes obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we used redescription mining to find interpretable rules revealing associations between those determinants that provide insights about the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We extended the CLUS-RM redescription mining algorithm to a constraint-based redescription mining (CBRM) setting, which enables several modes of targeted exploration of specific, user-constrained associations. Redescription mining enabled finding specific constructs of clinical and biological attributes that describe many groups of subjects of different size, homogeneity and levels of cognitive impairment. We confirmed some previously known findings. However, in some instances, as with the attributes: testosterone, ciliary neurotrophic factor, brain natriuretic peptide, Fas ligand, the imaging attribute Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD, as well as the levels of leptin and angiopoietin-2 in plasma, we corroborated previously debatable findings or provided additional information about these variables and their association with AD pathogenesis. Moreover, applying redescription mining on ADNI data resulted with the discovery of one largely unknown attribute: the Pregnancy-Associated Protein-A (PAPP-A), which we found highly associated with cognitive impairment in AD. Statistically significant correlations (p ≤ 0.01) were found between PAPP-A and clinical tests: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, Mini Mental State Examination, etc. The high importance of this finding lies in the fact that PAPP-A is a metalloproteinase, known to cleave insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. Since it also shares similar substrates with A Disintegrin and the Metalloproteinase family of enzymes that act as α-secretase to physiologically cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, it could be directly involved in the metabolism of APP very early during the disease course. Therefore, further studies should investigate the role of PAPP-A in the development of AD more thoroughly.",

Whether this applies to the subgroup of young patients with high risk DLBCL is not known. We previously found that in a uniform retrospective population-based cohort of patients aged 18-60 years with high-risk DLBCL, the addition of etoposide to R-CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOEP) resulted in improved survival mainly in patients with germinal center B-cell like (GCB) immunophenotype. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of DE and DH in this patient cohort.Data on all young Danish patients diagnosed with de novo high-risk DLBCL 2004-2008 and treated with R-CHOP or R-CHOEP were obtained from the Danish Lymphoma database (n = 159). Tumor samples were available from 103 patients. MYC and BCL2 proteins were analyzed with quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) using different cut off values. MYC-, BCL2- and BCL6-translocations were examined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).DE with MYC>75% and BCL2>85% was an independent negative prognostic marker of progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with R-CHOP but not R-CHOEP (p<0.001), also after exclusion of patients with DH. A predictive effect of DE for response (PFS) to R-CHOEP vs. R-CHOP was almost significant (p = 0.07). DH was not prognostic in this patient cohort.In young patients with high-risk DLBCL, treatment with R-CHOEP may overcome the negative prognostic impact of DE observed in patients treated with R-CHOP.",

    "articleAbstract": "Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone with many varied functions including regulation of blood calcium levels, cell proliferation, immunity, and reproduction in mammals. Vitamin D is activated by 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) and 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and is degraded by 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1). Vitamin D is transported by vitamin D-binding protein (group-specific component, GC) through the bloodstream and regulates cellular actions by binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR). In this study, we determined the expression and regulation of vitamin D-related molecules and the role of vitamin D at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs. Vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes CYP2R1, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1, vitamin D binding protein GC, and vitamin D receptor VDR were expressed in the endometrium in a pregnancy stage-specific manner as well as in conceptus and chorioallantoic tissues during pregnancy. VDR protein was localized to endometrial and trophoblastic cells. Concentrations of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, in the endometrial tissues were higher during early pregnancy than in mid- to late pregnancy, while plasma concentrations of calcitriol were highest during late pregnancy. Furthermore, calcitriol affected the expression of several genes related to conceptus implantation, vitamin D metabolism, calcium ion regulation, PG metabolism, and calcium-binding proteins in endometrial tissue explants. These results show that CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, GC, and VDR were expressed at the maternal-conceptus interface, endometrial calcitriol levels were regulated during pregnancy, and calcitriol modulated the expression of endometrial genes, suggesting that calcitriol may play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy by regulating endometrial function in pigs.",

    "articleAbstract": "Influenza is associated with highly contagious respiratory infections. Previous research has found that influenza transmission is often associated with climate variables especially in temperate regions. This study was performed in order to fill the gap of knowledge regarding the relationship between incidence of influenza and three meteorological parameters (temperature, rainfall and humidity) in a tropical setting. This was a retrospective study performed in Yaoundé-Cameroon from January 2009 to November 2015. Weekly proportions of confirmed influenza cases from five sentinel sites were considered as dependent variables, whereas weekly values of mean temperature, average relative humidity and accumulated rainfall were considered as independent variables. A univariate linear regression model was used in determining associations between influenza activity and weather covariates. A time-series method was used to predict on future values of influenza activity. The data was divided into 2 parts; the first 71 months were used to calibrate the model, and the last 12 months to test for prediction. Overall, there were 1173 confirmed infections with influenza virus. Linear regression analysis showed that there was no statistically significant association observed between influenza activity and weather variables. Very weak relationships (-0.1 < r < 0.1) were observed. Three prediction models were obtained for the different viral types (overall positive, Influenza A and Influenza B). Model 1 (overall influenza) and model 2 (influenza A) fitted well during the estimation period; however, they did not succeed to make good forecasts for predictions. Accumulated rainfall was the only external covariate that enabled good fit of both models. Based on the stationary R2, 29.5% and 41.1% of the variation in the series can be explained by model 1 and 2, respectively. This study laid more emphasis on the fact that influenza in Cameroon is characterized by year-round activity. The meteorological variables selected in this study did not enable good forecast of future influenza activity and certainly acted as proxies to other factors not considered, such as, UV radiation, absolute humidity, air quality and wind.",

The false positive rate was determined in consecutive patients with negative culture results. A positive dipstick was a test result with a trace leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite positivity. Bacteriuria was the growth of at least 105 colony-forming units per milliliter of urine.Of 20,555 consecutive patients, 228 had a bacteremic UTI, and 4069 a negative culture result. The sensitivity of the dipstick was 96.9% (95% CI-93.7-98.6) with a false positive rate of 42.4% (95% CI, 41.0-43.8) in those with a negative culture result.In elderly hospitalized patients with a bacteremic UTI, the dipstick urinalysis is highly sensitive, much higher than reported previously in studies of UTIs in the elderly. It is unclear whether the observed high sensitivity of the dipstick was due to the exclusion of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria or to spectrum bias. Studies of the clinical utility/disutility of using a negative dipstick to rule out a urinary tract infection are warranted.",

    "articleAbstract": "Wing morphology strongly affects flight performance which may consequently decline during feather moult due to the creation of feather gaps in the wing. Hence, the size and shape of moult-related wing gap may directly affect flight capacity. Here I examined the rare divergent primary moult sequence compared to the more common descendant moult sequence. In the divergent moult, the focus of primary moult is shifted from P1 (primary feather numbered descendantly) to another primary between P2 and P5, and then primaries are moulted in two concurrent waves, one descendant and the other ascendant. The result of this rare moult sequence is the splitting of the wing gap to two smaller gaps. Using a large moult database including 6,763 individuals of 32 Western Palaearctic passerine species, I found evidence of divergent moult only among 27 individuals of 12 species. I examined the speed of wing-feather moult for each individual that moulted divergently compared to a control group of individuals at the same moult stage which moulted following the common descending sequence. The results indicate that the sequence of primary moult and moult speed are correlated. Individuals which moulted divergently moulted their primaries with higher moult speed than descendant moulters. The applicability of this study is weakened by the dearth of moult data, thus making it difficult to draw conclusions for a large range of species. Ornithologists and bird ringers are therefore encouraged to collect more basic moult data during their field study.",

    "articleAbstract": "Hemorrhagic meningitis is considered a complication of anthrax and was reported in about 50% of deadly cases in humans and non-human primates (NHP). Recently we demonstrated in Guinea pigs and rabbits that 100% of the B. anthracis-infected animals presented histopathology of meningitis at the time of death, some without any sign of hemorrhage. A similar pathology was observed in animals that succumbed following infection with the toxin deficient mutant, thus indicating that anthrax meningitis is a toxin-independent phenomenon. In this manuscript we describe a histopathological study of the B. anthracis infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Though we could find sporadic growth of the bacteria around blood vessels in the cortex, we report that the main infiltration route is the choroid plexus. We found massive destruction of entire sections of the choroid plexus coupled with massive aggregation of bacilli in the ventricles, in close proximity to the parenchyma. The choroid plexus also contained significant amounts of intravascular bacterial aggregates, often enclosed in what appear to be fibrin-like clots. The high concentration of these aggregates in areas of significant tissue destruction combined with the fact that capsular B. anthracis bacteria have a low tendency to adhere to endothelial cells, might suggest that these clots are used as an adherence mechanism by the bacteria. The major histopathological finding is meningitis. We find massive bacterial growth in the meninges without evidence of encephalitis, even when the bacteria emerge from a parenchymal blood vessel. Erythrocytes were present within the meningeal space but no clear vasculitis could be detected. Histology of the brain stem indicates meningitis, edema and hemorrhages that might explain death from suffocation due to direct damage to the respiratory center. All of these processes are toxin-independent, since they were observed following infection with either the wild type strain or the toxin-deficient mutant. Herein, we propose that the first step of anthrax-meningitis is bacterial adhesion to the blood vessels by manipulating coagulation, mainly in the choroid plexus. The trapped bacteria then destroy sections of the choroid plexus, resulting in penetration into the CSF, leading to meningitis and hemorrhage. Death could be the result of increased intracranial pressure and/or damage to the brain stem.",

    "articleAbstract": "Different subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have distinct sites of origin, histologies, genetic and epigenetic changes. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of ECT2 dysregulation and compared its prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In addition, we also investigated the enrichment of ECT2 co-expressed genes in KEGG pathways in LUAD and LUSC. Bioinformatic analysis was performed based on data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC. Results showed that ECT2 expression was significantly upregulated in both LUAD and LUSC compared with normal lung tissues. ECT2 expression was considerably higher in LUSC than in LUAD. The level of ECT2 DNA methylation was significantly lower in LUSC than in LUAD. ECT2 mutation was observed in 5% of LUAD and in 51% of LUSC cases. Amplification was the predominant alteration. LUAD patients with ECT2 amplification had significantly worse disease-free survival (p = 0.022). High ECT2 expression was associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) (p<0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.001) in LUAD patients. Nevertheless, these associations were not observed in patients with LUSC. The following univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the high ECT2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor OS (HR: 2.039, 95%CI: 1.457-2.852, p<0.001) and RFS (HR: 1.715, 95%CI: 1.210-2.432, p = 0.002) in LUAD patients, but not in LUSC patients. Among 518 genes co-expressed with ECT2 in LUAD and 386 genes co-expressed with ECT2 in LUSC, there were only 98 genes in the overlapping cluster. Some of the genes related KEGG pathways in LUAD were not observed in LUSC. These differences might help to explain the different prognostic value of ECT2 in LUAD and LUSC, which are also worthy of further studies.",

    "articleAbstract": "The efficient delivery of cellular cargo relies on the fusion of cargo-carrying vesicles with the correct membrane at the correct time. These spatiotemporal fusion events occur when SNARE proteins on the vesicle interact with cognate SNARE proteins on the target membrane. Regulatory Munc18 proteins are thought to contribute to SNARE interaction specificity through interaction with the SNARE protein Syntaxin. Neuronal Munc18a interacts with Syntaxin1 but not Syntaxin4, and adipocyte Munc18c interacts with Syntaxin4 but not Syntaxin1. Here we show that this accepted view of specificity needs revision. We find that Munc18c interacts with both Syntaxin4 and Syntaxin1, and appears to bind \"non-cognate\" Syntaxin1 a little more tightly than Syntaxin4. Munc18a binds Syntaxin1 and Syntaxin4, though it interacts with its cognate Syntaxin1 much more tightly. We also observed that when bound to non-cognate Munc18c, Syntaxin1 captures its neuronal SNARE partners SNAP25 and VAMP2, and Munc18c can bind to pre-formed neuronal SNARE ternary complex. These findings reveal that Munc18a and Munc18c bind Syntaxins differently. Munc18c relies principally on the Syntaxin N-peptide interaction for binding Syntaxin4 or Syntaxin1, whereas Munc18a can bind Syntaxin1 tightly whether or not the Syntaxin1 N-peptide is present. We conclude that Munc18a and Munc18c differ in their binding interactions with Syntaxins: Munc18a has two tight binding modes/sites for Syntaxins as defined previously but Munc18c has just one that requires the N-peptide. These results indicate that the interactions between Munc18 and Syntaxin proteins, and the consequences for in vivo function, are more complex than can be accounted for by binding specificity alone.",

The experience of fatigue in pSS, and its relationship with sicca symptoms, is poorly understood.Twenty people diagnosed with pSS were recruited to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview about their symptoms experience. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.People with pSS described physical tiredness, mental fatigue and ocular fatigue. Mental fatigue was characterised by difficulties in attention, particularly, the ability to follow conversations and short-term memory problems. Participants linked their experience of fatigue to feeling of depression, frustration, irritation and anxiety, and therefore, fatigue was suggested to have had a large impact on their psychological well-being. People with pSS also described a range of ocular symptoms including pain, dryness, and itching, which were compounded by fatigue. For some, eye fatigue was pervasive, and daily activities involving the eyes such as reading, using the computer and driving were impaired. In some cases, the level of ocular discomfort was so severe it prevented sleep, which in turn impacted on general fatigue levels.People with pSS experience fatigue in a range of ways; physical, mental and ocular fatigue were described. Fatigue was suggested to exacerbate other ocular symptoms, posed serious physical limitations and caused psychological distress. Further research into the nature of fatigue and ocular symptoms in pSS is required.",

    "articleAbstract": "Despite an exponential growth in research on mindfulness-based interventions, the body of scientific evidence supporting these treatments has been criticized for being of poor methodological quality.The current systematic review examined the extent to which mindfulness research demonstrated increased rigor over the past 16 years regarding six methodological features that have been highlighted as areas for improvement. These feature included using active control conditions, larger sample sizes, longer follow-up assessment, treatment fidelity assessment, and reporting of instructor training and intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses.We searched PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science in addition to a publically available repository of mindfulness studies.Randomized clinical trials of mindfulness-based interventions for samples with a clinical disorder or elevated symptoms of a clinical disorder listed on the American Psychological Association's list of disorders with recognized evidence-based treatment.Independent raters screened 9,067 titles and abstracts, with 303 full text reviews. Of these, 171 were included, representing 142 non-overlapping samples.Across the 142 studies published between 2000 and 2016, there was no evidence for increases in any study quality indicator, although changes were generally in the direction of improved quality. When restricting the sample to those conducted in Europe and North America (continents with the longest history of scientific research in this area), an increase in reporting of ITT analyses was found. When excluding an early, high-quality study, improvements were seen in sample size, treatment fidelity assessment, and reporting of ITT analyses.Taken together, the findings suggest modest adoption of the recommendations for methodological improvement voiced repeatedly in the literature. Possible explanations for this and implications for interpreting this body of research and conducting future studies are discussed.",

    "articleAbstract": "Understanding the referent of other's utterance by referring the contextual information helps in smooth communication. Although this pragmatic referential process can be observed even in infants, its underlying mechanism and relative abilities remain unclear. This study aimed to comprehend the background of the referential process by investigating whether the phonological loop affected the referent assignment. A total of 76 children (43 girls) aged 3-5 years participated in a reference assignment task in which an experimenter asked them to answer explicit (e.g., \"What color is this?\") and ambiguous (e.g., \"What about this?\") questions about colorful objects. The phonological loop capacity was measured by using the forward digit span task in which children were required to repeat the numbers as an experimenter uttered them. The results showed that the scores of the forward digit span task positively predicted correct response to explicit questions and part of the ambiguous questions. That is, the phonological loop capacity did not have effects on referent assignment in response to ambiguous questions that were asked after a topic shift of the explicit questions and thus required a backward reference to the preceding explicit questions to detect the intent of the current ambiguous questions. These results suggest that although the phonological loop capacity could overtly enhance the storage of verbal information, it does not seem to directly contribute to the pragmatic referential process, which might require further social cognitive processes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Adenocarcinoma of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a severe disease. Patients carrying EGFR mutations may benefit from EGFR targeted therapies (e.g.: gefitinib). Recently, it has been shown that sialidase NEU3 directly interacts and regulates EGFR. In this work, we investigate the effect of sialidase NEU3 overexpression on EGFR pathways activation and EGFR targeted therapies sensitivity, in a series of lung cancer cell lines. NEU3 overexpression, forced after transfection, does not affect NSCLC cell viability. We demonstrate that NEU3 overexpression stimulates the ERK pathway but this activation is completely abolished by gefitinib treatment. The Akt pathway is also hyper-activated upon NEU3 overexpression, but gefitinib is able only to decrease, and not to abolish, such activation. These findings indicate that NEU3 can act directly on the ERK pathway through EGFR and both directly and indirectly with respect to EGFR on the Akt pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a healthy mucosa cell line (with EGFR wild-type gene sequence) is slightly sensitive to gefitinib, especially in the presence of NEU3 overexpression, thus hypothesizing that NEU3 overexpressing patients may benefit from EGFR targeted therapies also in absence of EGFR point mutations. Overall, the expression of NEU3 may be a novel diagnostic marker in NSCLC because, by its ability to stimulate EGFR downstream pathways with direct and indirect mechanisms, it may help in the identification of patients who can profit from EGFR targeted therapies in absence of EGFR activating mutations or from new combinations of EGFR and Akt inhibitors.",

    "articleAbstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the importance of local environmental factors to determine the fine-scale heterogeneity of malaria transmission and exposure to the vector. In this work, we compare a classical GLM model with backward selection with different versions of an automatic LASSO-based algorithm with 2-level cross-validation aiming to build a predictive model of the space and time dependent individual exposure to the malaria vector, using entomological and environmental data from a cohort study in Benin. Although the GLM can outperform the LASSO model with appropriate engineering, the best model in terms of predictive power was found to be the LASSO-based model. Our approach can be adapted to different topics and may therefore be helpful to address prediction issues in other health sciences domains.",

    "articleAbstract": "Laboratory mice play a tremendous role in biomedical research in studies on immunology, infection, cancer and therapy. In the course of standardization of mice used in animal experiments, health monitoring constitutes an important instrument towards microbiological standardization. Infections with murine astroviruses (MuAstV) were only recently discovered and are, therefore, still relatively unknown in laboratory animal science. In rodent health monitoring viral infections within a population are commonly assessed in terms of specific antibodies by serological testing, as active infection and excretion of virus is often temporary and can easily be missed. So far only ongoing infections with astroviruses can be detected by PCR. The objective of this work was the development of a sensitive and specific MuAstV multiplex serological assay with a high-throughput capability to be used in routine testing of laboratory mice. Four different MuAstV proteins were recombinantly expressed and used as antigens. The best reacting antigen, the capsid spike protein VP27, was selected and tested with a panel of 400 sera of mice from units with a known MuAstV status. Assay sensitivity and specificity resulted in 98.5% and 100%, respectively, compared to RT-PCR results. Eventually this assay was used to test 5529 serum samples in total, during routine diagnostics at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg between 2015 and 2017. High sero-prevalence rates of up to 98% were detected in units with open cages indicating that the virus is highly infectious and circulates within these populations virtually infecting all animals regardless of the mouse strain. In addition, data collected from 312 mice purchased from commercial breeders and from 661 mice from 58 research institutes in 15 countries worldwide allowed the conclusion that MuAstV is widespread in contemporary laboratory mouse populations.",

    "articleAbstract": "Analysis of in-shoe pressure distribution during sport-specific movements may provide a clue to improve shoe design and prevent injuries. This study compared the mean and the peak pressures over the whole foot and ten separate areas of the foot, wearing different shoes during specific movements.Nine male adult recreational futsal players performed three trials of three sport-specific movements (shuffle, sprint and penalty kick), while they were wearing three brands of futsal shoes (Adidas, Lotto and Tiger). Plantar pressures on dominant feet were collected using the F-SCAN system. Peak and mean pressures for whole foot and each separate area were extracted. For statistical analysis, the mean differences in outcome variables between different shoes and movements were estimated using random-effects regression model using STATA ver.10.In the average calculation of the three movements, the peak pressure on the whole foot in Adidas shoe was less than Lotto [8.8% (CI95%: 4.1-13.6%)] and Tiger shoes [11.8% (CI95%:7-16.7%)], (P<0.001). Also, the recorded peak pressure on the whole foot in penalty kick was 61.1% (CI95%: 56.3-65.9%) and 57.6% (CI95%: 52.8-62.3%) less than Shuffle and Sprint tests, respectively (P<0.001).Areas with the highest peak pressure during all 3 movements were not different between all shoes. This area was medial forefoot in cases of shuffle and sprint movements and medial heel in case of penalty kick.",

    "articleAbstract": "Endocavitary ultrasound probes are part of a commonly used procedure in the clinical arena. The cavities examined, vaginal canal and cervix, anal canal, and oral cavity are all areas commonly infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV), thus making them susceptible to contamination by HPV. It has been demonstrated that these probes can remain contaminated with high-risk HPV even when approved disinfection protocols have been performed. we have previously shown that HPV is resistant to some high-level disinfectant (HLD). In our present study we analyzed efficacy of using high-level ultra-violet C (UVC) radiation against HPV16 and HPV18 using a hard-surface carrier test. Stocks of infectious authentic HPV16 and HPV18 virions were dried onto carriers with a 5% (v/v) protein soil or 4ppm hard water. Efficacy testing were performed with the automated device, Antigermix S1 device (UVC radiation at 253.7nm) and 0.55% OPA in quadruplicate with matched input, neutralization, and cytotoxicity controls. Hypochlorite was included as a positive control for viral deactivation. Infectivity was determined by the abundance (qRT-PCR) of the spliced E1^E4 transcript in infected recipient cells. The automated Antigermix S1 device showed excellent efficacy against HPV16 and HPV18 whereas OPA showed minimal efficacy. While HPV is highly resistant to OPA, high-level UVC radiation offers an effective disinfection practice for ultrasound probes. Our results suggest that healthcare facilities using endocavitary ultrasound probes need to strongly consider disinfection methods that are effective against HPV.",

However, very few studies have investigated the role played by insomnia and its components, and no data are available for a population of occupational drivers at risk, such as the truck driver category.To measure the prevalence and impact of insomnia on motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and near-miss accidents (NMAs) in 949 truck drivers.Cross-sectional survey.Insomnia affected 27.5% of the sample. Compared to other drivers, in the 3 years prior to the study, truck drivers with insomnia had reported a significantly higher number of MVAs; they had also reported a greater number of NMAs in the previous 6 months. After correction for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, short sleep duration, and other concurrent diseases, insomniac truck drivers had an almost two-fold risk of driving accidents (OR: 1.82, CI 95%:1.33-2.49) and a more than three-fold increased risk of near-miss accidents (OR: 3.35, CI95%:2.06-5.45) compared to non-insomniac drivers.Insomnia emerged as an independent risk factor for MVAs and NMAs. We strongly advise screening commercial drivers for signs and symptoms of insomnia in order to improve health and safety on the road.",

    "articleAbstract": "Recent developments in high throughput genomic assays have opened up the possibility of testing hundreds and thousands of genes simultaneously. However, adhering to the regular statistical assumptions regarding the null distributions of test statistics in such large-scale multiple testing frameworks has the potential of leading to incorrect significance testing results and biased inference. This problem gets worse when one combines results from different independent genomic experiments with a possibility of ending up with gross false discoveries of significant genes. In this article, we develop a meta-analysis method of combining p-values from different independent experiments involving large-scale multiple testing frameworks, through empirical adjustments of the individual test statistics and p-values. Even though, it is based on various existing ideas, this specific combination is novel and potentially useful. Through simulation studies and real genomic datasets we show that our method outperforms the standard meta-analysis approach of significance testing in terms of accurately identifying the truly significant set of genes.",

Despite consensus that drug efficacies should be monitored for signs of decline that could jeopardise the effectiveness of PCT, systematic monitoring and evaluation is seldom implemented. Drug trials mostly report aggregate efficacies in groups of participants, but heterogeneities in design complicate classical meta-analyses of these data. Individual participant data (IPD) permit more detailed analysis of drug efficacies, offering increased sensitivity to identify atypical responses potentially caused by emerging drug resistance.We performed a systematic literature review to identify studies concluding after 2000 that collected IPD suitable for estimating drug efficacy against STH. We included studies that administered a variety of anthelmintics with follow ups less than 60 days after treatment. We estimated the number of IPD and extracted cohort- and study-level meta-data.We estimate that there exist individual data on approximately 35,000 participants from 129 studies conducted in 39 countries, including 34 out of 103 countries where PCT is recommended. We find significant heterogeneity in diagnostic methods, times of outcome assessment, and the reported measure of efficacy. We also quantify cohorts comprising pre-school age children, pregnant women, and co-infected participants, including with HIV.We argue that establishing a global IPD repository would improve the capacity to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs, respond to changes and safeguard the ongoing effectiveness of PCT. Establishing a fair, transparent data governance policy will be key for the engagement of the global STH community.",

    "articleAbstract": "Many populations collapse suddenly when reaching low densities even if they have abundant food conditions, a phenomenon known as an Allee effect. Such collapses can have disastrous consequences, for example, for loss of biodiversity. In this paper, we formulate a stage-structured consumer-resource biomass model in which adults only reproduce at the beginning of each growing season, and investigate the effect of an increasing stage-independent background mortality rate of the consumer. As the main difference with previously studied continuous-time models, seasonal reproduction can result in an Allee effect and consumer population collapses at high consumer mortality rate. However, unlike the mechanisms reported in the literature, in our model the Allee effect results from the time difference between the maturation of juveniles and the reproduction of adults. The timing of maturation plays a crucial role because it not only determines the body size of the individuals at maturation but also influences the duration of the period during which adults can invest in reproductive energy, which together determine the reproductive output at the end of the season. We suggest that there exists an optimal timing of maturation and that consumer persistence is promoted if individuals mature later in the season at a larger body size, rather than maturing early, despite high food availability supporting rapid growth.",

We investigated use of a modified parasternal mid right-ventricular (MRV) and right ventricle (RV) outflow (RVOT) view, in assessing RV size and function, and the suitability of advanced 2D-strain analysis. 15 WKY rats were examined using transthoracic echocardiography. The left heart was assessed using standard short and long axis views. For the right ventricle a MRV and RVOT view were used to measure RV chamber and free wall area. 2D-strain analysis was applied to both ventricles using off-line analysis. RV chamber volume was determined by injection of 2% agarose gel, and RV free wall dissected and weighed. Echocardiography measurement was correlated with necropsy findings. The RV mid-ventricular dimension (R1) was 0.42±0.07cm and the right ventricular outflow tract dimension (R2) was 0.34±0.06cm, chamber end-diastolic area measurements were 0.38±0.09cm2 and 0.29±0.08cm2 for MRV and RVOT views respectively. RVOT and MRV chamber area correlated with gel mass. Doppler RV stroke volume was 0.32±0.08ml, cardiac output (CO) 110±27 ml.min-1 and RV free wall contractility assessed using 2D-strain analysis was demonstrated. We have shown that modified MRV and RVOT views can provide detailed assessment of the RV in rodents, with 2D-strain analysis of the RV free wall potentially feasible.",

    "articleAbstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and premature coronary artery disease (CAD), remains mostly underdiagnosed and undertreated. We investigated the prevalence of clinical FH among Chinese patients with premature ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and one-year follow-up on their lipid management and cardiovascular events.Four hundred and ninety-eight premature STEMI patients (363men) were enrolled. FH patients were identified using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria. Lipid management and cardiovascular events in all patients were assessed.Nineteen patients (3.8%) were diagnosed as definite/probable FH, 211 (42.4%) as possible FH and 268 (53.8%) as unlikely FH. All patients were divided into two main groups: unlikely FH (0-2 points) and possible FH (≥3 points). Possible FH patients were younger (50.1 years vs. 53.5 years) with higher NT-proBNP level (3014.15 pg/mL vs. 2326.25 pg/mL), occurrence of multi-vessel CAD (37.4% vs. 18.3%), lower LVEF (47% vs. 49%) and more severe Killip classification (Class 3, 20.0% vs. 9.7%). Follow-up data were available for 203 patients from the possible FH group and 243 patients from the unlikely FH group. High intensity statin intake status (%) of possible FH vs. unlikely FH was as follows: 1) on admission: 4.8% vs. 0.4%; 2) at discharge: 10.4% vs. 1.6% and 3) at one year follow-up: 5.4% vs. 0.8%. A significantly low percentage of possible FH patients (18.7% vs. 51.4%) achieved target LDL-C levels. There were no significant differences in MACE defined as a composite of cardiogenic shock or Class IV heart failure, recurrent MI, cardiovascular-related rehospitalization, TLR and CV death between the two groups. However, the proportion of cardiogenic shock or Class IV heart failure was significantly higher in possible FH patients group (5.9% vs.1.2%).Clinical diagnosis of possible FH is common in Chinese patients with premature STEMI. A low proportion of FH patients were prescribed high intensity statins. Despite aggressive cholesterol-lowering drugs, a significantly lower proportion of FH patients achieved LDL-C targets compared to unlikely FH patients. Possible FH patients were younger with a significantly higher occurrence of multi-vessel CAD and impaired cardiac function.",

    "articleAbstract": "Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is the most common childhood cancer in equatorial Africa, and is endemic to areas where people are chronically co-infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. The contribution of these pathogens in the oncogenic process remains poorly understood. We showed earlier that the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 by hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by P. falciparum, suppresses the lytic reactivation of EBV in BL cells. EBV lytic reactivation is regulated by the expression of transcription factor Zta (ZEBRA), encoded by the EBV gene BZLF1. Here, we explore in the BL cell line Akata, the mechanism involved in repression by TLR9 of expression of BZLF1. We show that BZLF1 repression is mediated upon TLR9 engagement by a mechanism that is largely independent of de novo protein synthesis. By CRISPR/Cas9-induced inactivation of TLR9, MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK1 we confirm that BZLF1 repression is dependent on functional TLR9 and MyD88 signaling, and identify IRAK4 as an essential element for TLR9-induced repression of BZLF1 expression upon BCR cross-linking. Our results unprecedentedly show that TLR9-mediated inhibition of lytic EBV is largely independent of new protein synthesis and demonstrate the central roles of MyD88 and IRAK4 in this process contributing to EBV's persistence in the host's B-cell pool.",

    "articleAbstract": "Current approaches to building efficiency diagnoses include conventional energy audit techniques that can be expensive and time consuming. In contrast, virtual energy audits of readily available 15-minute-interval building electricity consumption are being explored to provide quick, inexpensive, and useful insights into building operation characteristics. A cross sectional analysis of six buildings in two different climate zones provides methods for data cleaning, population-based building comparisons, and relationships (correlations) of weather and electricity consumption. Data cleaning methods have been developed to categorize and appropriately filter or correct anomalous data including outliers, missing data, and erroneous values (resulting in < 0.5% anomalies). The utility of a cross-sectional analysis of a sample set of building's electricity consumption is found through comparisons of baseload, daily consumption variance, and energy use intensity. Correlations of weather and electricity consumption 15-minute interval datasets show important relationships for the heating and cooling seasons using computed correlations of a Time-Specific-Averaged-Ordered Variable (exterior temperature) and corresponding averaged variables (electricity consumption)(TSAOV method). The TSAOV method is unique as it introduces time of day as a third variable while also minimizing randomness in both correlated variables through averaging. This study found that many of the pair-wise linear correlation analyses lacked strong relationships, prompting the development of the new TSAOV method to uncover the causal relationship between electricity and weather. We conclude that a combination of varied HVAC system operations, building thermal mass, plug load use, and building set point temperatures are likely responsible for the poor correlations in the prior studies, while the correlation of time-specific-averaged-ordered temperature and corresponding averaged variables method developed herein adequately accounts for these issues and enables discovery of strong linear pair-wise correlation R values. TSAOV correlations lay the foundation for a new approach to building studies, that mitigates plug load interferences and identifies more accurate insights into weather-energy relationship for all building types. Over all six buildings analyzed the TSAOV method reported very significant average correlations per building of 0.94 to 0.82 in magnitude. Our rigorous statistics-based methods applied to 15-minute-interval electricity data further enables virtual energy audits of buildings to quickly and inexpensively inform energy savings measures.",

    "articleAbstract": "RecA plays key roles in DNA recombination, replication and repair. Mutation of recA in the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, fails to produce some of the phenotypes expected from study of recA mutation in other organisms. 'Missing' recA phenotypes include a lack of growth or viability effects, including in the presence of DNA damage, and a lack of a role in vlsE antigenic variation and infectivity. We present a purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant B. burgdorferi RecA protein. We find that B. burgdorferi RecA displays the expected properties of being a DNA-dependent ATPase, of having an intrinsic binding preference for ssDNA over dsDNA enhanced by ATP binding, of promoting DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions and of having a detectable coprotease activity with E. coli LexA repressor. DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions promoted by B. burgdorferi RecA show an unusually strong dependence upon the presence of the cognate ssDNA binding protein (SSB) but are very sensitive to inhibition by SSB when the ssDNA was prebound by SSB. This indicates B. burgdorferi RecA may have an enhanced requirement for recombinational mediators to promote RecA-SSB exchange, despite the absence of homologues of the RecF pathway proteins that normally play this role in eubacteria. Finally, we do not find any unusual, intrinsic properties of B. burgdorferi's RecA protein to explain the unusual phenotype of recA mutation and suggest that there may be alternative recombinase functions that could explain the 'missing' phenotypes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Underlying mechanisms contributing to the imbalance in bone turnover during osteoporosis remain only partially explained. Reduced sensory nerve function may contribute to this imbalance, as sensory neuropeptides affect the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vivo, especially during bone adaptation. In this study, we investigated bone adaptation in mice following two weeks of tibial compression (peak magnitude 3 N or 7 N). To induce decreased sensory nerve function, mice were treated with capsaicin as neonates. We hypothesized that decreased sensory nerve function would diminish the adaptation of bone to mechanical loading, assessed with μCT and dynamic histomorphometry. We found that tibial compression induced significant changes in cortical microarchitecture that depended on compression magnitude and location along the length of the tibia; in contrast, there was no effect of loading on trabecular bone of the tibial metaphysis. Tibial compression significantly increased periosteal, and decreased endosteal, bone formation. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, capsaicin-treated mice generally displayed a similar, if not larger, adaptive response to mechanical loading, including greater increases in bone mineral content and mineral apposition rate. To integrate mechanical loading of bone with sensory nerve activation, we examined whether concentration of the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in bone were affected following 1 or 5 days of 5 N tibial compression or hindlimb unloading. We found that 1 day of tibial compression significantly increased CGRP concentrations in bone, and hindlimb unloading also exhibited a trend toward increased CGRP in bone. These results may suggest a role of sensory nerves in the bone adaptation response to the mechanical environment, though this remains unclear.",

    "articleAbstract": "This study aimed to explore an evidence-based nursing practice model of CRF management in hospitalized adult patients using the PARIHS evidence-implementation framework as the theoretical structure to provide guidance for similar nursing practices. The implementation of guideline evidence into clinical practice was conducted on the oncology and radiotherapy wards of a university-affiliated hospital. The process of integrating the guideline into the symptom management system of cancer patients was described. The impact of the evidence implementation was evaluated from three aspects: organizational innovations and outcome measures associated with nurses and with patients pre- and post-evidence implementation. During the implementation of evidence into practice on the wards, a nursing process, health education, a quality control sheet and CRF training courses were established. Through this implementation, compliance with evidence related to CRF increased significantly on the two wards, with that of ward B being higher than that of ward A. Regarding nursing outcomes, nursing knowledge, attitude and behavior scores with respect to CRF nursing care increased substantially after its application on the two wards, and the ward B nurses' scoring was higher than that of the ward A nurses. Qualitative analysis concerning the nurses suggested that leadership, patient concern about CRF management, and the need for professional development were the main motivators of the application, whereas the shortage and mobility of nursing human resources and insufficient communication between doctors and nurses were the main barriers. Additionally, most nurses felt more professional and confident about their work. Regarding patient outcomes, patient knowledge, attitude and behavior scores regarding CRF self-management increased significantly. Patients' post-implementation CRF was alleviated compared with the pre-implementation treatment cycle. The PARIHS framework may provide instructive guidance for the incorporation of evidence into practice, and the process-oriented framework might provide greater operational utility of the application.",

    "articleAbstract": "Asthma represents an episodic and fluctuating behavior characterized with decreased complexity of respiratory dynamics. Several evidence indicate that asthma severity or control is associated with alteration in variability of lung function. The pathophysiological basis of alteration in complexity of breathing pattern in asthma has remained poorly understood. Regarding the point that Rho-kinase is involved in pathophysiology of asthma, in present study we investigated the effect of Rho-kinase inhibition on complexity of respiratory dynamics in a guinea pig model of asthma. Male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 12 series of inhalations with ovalbumin or saline. Animals were treated by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (1mM aerosols) prior to each allergen challenge. We recorded respiration of conscious animals using whole-body plethysmography. Exposure to ovalbumin induced lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling including goblet cell hyperplasia, increase in the thickness of airways smooth muscles and subepithelial collagen deposition. Complexity analysis of respiratory dynamics revealed a dramatic decrease in irregularity of respiratory rhythm representing less complexity in asthmatic guinea pigs. Inhibition of Rho-kinase reduced the airway remodeling and hyperreponsiveness, but had no significant effect on lung inflammation and complexity of respiratory dynamics in asthmatic animals. It seems that airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling do not significantly affect the complexity of respiratory dynamics. Our results suggest that inflammation might be the probable cause of shift in the respiratory dynamics away from the normal fluctuation in asthma.",

    "articleAbstract": "MSCs are widely applied to regenerate heart tissue in myocardial diseases but when grown in standard two-dimensional (2D) cultures exhibit limited potential for cardiac repair and develop fibrogenic features with increasing culture time. MSCs can undergo partial cardiomyogenic differentiation, which improves their cardiac repair capacity. When applied to collagen patches they may improve cardiac tissue regeneration but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the regenerative properties of MSCs grown in a collagen scaffold as a three-dimensional (3D) culture system, and performed functional analysis using an engineered heart tissue (EHT) model. We showed that the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins by MSCs co-cultured with rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was increased in collagen patches versus conventional cultures. MSCs in 3D collagen patches were less fibrogenic, secreted more cardiotrophic factors, retained anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory function, and responded less to TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. EHT analysis showed no effects by MSCs on cardiomyocyte function, whereas control dermal fibroblasts abrogated the beating of cardiac tissue constructs. We conclude that 3D collagen scaffold improves the cardioprotective effects of MSCs by enhancing the production of trophic factors and modifying their immune modulatory and fibrogenic phenotype. The improvement in myocardial function by MSCs after acquisition of a partial cardiac cell-like phenotype is not due to enhanced MSC contractility. A better understanding of the mechanisms of MSC-mediated tissue repair will help to further enhance the therapeutic potency of MSCs.",

    "articleAbstract": "Today, a considerable proportion of the public political discourse on nationwide elections proceeds in Online Social Networks. Through analyzing this content, we can discover the major themes that prevailed during the discussion, investigate the temporal variation of positive and negative sentiment and examine the semantic proximity of these themes. According to existing studies, the results of similar tasks are heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of dictionaries for linguistic preprocessing, entity discovery and sentiment analysis. Additionally, noise reduction is achieved with methods for sarcasm detection and correction. Here we report on the application of these methods on the complete corpus of tweets regarding two local electoral events of worldwide impact: the Greek referendum of 2015 and the subsequent legislative elections. To this end, we compiled novel dictionaries for sentiment and entity detection for the Greek language tailored to these events. We subsequently performed volume analysis, sentiment analysis, sarcasm correction and topic modeling. Results showed that there was a strong anti-austerity sentiment accompanied with a critical view on European and Greek political actions.",

    "articleAbstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This risk is magnified by certain antiretrovirals, particularly the protease inhibitor ritonavir, but the pathophysiology of this connection is unknown. We postulated that a major mechanism for antiretroviral-associated cardiac disease is pathologic fibrosis linked to platelet activation with release and activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and that these changes could be modeled in a murine system. We also sought to intervene utilizing inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) as proof-of-concept for therapeutics capable of regulating TGF-β1 signaling and collagen autophagy. We demonstrate decreased cardiac function indices, including cardiac output, ejection fraction and stroke volume, and prominent cardiac fibrosis, in mice exposed to pharmacological doses of ritonavir. Cardiac output and fibrosis correlated with plasma TGF-β1 levels. Mice with targeted deletion of TGF-β1 in megakaryocytes/platelets (PF4CreTgfb1flox/flox) were partially protected from ritonavir-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. Inhalation of low dose CO (250ppm), used as a surrogate for upregulation of inducible heme oxygenase/endogenous CO pathways, suppressed ritonavir-induced cardiac fibrosis. This occurred in association with modulation of canonical (Smad2) and non-canonical (p38) TGF-β1 signaling pathways. In addition, CO treatment suppressed the M1 pro-inflammatory subset of macrophages and increased M2c regulatory cells in the hearts of RTV-exposed animals. The effects of CO were dependent upon autophagy as CO did not mitigate ritonavir-induced fibrosis in autophagy-deficient LC3-/- mice. These results suggest that platelet-derived TGF-β1 contributes to ritonavir-associated cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis, extending the relevance of our findings to other antiretrovirals that also activate platelets. The anti-fibrotic effects of CO are linked to alterations in TGF-β1 signaling and autophagy, suggesting a proof-of-concept for novel interventions in HIV/antiretroviral therapy-mediated cardiovascular disease.",

    "articleAbstract": "Leptin and its receptor play several physiological roles in the canine gallbladder, and the dysregulation of leptin might play a role in the pathogenesis of gallbladder diseases such as gallbladder mucocele. Previous studies revealed a positive association between hyperlipidemia and gallstones in humans. However, the latter is still unclear in dogs with cholelithiasis. In this study, we examined the differences in leptin, leptin receptor, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels between healthy dogs and dogs with cholelithiasis, and evaluated the correlation between leptin and hyperlipidemia. Twenty-eight healthy dogs and 34 client-owned dogs with cholelithiasis were enrolled in the study. Leptin concentrations and lipid profiles were determined from sera, and leptin and leptin receptor expression levels were quantified in gallbladder tissue. In dogs with cholelithiasis, serum concentrations of leptin (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p < 0.001), and triglycerides (p < 0.001) were significantly higher compared with those in healthy dogs. Positive correlations were observed between serum leptin and total cholesterol (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.89, r = 0.725, p < 0.001), and between leptin and triglycerides (95% CI = 0.63-0.89, r = 0.782, p < 0.001) in the cholelithiasis group. Hypercholesterolemia (Odds Ratio (OR) = 9.720; 95% CI = 1.148-82.318) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 12.913; 95% CI = 1.548-107.722) were shown to be risk factors for gallstone disease. In cholelithiasis patients who underwent cholecystectomy, serum leptin levels were significantly higher than in patients that had not undergone surgery (p < 0.001). Leptin and leptin receptor expression was upregulated in the gallbladder tissues of cholelithiasis patients (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). These results indicate that increased serum leptin concentrations and hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia) are associated with canine cholelithiasis and that homeostatic imbalance of these parameters might affect the pathogenesis of gallstones.",

    "articleAbstract": "We describe a wearable sensor developed for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) exercise. To effectively guide CR exercise, the dedicated CR wearable sensor (DCRW) automatically recommends the exercise intensity to the patient by comparing heart rate (HR) measured in real time with a predefined target heart rate zone (THZ) during exercise. The CR exercise includes three periods: pre-exercise, exercise with intensity guidance, and post-exercise. In the pre-exercise period, information such as THZ, exercise type, exercise stage order, and duration of each stage are set up through a smartphone application we developed for iPhones and Android devices. The set-up information is transmitted to the DCRW via Bluetooth communication. In the period of exercise with intensity guidance, the DCRW continuously estimates HR using a reflected pulse signal in the wrist. To achieve accurate HR measurements, we used multichannel photo sensors and increased the chances of acquiring a clean signal. Subsequently, we used singular value decomposition (SVD) for de-noising. For the median and variance of RMSEs in the measured HRs, our proposed method with DCRW provided lower values than those from a single channel-based method and template-based multiple-channel method for the entire exercise stage. In the post-exercise period, the DCRW transmits all the measured HR data to the smartphone application via Bluetooth communication, and the patient can monitor his/her own exercise history.",

    "articleAbstract": "Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) imaging can differentiate tissue types based on their nanoscale molecular structure. However, characterization of the coherent scattering cross-section profile of relevant tissues is needed to optimally design SAXS imaging techniques for a variety of biomedical applications. Reported measured nervous tissue x-ray scattering cross sections under a synchrotron source have had limited agreement. We report a set of x-ray cross-section measurements obtained from planar SAXS imaging of 1 mm thick mouse brain (APP/PS1 wild-type) coronal slices using an 8 keV laboratory x-ray source. Two characteristic peaks were found at 0.96 and 1.60 nm-1 attributed to myelin. The peak intensities varied by location in the slice. We found that regions of gray matter, white matter, and corpus callosum could be segmented by their increasing intensities of myelin peaks respectively. Measured small-angle x-ray scattering cross sections were then used to define brain tissue scattering properties in a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation of SAXS computed tomography (CT) using a higher monochromatic x-ray energy (20 keV) to study design trade-offs for noninvasive in vivo SAXS imaging on a small-animal head including radiation dose, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the effect of skull presence on the previous two metrics. Simulation results show the estimated total dose to the mouse head for a single SAXS-CT slice was 149.4 mGy. The pixel SNR was approximately 30.8 for white matter material whether or not a skull was present. In this early-stage proof-of-principle work, we have demonstrated our brain cross-section data and simulation tools can be used to assess optimal instrument parameters for dedicated small-animal SAXS-CT prototypes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Pneumococcal disease causes substantial morbidity and mortality, including among adults. Adult pneumococcal vaccines help to prevent these burdens, but they are underused. Accounting for the full benefits of adult pneumococcal vaccination may promote more rational resource allocation decisions with respect to adult pneumococcal vaccines.Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to assess the extent to which the literature has empirically captured (e.g., through measurement or modeling) the full benefits of adult pneumococcal vaccination.We systematically searched PubMed and Embase to identify studies published between January 1, 2010 and April 10, 2016 that examine adult pneumococcal vaccination. We included articles if they captured any health or economic benefit of an adult pneumococcal vaccine administered to adults age ≥ 50 or ≥ 18 in risk groups. Finally, we summarized the literature by categorizing the types of benefits captured, the perspective taken, and the strength of the evidence presented. Our protocol is number 42016038335 in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews.We identified 5,857 papers and included 150 studies for analysis. While most capture health gains and healthcare cost savings, far fewer studies consider additional benefit categories, such as productivity gains. However, the studies with a broader approach still exhibit significant limitations; for example, many present only abstracts, while others offer no new measurements. Studies that examine the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine focus more on broad economic benefits, but still have limitations.This review highlights the need for more robust empirical accounting of the full benefits of adult pneumococcal vaccination. Literature outside this realm indicates that these broad benefits may be substantial. Failing to investigate the full benefits may lead society to undervalue vaccines' contributions and therefore underinvest in their development and adoption.",

For improving the antitumor activity and tumor selectivity of EEDQ2, we prepared transferrin (Tf)-modified liposomes (LPs) to deliver EEDQ2. When HeLa and Hep G2 cells were treated with LP-delivered EEDQ2, the ROS level was significantly enhanced, and mitochondrial membrane potential was reversed. Tf-LPs improved cell uptake of EEDQ2 by about 3.7 times compared with non-targeted LPs. These data suggest that Tf-LPs delivering EEDQ2 is a promising strategy to treat cancer.",

    "articleAbstract": "Winter air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia is among the worst in the world. The health impacts of policy decisions affecting air pollution exposures in Ulaanbaatar were modeled and evaluated under business as usual and two more-strict alternative emissions pathways through 2024. Previous studies have relied on either outdoor or indoor concentrations to assesses the health risks of air pollution, but the burden is really a function of total exposure. This study combined projections of indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 with population time-activity estimates to develop trajectories of total age-specific PM2.5 exposure for the Ulaanbaatar population. Indoor PM2.5 contributions from secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) were estimated in order to fill out total exposures, and changes in population and background disease were modeled. The health impacts were derived using integrated exposure-response curves from the Global Burden of Disease Study.Annual average population-weighted PM2.5 exposures at baseline (2014) were estimated at 59 μg/m3. These were dominated by exposures occurring indoors, influenced considerably by infiltrated outdoor pollution. Under current control policies, exposures increased slightly to 60 μg/m3 by 2024; under moderate emissions reductions and under a switch to clean technologies, exposures were reduced from baseline levels by 45% and 80%, respectively. The moderate improvement pathway decreased per capita annual disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and death burdens by approximately 40%. A switch to clean fuels decreased per capita annual DALY and death burdens by about 85% by 2024 with the relative SHS contribution increasing substantially.This study demonstrates a way to combine estimated changes in total exposure, background disease and population levels, and exposure-response functions to project the health impacts of alternative policy pathways. The resulting burden analysis highlights the need for aggressive action, including the elimination of residential coal burning and the reduction of current smoking rates.",

    "articleAbstract": "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the U.S. We investigated characteristics of HCV-infected patients registered for OLT, and explored factors associated with mortality. Data were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation network (UNOS/OPTN) registry. Analyses included 41,157 HCV-mono-infected patients ≥18 years of age listed for cadaveric OLT between February 2002 and June 2014. Characteristics associated with pre- and post-transplant survival and time trends over the study period were determined by logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses and Poisson regressions. Most patients were white (69.1%) and male (70.8%). At waitlist registration, mean age was 54.6 years and mean MELD was 16. HCC was recorded in 26.9% of the records. A total of 51.2% of the patients received an OLT, 21.0% died or were too sick; 15.6% were delisted and 10.4% were still waiting. Factors associated with increased waitlist mortality were older age, female gender, blood type 0, diabetes, no HCC and transplant region (p<0.001). OLT recipient characteristics associated with increased risk for post OLT mortality were female gender, age, diabetes, race (p<0,0001), and allocation MELD (p = 0.005). Donor characteristics associated with waitlist mortality included age, ethnicity (p<0.0001) and diabetes (p<0.03). Waitlist registrations and OLTs for HCC significantly increased from 14.4% to 37.3% and 27.8% to 38.5%, respectively (p<0.0001). Pre- and post-transplant survival depended on a variety of patient-, donor-, and allocation- characteristics of which most remain relevant in the DAA-era. Still, intensified HCV screening strategies and timely and effective treatment of HCV are highly relevant to reduce the burden of HCV-related OLTs in the U.S.",

    "articleAbstract": "With growing demand and highly variable inter-annual water supplies, California's water use future is fraught with uncertainty. Climate change projections, anticipated population growth, and continued agricultural intensification, will likely stress existing water supplies in coming decades. Using a state-and-transition simulation modeling approach, we examine a broad suite of spatially explicit future land use scenarios and their associated county-level water use demand out to 2062. We examined a range of potential water demand futures sampled from a 20-year record of historical (1992-2012) data to develop a suite of potential future land change scenarios, including low/high change scenarios for urbanization and agriculture as well as \"lowest of the low\" and \"highest of the high\" anthropogenic use. Future water demand decreased 8.3 billion cubic meters (Bm3) in the lowest of the low scenario and decreased 0.8 Bm3 in the low agriculture scenario. The greatest increased water demand was projected for the highest of the high land use scenario (+9.4 Bm3), high agricultural expansion (+4.6 Bm3), and high urbanization (+2.1 Bm3) scenarios. Overall, these scenarios show agricultural land use decisions will likely drive future demand more than increasing municipal and industrial uses, yet improved efficiencies across all sectors could lead to potential water use savings. Results provide water managers with information on diverging land use and water use futures, based on historical, observed land change trends and water use histories.",

    "articleAbstract": "Cathepsin K (CatK) is a cysteine protease that plays an important role in mammalian intra- and extracellular protein turnover and is known for its unique and potent collagenase activity. Through studies on the mechanism of its collagenase activity, selective ectosteric sites were identified that are remote from the active site. Inhibitors targeting these ectosteric sites are collagenase selective and do not interfere with other proteolytic activities of the enzyme. Potential ectosteric inhibitors were identified using a computational approach to screen the druggable subset of and the entire 281,987 compounds comprising Chemical Repository library of the National Cancer Institute-Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI-DTP). Compounds were scored based on their affinity for the ectosteric site. Here we compared the scores of three individual molecular docking methods with that of a composite score of all three methods together. The composite docking method was up to five-fold more effective at identifying potent collagenase inhibitors (IC50 < 20 μM) than the individual methods. Of 160 top compounds tested in enzymatic assays, 28 compounds revealed blocking of the collagenase activity of CatK at 100 μM. Two compounds exhibited IC50 values below 5 μM corresponding to a molar protease:inhibitor concentration of <1:12. Both compounds were subsequently tested in osteoclast bone resorption assays where the most potent inhibitor, 10-[2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]-7,8-diethylbenzo[g]pteridine-2,4-dione, (NSC-374902), displayed an inhibition of bone resorption with an IC50-value of approximately 300 nM and no cell toxicity effects.",

Meta-analyses were conducted using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models to determine pooled HCV viremic rate by risk population or subpopulation, country/subregion, sex, and study sampling method. Random-effects meta-regressions were conducted to identify predictors of higher viremic rate.Analyses were conducted on 178 measures for HCV viremic rate among 19,593 HCV antibody positive individuals. In the MENA region, the overall pooled mean viremic rate was 67.6% (95% CI: 64.9-70.3%). Across risk populations, the pooled mean rate ranged between 57.4% (95% CI: 49.4-65.2%) in people who inject drugs, and 75.5% (95% CI: 61.0-87.6%) in populations with liver-related conditions. Across countries/subregions, the pooled mean rate ranged between 62.1% (95% CI: 50.0-72.7%) and 70.4% (95% CI: 65.5-75.1%). Similar pooled estimates were further observed by risk subpopulation, sex, and sampling method. None of the hypothesized population-level predictors of higher viremic rate were statistically significant.Two-thirds of HCV antibody positive individuals in MENA are chronically infected. Though there is extensive variation in study-specific measures of HCV viremic rate, pooled mean estimates are similar regardless of risk population or subpopulation, country/subregion, HCV antibody prevalence in the background population, or sex. HCV viremic rate is a useful indicator to track the progress in (and coverage of) HCV treatment programs towards the set target of HCV elimination by 2030.",

    "articleAbstract": "Varroa destructor is one of the most common parasites of honey bee colonies and is considered as a possible co-factor for honey bee decline. At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated.",

The association of incidence, number, location, and pathology of colorectal neoplasm with grades and distribution of melanosis coli were analyzed.Melanosis coli was associated with significantly more colorectal polyps than control, a higher incidence of numerous colorectal polyps (number ≥ 20) (7.3% vs 0.5%; p < 0.001), and higher number of small colorectal polyps (diameter ≤ 5 mm; p < 0.01). Patients with melanosis coli had higher incidences of low-grade adenomas (31.1% vs 23.3%, p < 0.05) and non-adenoma polyps (20.1% vs 12.8%, p < 0.05) than the controls. On multivariate analysis, melanosis coli was independently associated with increased detecting rates of low grade adenoma (OR = 1.54; 95%: 1.06-2.23; p < .05), non-adenoma polyp (OR = 1.72; 95%: 1.11-2.70; p < .05) and numerous polyps (OR = 16.2, 95%: 3.66-71.6; p < .05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of high-grade adenomas or adenocarcinomas in the two population groups, but the numbers of these lesions were insufficient to permit firm conclusions. No significant differences in incidence, number, and pathology of colorectal polyps between individuals with melanosis coli of three different grades of severity were found. Melanosis located predominantly in the right colon had an interestingly lower incidence of colonic polyps in right colon than did melanosis located predominantly in the left colon or total colon (8.9% vs. 26.3%, 24.0%, p < 0.05). Patients with melanosis coli had significantly more nonspecific distal ileal ulcers than did controls (8.0% vs 0%, p < 0.001).Melanosis coli is associated with a higher incidence and number of colonic non-adenoma polyps and low-grade adenomas, and higher incidence of distal ileal ulcers. Melanosis coli may not be a harmless pigmentation, but a sign of chronic injury of colonic and intestinal mucosa.",

However, comparable studies on rDNA site number variation in plants, assessed with extensive hierarchical sampling at several levels (individuals, populations, species) are lacking. In exploring the possible causes for ribosomal loci dynamism, we have used the diploid genus Anacyclus (Asteraceae) as a suitable system to examine the evolution of ribosomal loci. To this end, the number and chromosomal position of 45S rDNA sites have been determined in 196 individuals from 47 populations in all Anacyclus species using FISH. The 45S rDNA site-number has been assessed in a significant sample of seed plants, which usually exhibit rather consistent features, except for polyploid plants. In contrast, the level of rDNA site-number variation detected in Anacyclus is outstanding in the context of angiosperms particularly regarding populations of the same species. The number of 45S rDNA sites ranged from four to 11, accounting for 14 karyological ribosomal phenotypes. Our results are not even across species and geographical areas, and show that there is no clear association between the number of 45S rDNA loci and the life cycle in Anacyclus. A single rDNA phenotype was detected in several species, but a more complex pattern that included intra-specific and intra-population polymorphisms was recorded in A. homogamos, A. clavatus and A. valentinus, three weedy species showing large and overlapping distribution ranges. It is likely that part of the cytogenetic changes and inferred dynamism found in these species have been triggered by genomic rearrangements resulting from contemporary hybridisation.",

    "articleAbstract": "Asthma is a multifactorial pathology influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Glucocorticoid treatment decreases symptoms by regulating genes involved in the inflammatory process through binding to specific DNA sequences. Polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the Prostaglandin D Receptor (PTGDR) gene have been related to asthma. We aimed to analyze the effect of PTGDR promoter haplotypes on gene expression and response to corticosteroid therapy. A549 lung epithelial cells were transfected with vectors carrying four different PTGDR haplotypes (CTCT, CCCC, CCCT and TCCT), and treated with dexamethasone. Different approaches to study the promoter activity (Dual Luciferase Reporter System), gene expression levels (qPCR) and cytokine secretion (Multiplexed Bead-based Flow Cytometric) were used. In addition, in silico analysis was also performed. Cells carrying the TCCT haplotype showed the lowest promoter activity (p-value<0.05) and mRNA expression levels in basal conditions. After dexamethasone treatment, cells carrying the wild-type variant CTCT showed the highest response, and those carrying the TCCT variant the lowest (p-value<0.05) in luciferase assays. Different transcription factor binding patterns were identified in silico. Moreover, differences in cytokine secretion were also found among different promoter haplotypes. Polymorphisms of PTGDR gene influence basal promoter activity and gene expression, as well as the cytokine secretory pattern. Furthermore, an association between these positions and response to corticoid treatment was observed.",

    "articleAbstract": "The objectives were to analyze the knowledge about overdose prevention, the use of naloxone, and the number of fatal overdoses after the implementation of Systematic Training in Overdose Prevention (STOOP) program. We conducted a quasi-experimental study, and held face-to-face interviews before (n = 725) and after (n = 722) implementation of systematic training in two different samples of people who injected opioids attending harm reduction centers. We asked participants to list the main causes of overdose and the main actions that should be taken when witnessing an overdose. We created two dependent variables, the number of (a) correct and (b) incorrect answers. The main independent variable was Study Group: Intervention Group (IG), Comparison Group (CG), Pre-Intervention Group With Sporadic Training in Overdose Prevention (PREIGS), or Pre-Intervention Group Without Training in Overdose Prevention (PREIGW). The relationship between the dependent and independent variables was assessed using a multivariate Poisson regression analysis. Finally, we conducted an interrupted time series analysis of monthly fatal overdoses before and after the implementation of systematic program during the period 2006-2015. Knowledge of overdose prevention increased after implementing systematic training program. Compared to the PREIGW, the IG gave more correct answers (IRR = 1.40;95%CI:1.33-1.47), and fewer incorrect answers (IRR = 0.33;95%CI:0.25-0.44). Forty percent of people who injected opioids who received a naloxone kit had used the kit in response to an overdose they witnessed. These courses increase knowledge of overdose prevention in people who use opioids, give them the necessary skills to use naloxone, and slightly diminish the number of fatal opioid overdoses in the city of Barcelona.",

    "articleAbstract": "Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome that predisposes a patient to the formation of basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts, and skeletal anomalies. Causative mutations in several genes associated with the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, including PTCH1, have been identified in Gorlin syndrome patients. However, no definitive genotype-phenotype correlations are evident in these patients, and their clinical presentation varies greatly, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. We generated iPSCs from four unrelated Gorlin syndrome patients with loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 using the Sendai virus vector (SeVdp(KOSM)302). The patient-derived iPSCs exhibited basic iPSC features, including stem cell marker expression, totipotency, and the ability to form teratomas. GLI1 expression levels were greater in fibroblasts and patient-derived iPSCs than in the corresponding control cells. Patient-derived iPSCs expressed lower basal levels than control iPSCs of the genes encoding the Hh ligands Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and SHH, the Hh acetyltransferase HHAT, Wnt proteins, BMP4, and BMP6. Most of these genes were upregulated in patient-derived iPSCs grown in osteoblast differentiation medium (OBM) and downregulated in control iPSCs cultured in OBM. The expression of GLI1 and GLI2 substantially decreased in both control and patient-derived iPSCs cultured in OBM, whereas GLI3, SHH, and IHH were upregulated in patient-derived iPSCs and downregulated in control iPSCs grown in OBM. Activation of Smoothened by SAG in cells grown in OBM significantly enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity in patient-derived iPSCs compared with control iPSC lines. In summary, patient-derived iPSCs expressed lower basal levels than the control iPSCs of the genes encoding Hh, Wnt, and bone morphogenetic proteins, but their expression of these genes strongly increased under osteogenic conditions. These findings indicate that patient-derived iPSCs are hypersensitive to osteogenic induction. We propose that Hh signaling is constituently active in iPSCs from Gorlin syndrome patients, enhancing their response to osteogenic induction and contributing to disease-associated abnormalities.",

We investigated its effect on hospital expenditure in a Western-European healthcare system, with universal access.Skeletal muscle mass (assessed on CT) and costs were obtained for patients who underwent curative-intent abdominal cancer surgery. Low skeletal muscle mass was defined based on pre-established cut-offs. The relationship between low skeletal muscle mass and hospital costs was assessed using linear regression analysis and Mann-Whitney U-tests.452 patients were included (median age 65, 61.5% males). Patients underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (38.9%), colorectal liver metastases (27.4%), primary liver tumours (23.2%), and pancreatic/periampullary cancer (10.4%). In total, 45.6% had sarcopenia. Median costs were €2,183 higher in patients with low compared with patients with high skeletal muscle mass (€17,144 versus €14,961; P<0.001). Hospital costs incrementally increased with lower sex-specific skeletal muscle mass quartiles (P = 0.029). After adjustment for confounders, low skeletal muscle mass was associated with a cost increase of €4,061 (P = 0.015).Low skeletal muscle mass was independently associated with increased hospital costs of about €4,000 per patient. Strategies to reduce skeletal muscle wasting could reduce hospital costs in an era of incremental healthcare costs and an increasingly ageing population.",

    "articleAbstract": "An investigation based on in-situ surveys combined with remote sensing and GIS analysis revealed fast shoreline retreat on the side of a major waterway, the Malamocco Marghera Channel, in the Lagoon of Venice, Italy. Monthly and long-term regression rates caused by ship wakes in a reclaimed industrial area were considered. The short-term analysis, based on field surveys carried out between April 2014 and January 2015, revealed that the speed of shoreline regression was insignificantly dependent on the distance from the navigation channel, but was not constant through time. Periods of high water levels due to tidal forcing or storm surges, more common in the winter season, are characterized by faster regression rates. The retreat is a discontinuous process in time and space depending on the morpho-stratigraphy and the vegetation cover of the artificial deposits. A GIS analysis performed with the available imagery shows an average retreat of 3-4 m/yr in the period between 1974 and 2015. Digitization of historical maps and bathymetric surveys made in April 2015 enabled the construction of two digital terrain models for both past and present situations. The two models have been used to calculate the total volume of sediment lost during the period 1968-2015 (1.19×106 m3). The results show that in the presence of heavy ship traffic, ship-channel interactions can dominate the morphodynamics of a waterway and its margins. The analysis enables a better understanding of how shallow-water systems react to the human activities in the post-industrial period. An adequate evaluation of the temporal and spatial variation of shoreline position is also crucial for the development of future scenarios and for the sustainable management port traffic worldwide.",

The amendment to the infection protection act (IfSG) from 29 March 2013 requires local and state public health agencies to report surveillance data within one working day instead of one week. We analysed factors associated with reporting time and evaluated the IfSG amendment. Local reporting time is the time between date of notification and date of export to the state public health agency and state reporting time is time between date of arrival at the state public health agency and the date of export. We selected cases reported between 28 March 2012 and 28 March 2014. We calculated the median local and state reporting time, stratified by potentially influential factors, computed a negative binominal regression model and assessed quality and workload parameters. Before the IfSG amendment the median local reporting time was 4 days and 1 day afterwards. The state reporting time was 0 days before and after. Influential factors are the individual local public health agency, the notified disease, the notification software and the day of the week. Data quality and workload parameters did not change. The IfSG amendment has decreased local reporting time, no relevant loss of data quality or identifiable workload-increase could be detected. State reporting time is negligible. We recommend efforts to harmonise practices of local public health agencies including the exclusive use of software with fully compatible interfaces.",

    "articleAbstract": "Fetuin-A / α2-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein (gene name Ahsg) is a systemic inhibitor of ectopic calcification. Due to its high affinity for calcium phosphate, fetuin-A is highly abundant in mineralized bone matrix. Foreshortened femora in fetuin-A-deficient Ahsg-/- mice indicated a role for fetuin-A in bone formation. We studied early postnatal bone development in fetuin-A-deficient mice and discovered that femora from Ahsg-/- mice exhibited severely displaced distal epiphyses and deformed growth plates, similar to the human disease slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The growth plate slippage occurred in 70% of Ahsg-/- mice of both sexes around three weeks postnatal. At this time point, mice weaned and rapidly gained weight and mobility. Epiphysis slippage never occurred in wildtype and heterozygous Ahsg+/- mice. Homozygous fetuin-A-deficient Ahsg-/- mice and, to a lesser degree, heterozygous Ahsg+/- mice showed lesions separating the proliferative zone from the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate. The hypertrophic growth plate cartilage in long bones from Ahsg-/- mice was significantly elongated and V-shaped until three weeks of age and thus prior to the slippage. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of laser-dissected distal femoral growth plates from 13-day-old Ahsg-/- mice revealed a JAK-STAT-mediated inflammatory response including a 550-fold induction of the chemokine Cxcl9. At this stage, vascularization of the elongated growth plates was impaired, which was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. Thus, fetuin-A-deficient mice may serve as a rodent model of growth plate pathologies including SCFE and inflammatory cartilage degradation.",

    "articleAbstract": "China has a high burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). As irrational use and inadequate dosing of anti-TB drugs may contribute to the epidemic of drug-resistant TB, we assessed the drug types and dosages prescribed in the treatment of TB cases in a representative sample of health care facilities in Yunnan.We applied multistage cluster sampling using probability proportion to size to select 28 counties in Yunnan. Consecutive pulmonary TB patients were enrolled from either the TB centers of Yunnan Center of Disease Control or designated TB hospitals. Outcomes of interest included the regimen used in the treatment of new and retreatment TB patients; and the proportion of patients treated with adequate dosing of anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, we assess whether there has been reduction in the use of fluoroquinolone and second line injectables in Tuberculosis Clinical Centre (TCC) after the training activity in late 2012.Of 2390 TB patients enrolled, 582 (24.4%) were prescribed second line anti-TB drugs (18.0% in new cases and 60.9% in retreatment cases); 363(15.2%) prescribed a fluoroquinolone. General hospitals (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-2.66), retreatment TB cases (adjOR 4.75, 95% CI 3.59-6.27), smear positive cases (adjOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.33), and extrapulmonary TB (adjOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.66-4.03) were significantly associated with the use of fluoroquinolones. The proportion of patients treated with fluoroquinolones decreased from 41.4% before 2013 to 13.5% after 2013 (adjOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.12-0.28) in TCC. The proportion of patients with correct, under and over dosages of isoniazid was 88.2%, 1.5%, and 10.4%, respectively; of rifampicin was 50.2%, 46.8%, and 2.9%; of pyrazinamide was 67.6%, 31.7% and 0.7%; and of ethambutol was 41.4%, 57.5%, and 1.0%.The prescribing practice of anti-TB drugs was not standardized, findings with significant programmatic implication.",

    "articleAbstract": "Visual hallucinations (VHs) are among the most striking features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Given that Lewy body pathology is frequently observed in the brains of patients with AD, we aimed to study factors associated with VHs in AD and examine their association with DLB features. This cross-sectional study enrolled a consecutive series of AD patients who visited the dementia clinic of a regional hospital. Clinically diagnosed possible or probable DLB cases were excluded. VH frequency and associated factors including age, sex, education, disease severity, DLB features, vascular risk factors, cognitive function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were compared between AD patients with VHs (VH+) and those without VHs (VH-). Among a total of 295 patients analyzed, 42 (14.2%) had VHs. After adjusting for age, sex, and disease severity, DLB features including fluctuations in cognition scores, rapid-eye-movement behavioral disorder (RBD), and severe neuroleptic sensitivity were more frequent in the VH+ group. Furthermore, depression score, total Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score, and total caregiver burden score as assessed by the NPI were higher in the VH+ group. Among neuropsychiatric symptoms, delusions, hallucinations in the non-visual domains, anxiety, and disinhibition were more frequent in the VH+ group. Conversely, none of the vascular risk factors (VRFs) or cognitive domains of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was associated with VHs in AD. In summary, VHs, albeit occurring at a low rate, had a high impact on AD. Diagnostic features of DLB, including fluctuations, RBD, and severe neuroleptic sensitivity were significantly associated with VHs in AD. AD patients with VHs tended to have more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and greater caregiver burden.",

    "articleAbstract": "The success of medical threatments with DNA and silencing interference RNA is strongly related to the design of efficient delivery technologies. Cationic polymers represent an attractive strategy to serve as nucleic-acid carriers with the envisioned advantages of efficient complexation, low cost, ease of production, well-defined size, and low polydispersity index. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity (safety) of these polymers is a challenge and in need of improvement. With the aim of designing more effective polycationic-based gene carriers, many parameters such as carrier morphology, size, molecular weight, surface chemistry, and flexibility/rigidity ratio need to be taken into consideration. In the present work, the binding mechanism of three cationic polymers (polyarginine, polylysine and polyethyleneimine) to a model siRNA target is computationally investigated at the atomistic level. In order to better understand the polycationic carrier-siRNA interactions, replica exchange molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to provide an exhaustive exploration of all the possible binding sites, taking fully into account the siRNA flexibility together with the presence of explicit solvent and ions. Moreover, well-tempered metadynamics simulations were employed to elucidate how molecular geometry, polycation flexibility, and charge neutralization affect the siRNA-polycations free energy landscape in term of low-energy binding modes and unbinding free energy barriers. Significant differences among polymer binding modes have been detected, revealing the advantageous binding properties of polyarginine and polylysine compared to polyethyleneimine.",

    "articleAbstract": "Stone cell content is thought to be one of the key determinants for fruit quality in pears. However, the molecular mechanism of stone cell development remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the stone cell clusters (SCCs) distribution and area in 'Dangshan Su' (with abundant stone cells) were higher as compared to 'Lianglizaosu' (low stone cell content bud sport of 'Dangshan Su') based on the histochemical staining, and the correlations of lignin content with stone cell content and SCC area was significant. The fruits of 'Dangshan Su' and 'Lianglizaosu' at three different developmental stages (23 and 55 days after flowering and mature) were sampled for comparative transcriptome analysis to explore the metabolic pathways associated with stone cell development. A total of 42444 unigenes were obtained from two varieties, among which 7203 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparison of the six transcriptomes. Specifically, many DEGs associated with lignin biosynthesis were identified, including coumaroylquinate 3-monooxygenase (C3H), shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD), as well as genes related to carbon metabolism, such as sorbitol dehydrogenase-like (SDH-like) and ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK). At the peak of the stone cell content (55 days after flowering), the expression level of these genes in 'Dangshan Su' was significantly increased compared with 'Lianglizaosu', indicating that these genes were closely related to stone cell development. We validated the transcriptional levels of 33 DEGs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The results were consistent with the transcriptome analysis, indicating the reliability of transcriptome data. In addition, subcellular localization analysis of three DEGs in lignin synthesis (PbC3H, PbF5H and PbPOD) revealed that these proteins are mainly distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of stone cell formation.",

    "articleAbstract": "Disinvestment (removal, reduction, or reallocation) of routinely provided health services can be difficult when there is little published evidence examining whether the services are effective or not. Evidence is required to understand if removing these services produces outcomes that are inferior to keeping such services in place. However, organisational imperatives, such as budget cuts, may force healthcare providers to disinvest from these services before the required evidence becomes available. There are presently no experimental studies examining the effectiveness of allied health services (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work) provided on weekends across acute medical and surgical hospital wards, despite these services being routinely provided internationally. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of removing weekend allied health services from acute medical and surgical wards using a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority research design.We conducted 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trials between 1 February 2014 and 30 April 2015 among patients on 12 acute medical or surgical hospital wards spread across 2 hospitals. The hospitals involved were 2 metropolitan teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data from n = 14,834 patients were collected for inclusion in Trial 1, and n = 12,674 in Trial 2. Trial 1 was a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority stepped-wedge trial where the 'current' weekend allied health service was incrementally removed from participating wards each calendar month, in a random order, while Trial 2 used a conventional non-inferiority stepped-wedge design, where a 'newly developed' service was incrementally reinstated on the same wards as in Trial 1. Primary outcome measures were patient length of stay (proportion staying longer than expected and mean length of stay), the proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event, and the proportion with an unplanned readmission within 28 days of discharge. The 'no weekend allied health service' condition was considered to be not inferior if the 95% CIs of the differences between this condition and the condition with weekend allied health service delivery were below a 2% increase in the proportion of patients who stayed in hospital longer than expected, a 2% increase in the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days, a 2% increase in the proportion who had any adverse event, and a 1-day increase in the mean length of stay. The current weekend allied health service included physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, dietetics, social work, and allied health assistant services in line with usual care at the participating sites. The newly developed weekend allied health service allowed managers at each site to reprioritise tasks being performed and the balance of hours provided by each professional group and on which days they were provided. Analyses conducted on an intention-to-treat basis demonstrated that there was no estimated effect size difference between groups in the proportion of patients staying longer than expected (weekend versus no weekend; estimated effect size difference [95% CI], p-value) in Trial 1 (0.40 versus 0.38; estimated effect size difference 0.01 [-0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.31, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin), but the proportion staying longer than expected was greater with the newly developed service compared to its no weekend service control condition (0.39 versus 0.40; estimated effect size difference 0.02 [0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.04, CI was completely below non-inferiority margin) in Trial 2. Trial 1 and 2 findings were discordant for the mean length of stay outcome (Trial 1: 5.5 versus 6.3 days; estimated effect size difference 1.3 days [0.9 to 1.8], p < 0.001, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: 5.9 versus 5.0 days; estimated effect size difference -1.6 days [-2.0 to -1.1], p < 0.001, CI was completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between conditions for the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days in either trial (Trial 1: 0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.18, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: -0.01 [-0.02 to 0.01], p = 0.62, CI completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between conditions in the proportion of patients who experienced any adverse event in Trial 1 (0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.33, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin), but a lower proportion of patients had an adverse event in Trial 2 when exposed to the no weekend allied health condition (-0.03 [-0.05 to -0.004], p = 0.02, CI completely below non-inferiority margin). Limitations of this research were that 1 of the trial wards was closed by the healthcare provider after Trial 1 and could not be included in Trial 2, and that both withdrawing the current weekend allied health service model and installing a new one may have led to an accommodation period for staff to adapt to the new service settings. Stepped-wedge trials are potentially susceptible to bias from naturally occurring change over time at the service level; however, this was adjusted for in our analyses.In Trial 1, criteria to say that the no weekend allied health condition was non-inferior to current weekend allied health condition were not met, while neither the no weekend nor current weekend allied health condition demonstrated superiority. In Trial 2, the no weekend allied health condition was non-inferior to the newly developed weekend allied health condition across all primary outcomes, and superior for the outcomes proportion of patients staying longer than expected, proportion experiencing any adverse event, and mean length of stay.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613001231730 and ACTRN12613001361796.",

    "articleAbstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of abnormal cytological findings, high risk (HR)-HPV genotypes and to identify factors associated with an abnormal cytological findings in a cohort of HIV-infected males.Retrospective observational study on HIV-infected male patients who performed screening in the absence of clinical symptoms. Cytological abnormalities were classified as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade(LSIL) or high high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of having LSIL/HSIL.Among 875 pts, abnormal cytology findings were observed in 254 (29%, 95% CI: 26.1%-32.1%) subjects: 142 (16%) had LSIL and 49 (6%) HSIL. Overall, 581 (66%, 95%CI: 63.2%-69.5%) subjects had ≥1 HR-HPV type and 269 (31%) had ≥2 HR HPV types. Multivariate logistic regression showed that subjects with multiple HR-HPV genotypes (OR = 1.351, 95%CI: 1.005-2.111) and with HPV-16 type (OR = 2.032, 95%CI: 1.313-3.146) were more likely to have LSIL/HSIL in addition to a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio, a previous diagnosis of syphilis and a positive viral load. In another multivariate model, the presence of multiple HPV types in subjects with HPV-16 type was associated with the highest adjusted OR of having a LSIL/HSIL (OR = 2.598, 95%CI: 1.460-4.624).In HIV-infected men, the prevalence of abnormal cytological findings was of 29% and of HR-HPV was 66%. The concomitant presence of HPV-16 and multiple HR genotypes was associated with an increased risk of abnormal cytological findings. These data highlight the importance of screening multiple HPV genotypes in HIV-infected patients.",

    "articleAbstract": "Plants are a promising alternative for the production of biotherapeutics. Manufacturing in-planta adds plant specific glycans. To understand immunogenic potential of these glycans, we developed a validated method to detect plant specific glycan antibodies in human serum. Using this assay, low prevalence of pre-existing anti-plant glycan antibodies was found in healthy humans (13.5%) and in glucocerebrosidase-deficient Gaucher disease (GD) patients (5%). A low incidence (9% in naïve patient and none in treatment experienced patients) of induced anti-plant glycan antibodies was observed in GD patients after up to 30 months replacement therapy treatment with taliglucerase alfa, a version of human glucocerebrosidase produced in plant cells. Detailed evaluation of clinical safety and efficacy endpoints indicated that anti-plant glycan antibodies did not affect the safety or efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in patients. This study shows the benefit of using large scale human trials to evaluate the immunogenicity risk of plant derived glycans, and indicates no apparent risk related to anti-plant glycan antibodies.",

    "articleAbstract": "Opisthorchiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the liver flukes of the Opisthorchiidae family. Both experimental and epidemiological data strongly support a role of these parasites in the etiology of the hepatobiliary pathologies and an increased risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Understanding a functional link between the infection and hepatobiliary pathologies requires a detailed description a host-parasite interaction on different levels of biological regulation including the metabolic response on the infection. The last one, however, remains practically undocumented. Here we are describing a host response on Opisthorchiidae infection using a metabolomics approach and present the first exploratory metabolomics study of an experimental model of O. felineus infection.We conducted a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based longitudinal metabolomics study involving a cohort of 30 animals with two degrees of infection and a control group. An exploratory analysis shows that the most noticeable trend (30% of total variance) in the data was related to the gender differences. Therefore further analysis was done of each gender group separately applying a multivariate extension of the ANOVA-ASCA (ANOVA simultaneous component analysis). We show that in the males the infection specific time trends are present in the main component (43.5% variance), while in the females it is presented only in the second component and covers 24% of the variance. We have selected and annotated 24 metabolites associated with the observed effects and provided a physiological interpretation of the findings.The first exploratory metabolomics study an experimental model of O. felineus infection is presented. Our data show that at early stage of infection a response of an organism unfolds in a gender specific manner. Also main physiological mechanisms affected appear rather nonspecific (a status of the metabolic stress) the data provides a set of the hypothesis for a search of the more specific metabolic markers of the Opisthorchiidae infection.",

    "articleAbstract": "Among hereditary colorectal cancer predisposing syndromes, Lynch syndrome (LS) caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a large cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala and Umeå between the years 1990-2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 MLH1+PMS2 families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study. Using a normal random effects model (NREM) we estimate a 2.1 year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model (COX-R) estimates a hazard ratio of exp(0.171), or about 1.19, for age of diagnosis between consecutive generations. LS-associated gene-specific anticipation effects are evident for MSH2 (2.6 years/generation for NREM and hazard ratio of 1.33 for COX-R) and PMS2 (7.3 years/generation and hazard ratio of 1.86). The estimated anticipation effects for MLH1 and MSH6 are smaller.",

The objective of this study was to determine if a calculated Bladder Permeability Defect Risk Score (BP-RS) based on non-invasive urinary cytokines could discriminate UIC patients from controls and IC patients without Hunner's ulcers.A national crowdsourcing effort targeted IC patients and age-matched controls to provide urine samples. Urinary cytokine levels for GRO, IL-6, and IL-8 were determined using a Luminex assay.We collected 448 urine samples from 46 states consisting of 153 IC patients (147 female, 6 male), of which 54 UIC patients (50 females, 4 male), 159 female controls, and 136 male controls. A defined BP-RS was calculated to classify UIC, or a bladder permeability defect etiology, with 89% validity.The BP-RS Score quantifies UIC risk, indicative of a bladder permeability defect etiology in a subset of IC patients. The Bladder Permeability Defect Risk Score is the first validated urine biomarker assay for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.",

    "articleAbstract": "Researchers have previously reported that hazard proximity can influence risk perception among individuals exposed to potential hazards. Understanding this relationship among coastline communities at risk of flood events caused by storms and/or tsunamis, is important because hazard proximity, should be recognized when planning and implementing preparation and mitigation actions against these events. Yet, we are not aware of studies that have examined this relationship among coastline inhabitants facing the risk of a tsunami. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between hazard proximity and perceived risk from tsunamis among coastline inhabitants. Participants were 487 residents of the coastal city of Iquique, Chile. They completed a survey during the spring of 2013 that assessed their perceived risk from several natural and non-natural hazards. We found that hazard proximity maintains a negative relationship with the perception of tsunami risk among coastline inhabitants. While this result confirms the general trend obtained in previous studies, this one is conclusive and significant. In contradiction with previous findings, we found that participants from the highest socioeconomic status reported the highest levels of risk perception. This finding can be explained by the fact that most participants from the highest socioeconomic status live closer to the coastline areas, so their risk perception reflects the place where they live, that is in a tsunami inundation zone. Once again, hazard proximity proved to be a determinant factor of risk perception. Our findings have important implications for the development of plans and programs for tsunami preparedness and mitigation. These indicate that individuals do use environmental cues to evaluate their own risk and can potentially make correct choices when having or not to evacuate. Also suggest that preparedness should incorporate how hazard proximity is recognized by individuals and communities at risk.",

We here translate RQE into a continuous diversity analogue, and then construct a multiply nested diversity partition for alleles, individuals, populations, and species, each component of which exhibits the behavior of proper diversity metrics, and then translate these components into [0,1]-scaled form. We also deploy non-parametric statistical tests of the among-stratum components and novel tests of the homogeneity of within-stratum diversity components at any hierarchical level. We then illustrate this new analysis with eight nSSR loci and a pair of close Australian marsupial (Antechinus) congeners, using both 'different is different' and 'degree of difference' distance metrics. The total diversity in the collection is larger than that within either species, but most of the within-species diversity is resident within single populations. The combined A. agilis collection exhibits more diversity than does the combined A. stuartii collection, possibly attributable to localized differences in either local ecological disturbance regimes or differential levels of population isolation. Beyond exhibiting different allelic compositions, the two congeners are becoming more divergent for the arrays of allele sizes they possess.",

    "articleAbstract": "Based on the traditional Fast Retina Keypoint (FREAK) feature description algorithm, this paper proposed a Gravity-FREAK feature description algorithm based on Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) sensor to overcome the limited computing performance and memory resources of mobile devices and further improve the reality interaction experience of clients through digital information added to the real world by augmented reality technology. The algorithm takes the gravity projection vector corresponding to the feature point as its feature orientation, which saved the time of calculating the neighborhood gray gradient of each feature point, reduced the cost of calculation and improved the accuracy of feature extraction. In the case of registration method of matching and tracking natural features, the adaptive and generic corner detection based on the Gravity-FREAK matching purification algorithm was used to eliminate abnormal matches, and Gravity Kaneda-Lucas Tracking (KLT) algorithm based on MEMS sensor can be used for the tracking registration of the targets and robustness improvement of tracking registration algorithm under mobile environment.",

    "articleAbstract": "Gonorrhoea is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections in England. Over 41,000 cases were recorded in 2015, more than half of which occurred in men who have sex with men (MSM). As the bacterium has developed resistance to each first-line antibiotic in turn, we need an improved understanding of fitness benefits and costs of antibiotic resistance to inform control policy and planning. Cefixime was recommended as a single-dose treatment for gonorrhoea from 2005 to 2010, during which time resistance increased, and subsequently declined.We developed a stochastic compartmental model representing the natural history and transmission of cefixime-sensitive and cefixime-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in MSM in England, which was applied to data on diagnoses and prescriptions between 2008 and 2015. We estimated that asymptomatic carriers play a crucial role in overall transmission dynamics, with 37% (95% credible interval CrI 24%-52%) of infections remaining asymptomatic and untreated, accounting for 89% (95% CrI 82%-93%) of onward transmission. The fitness cost of cefixime resistance in the absence of cefixime usage was estimated to be such that the number of secondary infections caused by resistant strains is only about half as much as for the susceptible strains, which is insufficient to maintain persistence. However, we estimated that treatment of cefixime-resistant strains with cefixime was unsuccessful in 83% (95% CrI 53%-99%) of cases, representing a fitness benefit of resistance. This benefit was large enough to counterbalance the fitness cost when 31% (95% CrI 26%-36%) of cases were treated with cefixime, and when more than 55% (95% CrI 44%-66%) of cases were treated with cefixime, the resistant strain had a net fitness advantage over the susceptible strain. Limitations include sparse data leading to large intervals on key model parameters and necessary assumptions in the modelling of a complex epidemiological process.Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first estimates of the fitness cost and benefit associated with resistance of the gonococcus to a clinically relevant antibiotic. Our findings have important implications for antibiotic stewardship and public health policies and, in particular, suggest that a previously abandoned antibiotic could be used again to treat a minority of gonorrhoea cases without raising resistance levels.",

    "articleAbstract": "Vocal learning, the substrate of human language acquisition, has rarely been described in other mammals. Often, group-specific vocal dialects in wild populations provide the main evidence for vocal learning. While social learning is often the most plausible explanation for these intergroup differences, it is usually impossible to exclude other driving factors, such as genetic or ecological backgrounds. Here, we show the formation of dialects through social vocal learning in fruit bats under controlled conditions. We raised 3 groups of pups in conditions mimicking their natural roosts. Namely, pups could hear their mothers' vocalizations but were also exposed to a manipulation playback. The vocalizations in the 3 playbacks mainly differed in their fundamental frequency. From the age of approximately 6 months and onwards, the pups demonstrated distinct dialects, where each group was biased towards its playback. We demonstrate the emergence of dialects through social learning in a mammalian model in a tightly controlled environment. Unlike in the extensively studied case of songbirds where specific tutors are imitated, we demonstrate that bats do not only learn their vocalizations directly from their mothers, but that they are actually influenced by the sounds of the entire crowd. This process, which we term \"crowd vocal learning,\" might be relevant to many other social animals such as cetaceans and pinnipeds.",

    "articleAbstract": "MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant approved for human influenza vaccination in European Union. The mode of action of MF59 is not fully elucidated yet, but results from several years of investigation indicate that MF59 establishes an immunocompetent environment at injection site which promotes recruitment of immune cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs), that are facilitated to engulf antigen and transport it to draining lymph node (dLN) where the antigen is accumulated. In vitro studies showed that MF59 promotes the differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Since after immunization with MF59, monocytes are rapidly recruited both at the injection site and in dLN and appear to have a morphological change toward a DC-like phenotype, we asked whether MF59 could play a role in inducing differentiation of Mo-DC in vivo. To address this question we immunized mice with the auto-fluorescent protein Phycoerythrin (PE) as model antigen, in presence or absence of MF59. We measured the APC phenotype and their antigen uptake within dLNs, the antigen distribution within the dLN compartments and the humoral response to PE. In addition, using Ovalbumin as model antigen, we measured the capacity of dLN APCs to induce antigen-specific CD4 T cell proliferation. Here, we show, for the first time, that MF59 promotes differentiation of Mo-DCs within dLNs from intranodal recruited monocytes and we suggest that this differentiation could take place in the medullary compartment of the LN. In addition we show that the Mo-DC subset represents the major source of antigen-loaded and activated APCs within the dLN when immunizing with MF59. Interestingly, this finding correlates with the enhanced triggering of antigen-specific CD4 T cell response induced by LN APCs. This study therefore demonstrates that MF59 is able to promote an immunocompetent environment also directly within the dLN, offering a novel insight on the mechanism of action of vaccine adjuvants based on emulsions.",

Survival estimates were calculated by use of Kaplan-Meier (KM) and multivariable Cox regression models.1,331 pts were included (465 HIV-L, 866 nHIV-L): 909 (68%) NHL, 422 (32%) HL. 3 years-cumulative probability (95% confidence interval, CI) of death was higher in HIV-L compared to nHIV-L in NHL (38% (33-44) vs. 22% (19-26); p<0.001), and HL (22% [15-29] vs. 10% (6-13), p<0.001). Among HL, HIV was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.37 [95% CI: 1.24-4.55], p = 0.009) independently of calendar year, age, gender, type of chemotherapy and stage; in NHL, HIV was no longer an independent predictor of death after controlling for rituximab use and IPI (HR = 1.26 (0.97-1.63), p = 0.08).Our analysis shows a reduced overall survival in HIV+ patients diagnosed with lymphoma compared to HIV-negative controls. Whereas in HIV people with HL, the increased risk of death was confirmed even after adjustment for main confounders, the association between HIV status and survival in NHL appears to be somewhat attenuated after controlling for more aggressive presentation and lower frequency of rituximab use in HIV-+ people.",

We examined the independent association between serum vitamin D and PTH with multiple subclinical markers of atherosclerosis.A total of 8,217 subjects who participated in the Dong-gu Study in Korea were included in the final analysis. The carotid artery structure, including intima-media thickness (IMT), plaques, and luminal diameter, was evaluated using a high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. The brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was determined using an automatic waveform analysis device, and the mean of the left and right baPWV was used.The PTH concentration was positively associated with carotid luminal diameter and baPWV, but not with carotid IMT and plaques. The mean carotid luminal diameter of individuals with PTH levels in the second, third, and fourth quartiles was significantly larger compared with those in the first quartile (P-trend < 0.01). The mean baPWV of individuals with PTH levels in the fourth quartile was significantly greater than those with PTH levels in the first quartile (P-trend = 0.01). However, there was no significant association between vitamin D and any atherosclerotic phenotypes, including carotid IMT, plaques, luminal diameter, and baPWV.This suggests that PTH might affect the development of atherosclerosis by altering vascular compliance.",

    "articleAbstract": "In species that require parental care, each parent can either care for their offspring or leave them in the care of the other parent. For each parent this creates three possible parental care strategies: biparental care, uniparental (male or female) care, and uniparental desertion by either the male or female. The burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis, typically exhibits biparental care of offspring, and thus provides a unique system that allows us to compare the fitness benefits of these parental care strategies in an unconfounded way. In this study, we assess the lifetime fitness of biparental care, uniparental care, and uniparental desertion strategies in both male and female N. orbicollis. Specifically, we tested for increased fitness of the biparental care strategy compared to uniparental care strategies. Second, we test for equality of fitness between uniparental care and uniparental desertion strategies. Surprisingly, biparental care yields lower lifetime fitness for both parents compared to the other two strategies. Also, uniparental care and uniparental desertion strategies yielded equal fitness. The evolution of biparental care in this system is not consistent with the expectation of a mutual fitness benefit. We discuss other potential explanations for the evolution of biparental care in this system.",

    "articleAbstract": "Malaria causes about half a million deaths annually, with Plasmodium falciparum being responsible for 90% of all the cases. Recent reports on artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia warrant urgent discovery of novel drugs for the treatment of malaria. However, most bioactive compounds fail to progress to treatments due to safety concerns. Drug repositioning offers an alternative strategy where drugs that have already been approved as safe for other diseases could be used to treat malaria. This study screened approved drugs for antimalarial activity using an in silico chemogenomics approach prior to in vitro verification. All the P. falciparum proteins sequences available in NCBI RefSeq were mined and used to perform a similarity search against DrugBank, TTD and STITCH databases to identify similar putative drug targets. Druggability indices of the potential P. falciparum drug targets were obtained from TDR targets database. Functional amino acid residues of the drug targets were determined using ConSurf server which was used to fine tune the similarity search. This study predicted 133 approved drugs that could target 34 P. falciparum proteins. A literature search done at PubMed and Google Scholar showed 105 out of the 133 drugs to have been previously tested against malaria, with most showing activity. For further validation, drug susceptibility assays using SYBR Green I method were done on a representative group of 10 predicted drugs, eight of which did show activity against P. falciparum 3D7 clone. Seven had IC50 values ranging from 1 μM to 50 μM. This study also suggests drug-target association and hence possible mechanisms of action of drugs that did show antiplasmodial activity. The study results validate the use of proteome-wide target similarity approach in identifying approved drugs with activity against P. falciparum and could be adapted for other pathogens.",

    "articleAbstract": "Naïve CD4 T (NCD4T) cells post-activation undergo programming for inducible production of cytokines leading to generation of memory cells with various functions. Based on cytokine based polarization of NCD4T cells in vitro, programming for either 'Th1' (interferon-gamma [IFNg]) or 'Th2' (interleukin [IL]-4/5/13) cytokines is thought to occur via mutually exclusive expression and functioning of T-bet or GATA-3 transcription factors (TFs). However, we show that a high proportion of mouse and human memory-phenotype CD4 T (MCD4T) cells generated in vivo which expressed either Th1 or Th2 cytokines commonly co-expressed T-bet and GATA-3. While T-bet levels did not differ between IFNg-expressing and IL-4/5/13-expressing MCD4T cells, GATA-3 levels were higher in the latter. These observations were also confirmed in MCD4T cells from FVB/NJ or aged C57BL/6 or IFNg-deficient mice. While MCD4T cells from these strains showed greater Th2 commitment than those from young C57BL/6 mice, pattern of co-expression of TF was similar. Effector T cells generated in vivo following immunization also showed TF co-expression in Th1 or Th2 cytokine producing cells. We speculated that the difference in TF expression pattern of MCD4T cells generated in vivo and those generated in cytokine polarized cultures in vitro could be due to relative absence of polarizing conditions during activation in vivo. We tested this by NCD4T cell activation in non-polarizing conditions in vitro. Anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-mediated priming of polyclonal NCD4T cells in vitro without polarizing milieu generated cells that expressed either IFNg or IL-4/5/13 but not both, yet both IFNg- and IL-4/5/13-expressing cells showed upregulation of both TFs. We also tested monoclonal T cell populations activated in non-polarizing conditions. TCR-transgenic NCD4T cells primed in vitro by cognate peptide in non-polarizing conditions which expressed either IFNg or IL-4/5/13 also showed a high proportion of cells co-expressing TFs, and their cytokine commitment varied depending on genetic background or priming conditions, without altering pattern of TF co-expression. Thus, the model of mutually antagonistic differentiation programs driven by mutually exclusively expressed T-bet or GATA-3 does not completely explain natural CD4 T cell priming outcomes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is disproportionally concentrated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the odds of dying from TBI in Uganda more than 4 times higher than in high income countries (HICs). The objectives of this study are to describe the processes of care and determine risk factors predictive of poor outcomes for TBI patients presenting to Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH), Kampala, Uganda.We used a prospective neurosurgical registry based on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to systematically collect variables spanning 8 categories. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to determine significant predictors of mortality.563 TBI patients were enrolled from 1 June- 30 November 2016. 102 patients (18%) received surgery, 29 patients (5.1%) intended for surgery failed to receive it, and 251 patients (45%) received non-operative management. Overall mortality was 9.6%, which ranged from 4.7% for mild and moderate TBI to 55% for severe TBI patients with GCS 3-5. Within each TBI severity category, mortality differed by management pathway. Variables predictive of mortality were TBI severity, more than one intracranial bleed, failure to receive surgery, high dependency unit admission, ventilator support outside of surgery, and hospital arrival delayed by more than 4 hours.The overall mortality rate of 9.6% in Uganda for TBI is high, and likely underestimates the true TBI mortality. Furthermore, the wide-ranging mortality (3-82%), high ICU fatality, and negative impact of care delays suggest shortcomings with the current triaging practices. Lack of surgical intervention when needed was highly predictive of mortality in TBI patients. Further research into the determinants of surgical interventions, quality of step-up care, and prolonged care delays are needed to better understand the complex interplay of variables that affect patient outcome. These insights guide the development of future interventions and resource allocation to improve patient outcomes.",

The device under test (DUT) is measured twice with different modulation schemes. By post-processing the measurement results, the response of the DUT can be obtained accurately. Since DSB modulation is used in our approach, the measurement range is doubled compared with conventional single-sideband (SSB) modulation-based OVNA. Moreover, the measurement accuracy is improved by eliminating the even-order sidebands. The key advantage of the proposed scheme is that the measurement of a DUT with bandpass response can also be simply realized, which is a big challenge for the SSB-based OVNA. The proposed method is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated.",

In particular, in the given structure, topology transitions from standard closed forms of spheres and ellipsoids to open ones of Type I and Type II hyperboloids as well as bi-hyperboloids were revealed and analyzed. In the latter case, it is found out that a complex of an ellipsoid and bi-hyperboloid in isofrequency surfaces appears as a simultaneous effect of both the ratio between magnetic and semiconductor filling factors and magnetic field influence.

    "articleAbstract": "We present a mutual compensation scheme of three phase fluctuations, originating from the residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in the phase modulation process, in the bright squeezed light generation system. The influence of the RAM on each locking loop is harmonized by using one electro-optic modulator (EOM), and the direction of the phase fluctuation is manipulated by positioning the photodetector (PD) that extracts the error signal before or after the optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Therefore a bright squeezed light with non-classical noise reduction of π is obtained. By fitting the squeezing and antisqueezing measurement results, we confirm that the total phase fluctuation of the system is around 3.1 mrad. The fluctuation of the noise suppression is 0.2 dB for 3 h.",

The proposed microphotonic concept provides a promising alternative mid-infrared source and paves the way towards novel optical gas sensing platforms for many applications.",

We also reveal the impact of the AlN composition in the AlGaN quantum barrier on the carrier injection for the studied LEDs. We find that, by properly increasing the AlN composition, both the electron and hole concentrations in the multiple quantum wells (MQWs) are enhanced. We attribute the increased electron concentration to the better electron confinement within the MQW region when increasing the AlN composition for the AlGaN barrier. The improved hole concentration in the MQW region is ascribed to the reduced hole blocking effect by the p-type electron blocking layer (p-EBL). This is enabled by the reduced density of the polarization-induced positive charges at the AlGaN last quantum barrier (LB)/p-EBL interface, which correspondingly suppresses the hole depletion at the AlGaN LB/p-EBL interface and decreases the valence band barrier height for the p-EBL. As a result, the optical power is improved.",

    "articleAbstract": "Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) via optical fibers makes use of Rayleigh backscattering for the detection of acoustic waves that interact with the fiber along its entire length. The random nature of Rayleigh backscattering leads to nonuniform performance along the fiber and, occasionally, to complete signal fading. In addition, distance-dependent signal-to-noise (SNR) degradation is always present due to propagation loss. In contrast, using arrays of discrete reflectors [such as weak fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) with equal center wavelengths] offers deterministic performance which can be designed to be uniform along the fiber. Here we describe an approach for implementing Rayleigh-based discrete reflectors that can offer enhanced detection performance in selected regions. It is based on enclosing sections of the fiber in acoustically insulated boxes to create lumped Rayleigh reflectors. Besides diminishing the randomness in detection sensitivity, the method enables increasing the detection SNR far beyond the typical value for Rayleigh-based DAS and obtaining sensitivities comparable with discrete reflectors. The proposed method was successfully tested via both simulation and experiment.",

X4, 021003 (2014)PRXHAE2160-330810.1103/PhysRevX.4.021003] which are almost degenerate in a two-dimensional (2-D) structure and non-degenerate in a three-dimensional (3-D) structure, and with the magnetic dipole appearing at higher frequency. They are described as spoof localized plasmonic modes analogous to localized plasmonic resonances in optical frequencies. Here, we consider a hollow metal cylinder corrugated by periodic cut-through slits. Our results indicate that the magnetic dipole can be separated from the electric dipole in a 2-D structure, and magnetic dipolar resonance appears at lower frequency, rather than electric resonance in both 2-D and 3-D structures. In order to clarify the physical mechanism behind the abnormal phenomenon, we study the influence of the core material on the electric- and magnetic-dipole modes based on theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. It is discovered that there is a threshold of an imaginary part of permittivity for switching the order between electric and magnetic dipoles. These results may provide fundamental understanding and physical insight for spoof plasmonic modes supported in designer structures.",

    "articleAbstract": "We report on the switchable generation of a rectangular noise-like pulse (NLP) and a dissipative soliton resonance (DSR) in a fiber laser with highly nonlinear effect at very low pump power. The NLP centered at 1530.5 nm demonstrates a new characteristic that its profile evolves gradually from rectangular shape to Gaussian-like shape with the increasing pump power. By appropriately manipulating the polarization controller (PC), the laser switches emit a DSR pulse centered at 1551.3 nm. The duration of the DSR could broaden from 17.4 ns to the cavity round trip time with increasing the pump power, while keeping the pulse profile and the intensity unaltered. This type of fiber laser may not only facilitate further investigations of the characteristics of NLP and DSR but also serve as a multi-functional optical source for potential applications.",

This dependence observed for phase-separated glasses and glass-ceramics is described by the power law with the constant exponent (-p), where p is greater than 4. In the approach, the material is modeled by identical Rayleigh scatterers distributed in a homogeneous matrix. We use this model, the interference approximation for a scattering coefficient and its experimental wavelength dependence, and express the asymmetry parameter in terms of p. The results can be applied to the simulation of multiple light scattering in nanomaterials.",

Sensitized by the Bi(3+) codopants, it exhibits intense NIR PersL of Yb(3+) at about 1000 nm. In addition, this phosphor can be excited by the near ultraviolet and even visible light, and the PersL signals can be recorded for more than 80 h. The PersL enhancement by Bi(3+) is revealed to be due to the suitable Bi(3+) induced deeper traps and the possible PersL quantum cutting. The results suggest that the NIR PersL of the CaTiO3:Yb(3+), Bi(3+) phosphor has potential applications for biomedical imaging in the second biological window.",

A 2 mW laser at 1550 nm is utilized to modulate the amplitude and frequency of a quantum cascade laser, and the associated amplitude modulation (AM) is suppressed by a 1.85 mW laser at 850 nm. Due to the hot carrier effect and the increment of electron temperature, the AM has been decreased. In addition, the free carrier concentration increases in the active region due to the two NIR illuminations, which enhance the FM. Purified FM is beneficial in improving the signal fidelity for free-space optical communication and high-speed FM spectroscopy.",

    "articleAbstract": "Plasma deposition techniques like ion-beam-sputtering (IBS) are state of the art to manufacture high quality optical components for laser applications. Besides the well optimized process and monitoring systems, the coating material selection is integral to achieve optimum optical performances. Applying the IBS technology, an approach is presented to create novel materials by the direct application of binary oxides in a quantizing structure. By reducing the physical thickness of the high refractive index material to a few nm, within a classical high-low index stack, the electron confinement can be changed. Optical characterizations of the manufactured samples with decreasing quantum well thicknesses result in an increasing blue shift of the absorption gap and offer a method to approximate the effective mass of the high refractive index material in conjunction with theoretical models. Laser-induced damage threshold tests of coating samples prepared with different well thicknesses indicate an increase of the measured threshold values with optical gap energy.",

By varying arm lengths of the cross resonators, we obtained a full 2π phase coverage with high transmission at target frequency. The fabricated metalens was experimentally demonstrated to focus a continuous THz beam to a spot with a full width at half-maximum of 630 μm at a focal length of 28 mm, which agrees well with the theoretical calculation. This device has potential for applications in THz imaging and communications, and our work can also easily be extended in the design of other planar THz components, such as beam deflectors or vortex plates.",

Some BICs (e.g., antisymmetric standing waves) are symmetry protected, since they have incompatible symmetry with outgoing waves in the radiation channels. The propagating BICs do not have this symmetry mismatch, but they still crucially depend on the symmetry of the structure. In this Letter, a perturbation theory is developed for propagating BICs on two-dimensional periodic structures. The Letter shows that these BICs are robust against structural perturbations that preserve the symmetry, indicating that these BICs, in fact, are implicitly protected by symmetry.",

In this Letter, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we present a fully flexible photoacoustic coupling system (FPACS) that integrates optical fiber bundles and a flexible ultrasonic transducer for morphological-adaptive breast detection. The experimental results show that the system has better resolution and higher energy utilization than traditional PAT systems, even at the edge of the imaging region. Moreover, the system can achieve morphological adaption, suggesting that the FPACS provides the potential for clinical routine breast screening.",

Analogous to time signals, which can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal frequency functions, a light beam can also be decomposed into a set of spatial modes that are taken from an orthogonal basis. Such decomposition can potentially provide a tool for spatial spectrum analysis, which may enable stable, accurate, and robust extraction of physical object information that may not be readily achievable using traditional approaches. As a proof-of-concept example, we measure an object's opening angle using orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) -based complex spectrum, achieving a >15  dB signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the dip (i.e., notch) positions of the OAM intensity spectrum are dependent on an object's opening angle but independent of the opening's angular orientation, whereas the slope of the OAM phase spectrum is dependent on the opening's orientation but independent of the opening angle.",

    "articleAbstract": "As a kind of two-dimensional metamaterial, metasurfaces can modify the amplitude, phase, and polarization of the transmitted or reflected electromagnetic wave, and thereby can be used for enhancing the light-matter interactions. Based on this notion, an optical magnetic mirror metasurface featuring periodic nanoscale grooves is designed to confine the strong electric field near the metal surface by magnetic responses. As a result, fluorescence from an ultra-thin layer of fluorescent polymer blend (∼15  nm) on the mirror surface can be strongly enhanced (by 45-fold in experiment). The fluorescence emission can be controlled by the polarization of excitation light since the responses of the magnetic mirror are polarization sensitive. This kind of magnetic mirror metasurface is potentially useful in biological monitors, optical sources, and chemical sensors.",

    "articleAbstract": "We propose a novel and simple in-fiber refractive index sensor based on resonant coupling, constructed by a short section of single eccentric hole-assisted dual-core fiber (SEHADCF) spliced between two single-mode fibers. The coupling characteristics of the SEHADCF are calculated numerically. The strong resonant coupling occurs when the fundamental mode of the center core phase-matches to that of the suspended core in the air hole. The effective refractive index of the fundamental mode of the suspended core can be obviously changed by injecting solution into the air hole. The responses of the proposed devices to the refractive index and temperature are experimentally measured. The refractive index sensitivity is 627.5 nm/refractive index unit in the refractive index range of 1.335-1.385. The sensor without solution filling is insensitive to temperature in the range of 30-90°C. The proposed refractive index sensor has outstanding advantages, such as simple fabrication, good mechanical strength, and excellent microfluidic channel, and will be of importance in biological detection, chemical analysis, and environment monitoring.",

    "articleAbstract": "We demonstrate a novel approach to producing coherent, directional supercontinuum and cascaded dispersive waves using dispersion engineering in waveguides. By pumping in the normal group-velocity dispersion (GVD) regime, with two zero-GVD points to one side of the pump, pulse compression of the first dispersive wave generated in the anomalous GVD region results in the generation of a second dispersive wave beyond the second zero-GVD point in the normal GVD regime. As a result, we achieve an octave-spanning supercontinuum generated primarily to one side of the pump spectrum. We theoretically investigate the dynamics and show that the generated spectrum is highly coherent. We experimentally confirm this dynamical behavior and the coherence properties in silicon nitride waveguides by performing direct detection of the carrier-envelope-offset frequency of our femtosecond pump source using an f-2f interferometer. Our technique offers a path towards a stabilized, high-power, integrated supercontinuum source with low noise and high coherence, with applications including direct comb spectroscopy.",

We formulate and clarify the operating conditions in which we can generate optical combs adding the two important functionalities of spectral shaping: (1) multiplication of frequency spacing and (2) spectral flattening. The frequency spacing of the generated comb is enhanced much higher than the EO modulation bandwidth. The spectral shaping is achieved fully through the EO modulation process without relying on any optical filters. This filter-less configuration is advantageous for flexible tuning of wavelength and frequency spacing of the generated combs. The concept is numerically verified, focusing on N×25-GHz-spaced comb generation.",

The time-division multiplexing technique is used to achieve a calibration-free optical layout. A single piece of detector is used to detect the backscatter signals at two orthogonal states in an alternative sequence. Thus, regular calibration of the two detectors in traditional polarization lidars is avoided. The signal-to-noise ratio of the lidar is guaranteed by using an SNSPD, providing high detection efficiency and low dark count noise. The linear depolarization ratio (LDR) of the urban aerosol is observed horizontally over 48 h in Hefei [N31°50'37'', E117°15'54''], when a heavy air pollution is spreading from the north to the central east of China. Phenomena of LDR bursts are detected at a location where a building is under construction. The lidar results show good agreement with the data detected from a sun photometer, a 532 nm visibility lidar, and the weather forecast information.",

For the single PBS, the bandwidths for an ER≥30  dB are 20 nm for the quasi-TE mode, and 70 nm for the quasi-TM mode when a broadband light source (1520-1610 nm) was employed. The insertion loss (IL) varies from 0.2 to 1 dB for the quasi-TE mode and 0.2-2 dB for the quasi-TM mode. The cascaded PBS improved the bandwidth of the quasi-TE mode for an ER≥30  dB to 90 nm, with a low IL of 0.2-2 dB. To the best of our knowledge, our PBS system is one of the best broadband PBSs with an ER as high as ∼42  dB and a low IL below 1 dB around the central wavelength, and experimentally demonstrated using edge-coupling.",

    "articleAbstract": "We report the first demonstration of a microresonator-based tunable mode-locked frequency comb source. We achieve a mode-hop-free tuning range of 16 GHz by simultaneously tuning both the pump laser and the cavity resonance while keeping the system in a multi-soliton mode-locked state. The optical spectrum spans 2520-4125  cm(-1) (2.425-3.970 μm) pumping at 3508  cm(-1) (2.850 μm) in a silicon microresonator with a comb line spacing of 4.23  cm(-1) (127 GHz). Our scanning technique can be used to increase the effective resolution of the microresonator-based comb spectroscopy. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we record the absorption spectrum of the rovibrational transitions of the υ3 and υ2+(υ4+υ5)+0 bands of acetylene. We measure absorption features as narrow as 0.21  cm(-1) (6.4 GHz) full width at half-maximum at a frequency sampling step of 80 MHz.",

    "articleAbstract": "Optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (ORPAM) represents one of the fastest evolving optical microscopic techniques. However, due to the bulky size and complicated system configuration of conventional ORPAM, it is largely limited to small animal experiments. In this Letter, we present the design and evaluation of a portable ORPAM with a high spatiotemporal resolution and a large field of view. In this system, we utilize a rotatory scanning mechanism instead of the conventional raster scanning to achieve translationless imaging of the probe/samples, making it accessible to the human oral lip and tongue. After phantom evaluation, we applied this system to monitor longitudinal neo-angiogenesis of tumor growth and, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, image the oral vascular network of humans to show its potential in clinical detection of early-stage oral cancer.",

    "articleAbstract": "We demonstrate a novel, single-shot recording technology for transient optical signals. A resolution of 0.4 ps over a record length of 54 ps was demonstrated. Here, a pump pulse crossing through a signal samples a diagonal \"slice\" of space-time, enabling a camera to record spatially the time content of the signal. Unlike related χ((2))-based cross-correlation techniques, here the signal is sampled through optically pumped carriers that modify the refractive index of a silicon wafer. Surrounding the wafer with birefringent retarders enables two time-staggered, orthogonally polarized signal copies to probe the wafer. Recombining the copies at a final crossed polarizer destructively interferes with them, except during the brief stagger window, where a differential phase shift is incurred. This enables the integrating response of the rapidly excited but persistent carriers to be optically differentiated. This sampling mechanism has several advantages that enable scaling to long record lengths, including making use of large, inexpensive semiconductor wafers, eliminating the need for phase matching, broad insensitivity to the spectral and angular properties of the pump, and overall hardware simplicity.",

When the tilt angle changes, the microbubble in the liquid can drift along the upper arc-shaped inwall of the microcavity and stay at a vertex to get a state of mechanical equilibrium. The drifting microbubble induces a drastic change on the optical path difference between the light beams in the microcavity and, consequently, on the reflection spectrum, which makes it a tilt angle sensitive element. The experimental results show that the tilt angle sensitivity is as high as 160.21 nm/deg, and the detection resolution of such a sensor can reach up to 2.3×10(-3)  deg. Moreover, such a fiber tilt sensor is capable of distinguishing the tilt direction, since the movement of the microbubble is tilt direction dependent.",

In combination with fluorescence microscopy, it broadened the knowledge of cell biology at the expense of perturbing the samples with extrinsic fluorescent labels. In contrast, Raman microscopy acquires the molecular fingerprint of the sample without the need of extrinsic labels, and therefore improving its resolution can make an even greater impact. Here, we take advantage of the improved axial resolution of a 4π configuration to form a 4π Raman microscope. With this microscope, we independently and simultaneously analyzed different nanolayers in a multilayer stack. We identified their chemical composition and retrieved their relative subwavelength optical separation with a precision of 6 nm.",

High-power pulses from a nanosecond pulsed fiber master oscillator power amplifier at 1064 nm are combined with 1122 nm of seed light for Raman amplification at the first Stokes order in a standard single-mode fiber. With increasing power, we observe a narrowband spectral component at 1186 nm, without any additional seed or resonator at this wavelength. We analyze this occurrence of a narrowband second Stokes order both experimentally and theoretically and suggest it is a result of FWM seeding of the SRS amplification in the fiber. We demonstrate that the wavelength shifting can be controlled electronically within microseconds for very rapid and even pulse-to-pulse wavelength changes. This wavelength conversion method can extend the spectral coverage of single-wavelength fiber lasers for biomedical imaging.",

Refractive index sensitivities of 200 nm/RIU for aqueous analytes at high fringe contrast levels (-20  dB) have been observed. Our concept presents an easy-to-use, efficient, and multiplex-compatible sensing platform for rapid small-volume detection with the capacity for integration into a bioanalytic, optofluidic, or microfluidic system.",

    "articleAbstract": "We investigate single-channel and multichannel phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) in a highly nonlinear, CMOS-compatible spiral waveguide with ultralow linear and negligible nonlinear losses. We achieve a net gain of 10.4 dB and an extinction ratio of 24.6 dB for single-channel operation, as well as a 5 dB gain and a 15 dB extinction ratio spanning over a bandwidth of 24 nm for multiple-channel operation. In addition, we derive a simple analytic solution that enables calculating the maximum phase-sensitive gain in any Kerr medium featuring linear and nonlinear losses. These results not only give a clear guideline for designing PSA-based amplifiers but also show that it is possible to implement both optical regeneration and amplification in a single on-chip device.",

First, we introduce a simple method to observe the azimuthal (l) and radial (p) indices of the high-order LG modes. Based on the astigmatic transformation technique, l and p are revealed in the number of dark stripes of the converted pattern in the focal plane. Then, using this efficient method of measurement, we demonstrate in experiments a second-harmonic LG mode with its radial and azimuthal indices being twice those of the inputted fundamental wave through QPM in a periodically poled KTP crystal. Our results provide a feasible way to obtain simultaneously the LG modes with larger radial and azimuthal indices.",

Assisted by the particle swarm optimization algorithm, we search for an optimal curvature-controlled multi-segment taper that maintains width continuity. Counterintuitively, the optimization yields a structure with abrupt width discontinuity and width compression features. Through spatial phase and parameterized analysis, a semi-lens feature is revealed that helps to flatten the wavefront at the output end for higher coupling efficiency. Such functionality cannot be achieved by normal tapers in a short distance. The structure is fabricated and characterized experimentally. By a figure of merit that accounts for expansion ratio, length, and efficiency, this structure outperforms an adiabatic taper by 9 times.",

In this Letter, taking inspiration from super-resolution imaging techniques developed to beat the optical diffraction limit, we demonstrate that the localization of individual optical absorbers can provide super-resolution photoacoustic imaging well beyond the acoustic diffraction limit. As a proof-of-principle experiment, photoacoustic cross-sectional images of microfluidic channels were obtained with a 15 MHz linear capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer array, while absorbing beads were flown through the channels. The localization of individual absorbers allowed us to obtain a super-resolved cross-sectional image of the channels by reconstructing both the channel width and position with an accuracy better than λ/10. Given the discrete nature of endogenous absorbers such as red blood cells, or that of exogenous particular contrast agents, localization is a promising approach to push the current resolution limits of photoacoustic imaging.",

    "articleAbstract": "In this Letter, a compact spectrometer based on upconversion and downconversion luminescence for operation in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet bands is presented. The proposed spectrometer has three components that are used for dispersion, frequency conversion, and detection. The conversion component converts the incident signal beam into a spectral window appropriate for the detection component. The detection component images the speckle pattern generated by scattering or diffraction in the random structure of the dispersion component. With the two-dimensional intensity data captured from both the speckle pattern and a calibration measurement process, one can reconstruct the spectra of the signal beam by solving a matrix equation. A smoothing simulated annealing algorithm has been implemented to improve the accuracy of the spectral reconstruction. We have analyzed possible sources of error in the algorithm and the corresponding limits of operation. The reported broadband, compact, high-resolution, luminescence-based spectrometer is well suited for portable spectroscopy applications.",

We apply the RTOF multi-port to show that the optical force expression on these devices can be extended to analyze multiple light sources, broadband sources, and multimode devices, with multiple degrees of freedom. We also show that the DR method, when expressed as a function of the derivative of the effective index performed at a fixed wave vector, may be misinterpreted and lead to overestimated results.",

    "articleAbstract": "Elliptical-core few mode fiber (EC-FMF) is used in a mode division multiplexing (MDM) transmission system to release multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) digital-signal-processing, which reduces the cost and the complexity of the receiver. However, EC-FMF does not match with conventional multiplexers/de-multiplexers (MUXs/DeMUXs) such as a photonic lantern, leading to extra mode coupling loss and crosstalk. We design elliptical-core mode-selective photonic lanterns (EC-MSPLs) with six modes, which can match well with EC-FMF in MIMO-free MDM systems. Simulation of the EC-MSPL using the beam propagation method was demonstrated employing a combination of either step-index or graded-index fibers with six different sizes of cores, and the taper transition length of 8 cm or 4 cm. Through numerical simulations and optimizations, both types of photonic lanterns can realize low loss transmission and low crosstalk of below -20.0  dB for all modes.",

    "articleAbstract": "589 nm lasers pulsed at Larmor frequency, several hundreds of kilohertz, can increase the brightness of a sodium guide star and are required in remote magnetometry with mesospheric sodium. By amplification of a continuous-wave single-frequency 1178 nm laser in a pulse-pumped Raman fiber amplifier and frequency doubling in an external cavity, high-power pulsed 589 nm laser at Larmor frequency is obtained for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. The pulse format is mainly determined by the 1120 nm Raman pump laser, whose pulse repetition rate and duty cycle are adjustable. Active pulse shaping is applied to minimize the relaxation spike at the leading edge of the pulses. A reduction in pulse width and conversion efficiency from 1120 to 1178 nm is observed in the backwardly pumped Raman fiber amplifier due to the pump pulse transition effect. A 589 nm laser pulsed at a 350 kHz repetition rate and 20% duty cycle with average power up to 17 W is demonstrated as an operation example intended for a geomagnetic field of 0.5 G.",

It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that controlled modulation of the spatial polarization distribution of laser speckle can be achieved by proper choice of the polarization states as well as the average spatial intensity of the constituent speckles. It is shown that the proposed technique is useful to generate different speckle patterns with sinusoidal variation in their degree of polarization, which can be tuned from zero to unity. This technique can find application in sensing, biomedical studies, and in determining the rotation of an electric field vector after passing through a scattering medium.",

Near-field optics is a unique imaging tool that provides optical images with resolution down to tens of nanometers. One of the main limitations of this technology is its low light sensitivity. The presented hybrid probe solves this problem by combining a campanile plasmonic probe with the photonic layer, consisting of the diffractive optic element (DOE). The DOE is designed to match the plasmonic field at the broad side of the campanile probe with the fiber mode. This makes it possible to optimize the size of the campanile tip to convert light efficiently into the hot spot. The simulations show that the hybrid probe is ∼540 times more efficient compared with the conventional campanile on average in the 600-900 nm spectral range.",

    "articleAbstract": "High-speed Raman spectroscopy has become increasingly important for analyzing chemical dynamics in real time. To address the need, rapid-scan Fourier-transform coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (FT-CARS) spectroscopy has been developed to realize broadband CARS measurements at a scan rate of more than 20,000 scans/s. However, the detection sensitivity of FT-CARS spectroscopy is inherently low due to the limited number of photons detected during each scan. In this Letter, we show our experimental demonstration of enhanced sensitivity in rapid-scan FT-CARS spectroscopy by heterodyne detection. Specifically, we implemented heterodyne detection by superposing the CARS electric field with an external local oscillator (LO) for their interference. The CARS signal was amplified by simply increasing the power of the LO without the need for increasing the incident power onto the sample. Consequently, we achieved enhancement in signal intensity and the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of 39 and 5, respectively, compared to FT-CARS spectroscopy with homodyne detection. The sensitivity-improved rapid-scan FT-CARS spectroscopy is expected to enable the sensitive real-time observation of chemical dynamics in a broad range of settings, such as combustion engines and live biological cells.",

The interference is performed by flipping the relative position of a sample and reference beam, and the two-wavelength information is spatially multiplexed onto a monochromatic charge-coupled device camera simultaneously using polarization modulation. Due to the interferogram containing two-wavelength information with orthogonal interference fringes, the two-wavelength unwrapped information on the phase and thickness for the sample is extracted from a single shot.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of both a UV spectrometer and a nanometer resolution spectrometer based on smartphone sensor technology. The device performance was assessed and validated by measuring column amounts of SO2 within quartz cells with a differential optical absorption spectroscopy processing routine. This system could easily be reconfigured to cover other UV-visible-near-infrared spectral regions, as well as alternate spectral ranges and/or linewidths. Hence, our intention is also to highlight how this framework could be applied to build bespoke, low-cost, spectrometers for a range of scientific applications.",

    "articleAbstract": "The evanescent field surrounding nanoscale optical waveguides offers an efficient interface between light and mesoscopic ensembles of neutral atoms. However, the thermal motion of trapped atoms, combined with the strong radial gradients of the guided light, leads to a time-modulated coupling between atoms and the light mode, thus giving rise to additional noise and motional dephasing of collective states. Here, we present a dipole force free scheme for coupling of the radial motional states, utilizing the strong intensity gradient of the guided mode and demonstrate all-optical coupling of the cesium hyperfine ground states and motional sideband transitions. We utilize this to prolong the trap lifetime of an atomic ensemble by Raman sideband cooling of the radial motion which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been demonstrated in nano-optical structures previously. This Letter points towards full and independent control of internal and external atomic degrees of freedom using guided light modes only.",

The deducted thermal load and the transversal mode instability (TMI) threshold of a commercial large mode area fiber with 25 μm core and 400 μm cladding were measured at various seed wavelengths. By matching these results with detailed simulations we show that photodarkening has a negligible impact on the thermal load and, therefore, on the TMI threshold in this fiber.",

A recent technology that allows the cleaving of transparent materials via non-ablative processes is based on focusing and translating a high-intensity laser beam within a material to induce a well-defined internal stress plane. This then enables material separation without debris generation. Here, we use a non-diffracting beam engineered to have a transverse elliptical spatial profile to generate high-aspect-ratio elliptical channels in glass of a dimension 350  nm×710  nm and subsequent cleaved surface uniformity at the sub-micron level.",

    "articleAbstract": "A versatile infrared imager capable of imaging the near-visible to the extended short-wavelength infrared (e-SWIR) is demonstrated using e-SWIR InAs/GaSb/AlSb type-II superlattice-based photodiodes. A bi-layer etch-stop scheme consisting of bulk InAs0.91Sb0.09 and AlAs0.1Sb0.9/GaSb superlattice layers is introduced for substrate removal from the hybridized back-side illuminated photodetectors. The implementation of this new technique on an e-SWIR focal plane array results in a significant enhancement in the external quantum efficiency (QE) in the 1.8-0.8 μm spectral region, while maintaining a high QE at wavelengths longer than 1.8 μm. Test pixels exhibit 100% cutoff wavelengths of ∼2.1 and ∼2.25  μm at 150 and 300 K, respectively. They achieve saturated QE values of 56% and 68% at 150 and 300 K, respectively, under back-side illumination and without any anti-reflection coating. At 150 K, the photodetectors (27  μm×27  μm area) exhibit a dark current density of 4.7×10(-7)  A/cm(2) under a -50  mV applied bias providing a specific detectivity of 1.77×10(12)  cm·Hz(1/2)/W. At 300 K, the dark current density reaches 6.6×10(-2)  A/cm(2) under -50  mV bias, providing a specific detectivity of 5.17×10(9)  cm·Hz(1/2)/W.",

Without special preventive measures, plasma formation during operation of XPAL is unavoidable. Recent advancements in the availability of reliable data for electron impact collisions with atoms and molecules have enabled development of a complete reaction mechanism to investigate XPAL-induced plasmas. We report on pathways leading to plasma formation in an Ar/C2H6/Cs XPAL sustained at different cell temperatures. We find that depending on the operating conditions, the contribution of electron impact processes can be as little as bringing the excitation of Cs(P2) states to higher level Cs(**) states, and can be as high as bringing Cs(P2) excited states to a full ionization. Increasing the input pumping power or cell temperature, or decreasing the C2H6 mole fraction leads to electron impact processes dominating in plasma formation over the energy pooling mechanisms previously reported in literature.",

The single-mode laser is subject to optical feedback in the long-cavity regime. In every round-trip time τ, the feedback is found to switch the laser from a stable state to a periodic state. The stable state corresponds to a continuous-wave emission at a single optical frequency. The periodic state corresponds to emission at another optical frequency with sidebands generated from a sustained relaxation oscillation. Such regular switching between the stable and periodic states is first unveiled numerically. Experimentally, the resultant intensity time series is confirmed as comprising of a square-wave envelope repeating in τ, which is modulated on a microwave carrier near the relaxation resonance frequency. Additionally, the duty cycle for the periodic state is found as continuously tunable by adjusting the feedback strength. The tunable state switching is applicable to square-wave modulated photonic microwave generation.",

With a radius of curvature of 50 μm and four spatial oscillations along the (110) average direction, a splitting of the second-harmonic spectrum occurs around the phase-matching wavelength of the corresponding straight waveguide. This splitting, which increases as the radius of curvature decreases, provides a useful degree of freedom for the design of small-footprint nonlinear photonic devices on-chip.",

However, existing optical imaging methods have limitations on mapping pathological evolution in the whole mouse brain. Previous research indicated endogenous fluorescence contrast of senile plaques. Therefore, we develop cryo-micro-optical sectioning tomography (cryo-MOST) to capture intrinsic fluorescence distribution of senile plaques at a micrometer-level resolution in the whole brain. Validation using immunofluorescence demonstrates the capacity of cryo-MOST to visualize and distinguish senile plaques with competent sensitivity and spatial resolution. Compared with imaging in room temperature, cryo-MOST provides better signal intensity and signal-to-noise ratio. Using cryo-MOST, we obtained whole-brain coronal distribution of senile plaques in a transgenic mouse without exogenous dye. Capable of label-free brainwide visualization of Alzheimer's pathology, cryo-MOST may be potentially useful for understanding neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and evaluating drug efficacy.",

    "articleAbstract": "In this Letter, high-quality WS2 film and MoS2 film were vertically stacked on the tip of a single-mode fiber in turns to form heterostructure (WS2-MoS2-WS2)-based saturable absorbers with all-fiber integrated features. Their nonlinear saturable absorption properties were remarkable, such as a large modulation depth (∼16.99%) and a small saturable intensity (6.23  MW·cm(-2)). Stable pulses at 1.55 μm with duration as short as 296 fs and average power as high as 25 mW were obtained in an erbium-doped fiber laser system. The results demonstrate that the proposed heterostructures own remarkable nonlinear optical properties and offer a platform for adjusting nonlinear optical properties by stacking different transition-metal dichalcogenides or modifying the thickness of each layer, paving the way for engineering functional ultrafast photonics devices with desirable properties.",

The mid-wavelength channel exhibited a saturated quantum efficiency of 34% at 4 μm under +200  mV bias voltage in a front-side illumination configuration and without any antireflection coating. At 200 mV, the device exhibited a dark current density of 8.7×10(-5)  A/cm(2) providing a specific detectivity of ∼2×10(11)  cm·Hz(1/2)/W at 150 K. The short-wavelength channel achieved a saturated quantum efficiency of 20% at 1.8 μm. At -10  mV, the device's dark current density was 5.5×10(-8)  A/cm(2).

    "articleAbstract": "Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is applied to improve the performance of polarization insensitive four-wave mixing (FWM) realized with two orthogonal pumps. By manipulating the phase matching condition with SBS-induced phase change, we achieve conversion efficiency improvement up to 6 dB with negligible polarization dependence. Our approach is implemented in a coherent communication system where polarization division multiplexing (PDM) quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal is applied. The quality of the converted idler is evaluated in both back-to-back (BtB) and transmission systems. Our experimental results show that the converted signal enjoys an improved conversion efficiency with negligible polarization-induced distortion. The SBS-enhanced Q factor leads to an extension of the transmission distance by 240 km. The results indicate that SBS-enhanced FWM can accommodate the advanced modulation formats and multiplexing schemes in today's optical networks.",

    "articleAbstract": "For convenient measurements in many applications, wavelength alterations should be translated to the change in intensity of the output light. In this Letter, a novel method based on monitoring the Moiré pattern using a simple dispersive planoconvex lens (chromatic aberration) for wavelength alteration measurement is reported. Due to the chromatic aberration of the lens, different wavelengths have different magnifications. This causes rotation in the Moiré pattern when the wavelength of the incident light is changed. It is shown that by measuring this rotation it is possible to measure the wavelength alterations. The experimental results obtained from four different laser sources with 450, 532, 630, and 632.8 nm wavelengths show total Moiré pattern rotation of about 31.5°, which shows good theory-experimental agreement. This method is simple and more reliable, and might find wide applications in spectrometry, optical sensors, and dispersion measurements.",

One of them, as the object, transmits through a THz EO crystal with THz phase modulation, while the other goes through the crystal without any phase imposed by target the THz field as the reference. The co-axial propagation of the pulse pair can effectively reduce the noises due to mechanical vibrations, air turbulences, and temperature fluctuations in the traditional non-common-path spectral interferometers. Our experiments show that, for a given target THz pulse field, the measured THz signals in a single-shot mode have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 41.2 with our THz common-path spectral interferometer, but 7.91 with a THz Mach-Zehnder spectral interferometer; thus, our design improves the SNR of the THz signal by about 5.2 times.",

We report important differences in the impact of the feedback when applied to the ground or excited state, and observe regimes for which a significant reduction in RIN is achieved.

Moreover, a comparison study is conducted to investigate the effectiveness of both the conventional laser spot source and the IOMZ interferometer-based laser source.

The SWG is introduced to provide an optical waveguide which has much higher birefringence than a regular 340-nm-thick SOI nanowire, so that it is possible to make the phase-matching condition satisfied for TE polarization only in the present design when the waveguide dimensions are optimized. Meanwhile, there is a significant phase mismatching for TM polarization automatically. In this way, the present ADC enables strong polarization selectivity to realize a PBS that separates TE and TM polarizations to the cross and through ports, respectively. The realized PBS has a length of ∼2  μm for the coupling region. For the fabricated PBS, the extinction ratio (ER) is 15-30 dB and the excess loss is 0.2-2.6 dB for TE polarization while the ER is 20-27 dB and the excess loss is 0.3-2.8 dB for TM polarization when operating in the wavelength range of 1520-1580 nm.",

    "articleAbstract": "Over the past decade, it has become nearly routine to sequence genomes of individual microbial cells directly isolated from environmental samples ranging from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to insect guts, providing a powerful complement to shotgun metagenomics in microbial community studies. In this review, we address the technical aspects and challenges of single-cell genome sequencing and discuss some of the scientific endeavors that it has enabled. Specifically, we highlight newly added leaves and branches in the genomic tree of bacterial and archaeal life and illustrate the unique and exciting advantages that single-cell genomics offers over metagenomics, both now and in the near future.",

    "articleAbstract": "BACKGROUND To examine the effects of the addition of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into bilayer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds on the reconstruction of osteochondral defects in a rabbit model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Porous PLGA scaffolds were prepared in a bilayered manner to reflect the structure of chondral and subchondral bone. Bone defects, measuring 4 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness, were created in both knee joints in 18 healthy New Zealand white rabbits, aged between 120-180 days old. Rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: rabbits with bone defects implanted with bilayer PLGA scaffolds (PLGA group) (N=6); or with bilayer PLGA and autologous PRP (PLGA/PRP group) (N=6); and the untreated group (control group) (N=6). The gross morphology, histology, and immunohistochemistry for the expression of collagen type II and aggrecan were observed at 12 weeks after surgery and compared using a scoring system. Micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging and relative expression of specific genes were also assessed. RESULTS The platelet concentrations in the PRP samples were found to be 4.9 times greater than that of whole blood samples. The total score on gross appearance and histology was greatest in the PLGA/PRP group, as was the expression of collagen II and aggrecan of the neo-tissue. Micro-CT imaging showed that more subchondral bone was formed in the PLGA/PRP group. CONCLUSIONS Bilayer PLGA scaffolds loaded with autologous PRP improve the reconstruction of osteochondral defects in the rabbit model.",

    "articleAbstract": "Finding relevant geospatial information is increasingly critical because of the growing volume of geospatial data available within the emerging \"Big Data\" era. Users are expecting that the availability of massive datasets will create more opportunities to uncover hidden information and answer more complex queries. This is especially the case with routing and navigation services where the ability to retrieve points of interest and landmarks make the routing service personalized, precise, and relevant. In this paper, we propose a new geospatial information approach that enables the retrieval of implicit information, i.e., geospatial entities that do not exist explicitly in the available source. We present an information broker that uses a rule-based spatial reasoning algorithm to detect topological relations. The information broker is embedded into a framework where annotations and mappings between OpenStreetMap data attributes and external resources, such as taxonomies, support the enrichment of queries to improve the ability of the system to retrieve information. Our method is tested with two case studies that leads to enriching the completeness of OpenStreetMap data with footway crossing points-of-interests as well as building entrances for routing and navigation purposes. It is concluded that the proposed approach can uncover implicit entities and contribute to extract required information from the existing datasets.",

    "articleAbstract": "The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) explosion in 2010 is the largest oil spill (Macondo) in U.S.We focused on gaining an understanding of the physical health and mental health effects attributable to the Macondo oil spill. This is a report of a cross-sectional cohort study (wave 1) to establish 'baseline' findings and meant to provide descriptive information to be used for a multi-wave, longitudinal study. Gulf Coast Health Alliance: health Risks related to the Macondo Spill (GC-HARMS) uses a Community-Based Participatory Research approach, thus including multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional academic partners and representatives of three communities impacted by the spill. Three research sites were selected for human sampling along the Gulf of Mexico coast including two from Mississippi and one from Louisiana, with Galveston, Texas, serving as a comparison site, given that it was not directly impacted by the spill. One hundred participants were selected from each community, representing adults, seniors and children, with approximately equal numbers of males and females in each group. Participants completed initial assessments including completion of a 'baseline' survey and, rigorous physical assessments. Results from wave 1 data collection reported herein reveal changes in self-reported physical health and mental health status following the oil spill, disparities in access to healthcare, and associations between mental health and emotional conditions related to displacement/unemployment. Few environmental health studies have been conducted in communities impacted by significant oil spills. Results imply potential prolonged effects on mental health and community vulnerability.",

    "articleAbstract": "Advancements in medical science and technology, medicine and public health coupled with increased consciousness about nutrition and environmental and personal hygiene have paved the way for the dramatic increase in life expectancy globally in the past several decades. However, increased life expectancy has given rise to an increasing aging population, thus jeopardizing the socio-economic structure of many countries in terms of costs associated with elderly healthcare and wellbeing. In order to cope with the growing need for elderly healthcare services, it is essential to develop affordable, unobtrusive and easy-to-use healthcare solutions. Smart homes, which incorporate environmental and wearable medical sensors, actuators, and modern communication and information technologies, can enable continuous and remote monitoring of elderly health and wellbeing at a low cost. Smart homes may allow the elderly to stay in their comfortable home environments instead of expensive and limited healthcare facilities. Healthcare personnel can also keep track of the overall health condition of the elderly in real-time and provide feedback and support from distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research and development in smart home based remote healthcare technologies.",

    "articleAbstract": "Accruing evidence suggests that Xanthine Oxidase inhibitors (XOis) may bring direct renal benefits, besides those related to their hypo-uricemic effect. We hence aimed at performing a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to verify if treatment with XOis may improve renal outcomes in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed and CENTRAL databases were searched for RCTs comparing any XOi to standard therapy or placebo. The primary endpoint of interest was progression to End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD); secondary endpoints were changes in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria and albuminuria.XOis treatment significantly reduced the risk of ESKD compared to the control (3 studies, 204 pts; RR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22, 0.80) and also improved eGFR in data pooled from RCTs with long follow-up times (>3 mo.) (4 studies, 357 pts; mean difference (MD) 6.82 mL/min/1.73 m²; 95% CI, 3.50, 10.15) and high methodological quality (blind design) (3 studies, 400 pts; MD 2.61 mL/min/1.73 m²; 95% CI, 0.23, 4.99). Conversely, no definite effects were apparently noticed on serum creatinine, proteinuria and albuminuria.XOis may represent a promising tool for retarding disease progression in CKD patients. Future trials are awaited to confirm the generalizability of these findings to the whole CKD population.",

    "articleAbstract": "Indazole is considered a very important scaffold in medicinal chemistry. It is commonly found in compounds with diverse biological activities, e.g., antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. Considering that infectious diseases are associated to an inflammatory response, we designed a set of 2H-indazole derivatives by hybridization of cyclic systems commonly found in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory compounds. The derivatives were synthesized and tested against selected intestinal and vaginal pathogens, including the protozoa Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Trichomonas vaginalis; the bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; and the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Biological evaluations revealed that synthesized compounds have antiprotozoal activity and, in most cases, are more potent than the reference drug metronidazole, e.g., compound 18 is 12.8 times more active than metronidazole against G. intestinalis. Furthermore, two 2,3-diphenyl-2H-indazole derivatives (18 and 23) showed in vitro growth inhibition against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. In addition to their antimicrobial activity, the anti-inflammatory potential for selected compounds was evaluated in silico and in vitro against human cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The results showed that compounds 18, 21, 23, and 26 display in vitro inhibitory activity against COX-2, whereas docking calculations suggest a similar binding mode as compared to rofecoxib, the crystallographic reference.",

    "articleAbstract": "Meat consumers around the world are increasingly paying attention to product quality and safety, and are starting to reduce their meat consumption, especially with regard to red meat. This trend is prevalent in households with children who prefer health-certified meat products. Our study compares meat consumption habits in households with and without children or adolescences (0-18 years). A structured questionnaire was distributed to 401 retail purchasers at 12 different points of sales of meat in the Piedmont region in northwest Italy. Socio-demographic variables and quantitative-qualitative meat consumption habits of retail purchasers were investigated. One part of the questionnaire analyzed the relative importance of 12 meat choice purchasing attributes by employing the Best-Worst scaling methodology, a type of choice experiment. Our research found that households without children (subset B) have higher weekly meat consumption habits than those with children (subset A). Alternatively, the households with children (subset A) have a diet characterized by a greater variety of protein sources, such as legumes and fish. Both of the considered subsets preferred trusted butchers for meat buying, with supermarkets as a second choice. However, only consumers of subset A bought meat from farm butchers. Our team performed a consumer analysis to identify meat consumption patterns in the two considered subsets. Simultaneously, a Best-Worst analysis evidenced several choice attributes with different relevance for the two investigated samples segmentation in three clusters of purchase.",

    "articleAbstract": "Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) have several advantages for use as endodontic materials, and such advantages include ease of use, biocompatibility, potential hydroxyapatite-forming ability, and bond creation between the dentin and appropriate filling materials. However, unlike tricalcium silicate (CS)-based materials, CPCs do not have antibacterial properties. The present study doped a nonwashable CPC with 0.25-1.0 wt % hinokitiol and added 0, 5, and 10 wt % CS. The CPCs with 0.25-0.5 wt % hinokitiol showed appreciable antimicrobial properties without alterations in their working or setting times, mechanical properties, or cytocompatibility. Addition of CS slightly retarded the apatite formation of CPC and the working and setting time was obviously reduced. Moreover, addition of CS dramatically increased the compressive strength of CPC. Doping CS with 5 wt % ZnO provided additional antibacterial effects to the present CPC system. CS and hinokitiol exerted a synergic antibacterial effect, and the CPC with 0.25 wt % hinokitiol and 10 wt % CS (doped with 5 wt % ZnO) had higher antibacterial properties than that of pure CS. The addition of 10 wt % bismuth subgallate doubled the CPC radiopacity. The results demonstrate that hinokitiol and CS can improve the antibacterial properties of CPCs, and they can thus be considered for endodontic applications.",

In this study, samples of non-woven flax fibers, hemp fibers, and mats made of co-mingled randomly-oriented flax or hemp fiber (50%) and polypropylene fiber (50%) were subjected to 28 days of exposure to (i) no water-no fungi, (ii) water only and (iii) water along with the Chaetomium globosum fungus. Biocomposite samples were measured for weight loss over time, to observe the rate of fungal growth and the respiration of cellulose components in the fibers. Tensile testing was conducted to measure mechanical properties of the composite samples under different configurations. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to visualize fungal hyphal growth on the natural fibers, as well as to observe the fracture planes and failure modes of the biocomposite samples. Results showed that fungal growth significantly affects the dry mass as well as the tensile elastic modulus of the tested natural fiber mats and composites, and the effect depends on both the type and the length scale of fibers, as well as the exposure condition and time.",

    "articleAbstract": "The multi-sensor data fusion technique plays a significant role in fault diagnosis and in a variety of such applications, and the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is employed to improve the system performance; whereas, it may generate a counter-intuitive result when the pieces of evidence highly conflict with each other. To handle this problem, a novel multi-sensor data fusion approach on the basis of the distance of evidence, belief entropy and fuzzy preference relation analysis is proposed. A function of evidence distance is first leveraged to measure the conflict degree among the pieces of evidence; thus, the support degree can be obtained to represent the reliability of the evidence. Next, the uncertainty of each piece of evidence is measured by means of the belief entropy. Based on the quantitative uncertainty measured above, the fuzzy preference relations are applied to represent the relative credibility preference of the evidence. Afterwards, the support degree of each piece of evidence is adjusted by taking advantage of the relative credibility preference of the evidence that can be utilized to generate an appropriate weight with respect to each piece of evidence. Finally, the modified weights of the evidence are adopted to adjust the bodies of the evidence in the advance of utilizing Dempster's combination rule. A numerical example and a practical application in fault diagnosis are used as illustrations to demonstrate that the proposal is reasonable and efficient in the management of conflict and fault diagnosis.",

We suppose that prebiotic chemistry would generate a diverse mixture of potential monomers, and that random polymerization would generate non-uniform strands of mixed chirality, monomer composition, and bond type. We ask what factors lead to the emergence of RNA from this mixture. We show that template-directed replication can lead to the emergence of all the uniform properties of RNA by the same mechanism. We study a computational model in which nucleotides react via polymerization, hydrolysis, and template-directed ligation. Uniform strands act as templates for ligation of shorter oligomers of the same type, whereas mixed strands do not act as templates. The three uniform properties emerge naturally when the ligation rate is high. If there is an exact symmetry, as with the chase of chirality, the uniform property arises via a symmetry-breaking phase transition. If there is no exact symmetry, as with monomer selection and backbone regioselectivity, the uniform property emerges gradually as the rate of template-directed ligation is increased.",

    "articleAbstract": "Curli amyloid fibers are the major protein component of the extracellular matrix produced by Enterobacteriaceae during biofilm formation. Curli are required for proper biofilm development and environmental persistence by Escherichia coli. Here, we present a complete and vetted genetic analysis of functional amyloid fiber biogenesis. The Keio collection of single gene deletions was screened on Congo red indicator plates to identify E. coli mutants that had defective amyloid production. We discovered that more than three hundred gene products modulated curli production. These genes were involved in fundamental cellular processes such as regulation, environmental sensing, respiration, metabolism, cell envelope biogenesis, transport, and protein turnover. The alternative sigma factors, σ(S) and σ(E), had opposing roles in curli production. Mutations that induced the σ(E) or Cpx stress response systems had reduced curli production, while mutant strains with increased σ(S) levels had increased curli production. Mutations in metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis and the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), produced less curli. Regulation of the master biofilm regulator, CsgD, was diverse, and the screen revealed several proteins and small RNAs (sRNA) that regulate csgD messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Using previously published studies, we found minimal overlap between the genes affecting curli biogenesis and genes known to impact swimming or swarming motility, underlying the distinction between motile and sessile lifestyles. Collectively, the diversity and number of elements required suggest curli production is part of a highly regulated and complex developmental pathway in E. coli.",

The results showed that sintered samples by SPS have the highest relative density (99% of theoretical density), bending strength (291 ± 12 MPa), and hardness (253 ± 23 HV). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations showed the formation of TiO₂ from the surface layer decomposition of TiC particles.

    "articleAbstract": "As millions of immigrants moved to Hong Kong (HK) from China in the recent decades, large amount of residential housings were built in the early years and a substantial proportion of those buildings used asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). Since the number of new cases of ARDs diagnosed has increased year by year since 1990's, the remarkable increase of incidences had drawn the attention of the public and most importantly the HK government. It became one of the trigger points leading to asbestos ban in HK history. Comparatively, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions and patients' self-help organizations demonstrated a more aggressive and proactive attitude than the HK government and have played a key role in the development of asbestos banning policy in HK. After numerous petitions and meetings with the government representatives by those parties in the past decade, the HK government eventually changed its attitude and started to consider terminating the endless threat from asbestos by amending the policy, and the new clause of legislation for banning of all forms of asbestos was enacted on 4 April 2014. Other than the restriction of asbestos use, the compensation system about ARDs has also made some great moves by the effort of those parties as well. Based on the experience we learnt through the years, efforts from different stakeholders including patients' self-help organizations, NGOs, legislative councilors, and media power are absolutely essential to the success of progression and development in today's asbestos banning in HK.",

    "articleAbstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) ensures regulation of the protein pool in the cell by ubiquitination of proteins followed by their degradation by the proteasome. It plays a central role in the cell under normal physiological conditions as well as during viral infections. On the one hand, the UPS can be used by the cell to degrade viral proteins, thereby restricting the viral infection. On the other hand, it can also be subverted by the virus to its own advantage, notably to induce degradation of cellular restriction factors. This makes the UPS a central player in viral restriction and counter-restriction. In this respect, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and 2) represent excellent examples. Indeed, many steps of the HIV life cycle are restricted by cellular proteins, some of which are themselves components of the UPS. However, HIV itself hijacks the UPS to mediate defense against several cellular restriction factors. For example, the HIV auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpx and Vpu counteract specific restriction factors by the recruitment of cellular UPS components. In this review, we describe the interplay between HIV and the UPS to illustrate its role in the restriction of viral infections and its hijacking by viral proteins for counter-restriction.",

    "articleAbstract": "Alaska Native (AN) and American Indian (AI) people are underrepresented in health research, yet many decline to participate in studies due to past researcher misconduct. Southcentral Foundation (SCF), an Alaska Native-owned and operated health care organization, is transforming the relationship between researchers and the tribal community by making trust and accountability required features of health research in AN/AI communities. In 1998, SCF assumed ownership from the federal government of health services for AN/AI people in south central Alaska and transformed the health system into a relationship-based model of care. This change reimagines how researchers interact with tribal communities and established community oversight of all health research conducted with AN/AI people in the region. We describe the SCF research review process, which requires tribal approval of the research concept, full proposal, and dissemination products, as well as local institutional review board approval, and a researcher-signed contract. This review evaluates research through the lens of tribal principles, practices, and priorities. The SCF example provides a framework for other tribes and organizations seeking to reshape the future of health research in AN/AI communities.",

    "articleAbstract": "Non-invasive real time evaluation of living cell conditions and functions are increasingly desired in the field of clinical diagnosis. For diagnosis of type I allergy, the identification of antigens that induces activation of mast cells and basophils is crucial to avoid symptoms of allergic diseases. However, conventional tests, such as detection of antigen-specific IgE antibody and skin tests, are either of low reliability or are invasive. To overcome such problems, we hereby applied an impedance sensor for label-free and real-time monitoring of mast cell reactions in response to stimuli. When IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells cultured on the electrodes were stimulated with various concentrations of antigens, dose-dependent cell index (CI) increases were detected. Moreover, we confirmed that the impedance sensor detected morphological changes rather than degranulation as the indicator of cell activation. Furthermore, the CI of human IgE receptor-expressing cells (RBL-48 cells) treated with serum of a sweat allergy-positive patient, but not with serum from a sweat allergy-negative patient, significantly increased in response to purified human sweat antigen. We thus developed a technique to detect the activation of living cells in response to stimuli without any labeling using the impedance sensor. This system may represent a high reliable tool for the diagnosis of type I allergy.",

    "articleAbstract": "In recent years, considerable advances concerning therapeutic strategies in patients with metastatic cancer have been achieved. Particularly in renal cell cancer (RCC) and advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), immune-activating and antiangiogenic (AA) drugs (i.e., checkpoint antibodies and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptors (VEGFR) targeting compounds, respectively) have been successfully developed. As immune-effector cells have to enter the tumor, it is tempting to speculate that the combination of immunotherapy with AA treatment may induce synergistic effects. In this short review, we explore the theoretical background and the therapeutic potential of this novel treatment option for patients with advanced RCC or NSCLC. We discuss the growing body of evidence that pro-angiogenic factors negatively modulate the T-cell-mediated immune response and examine the preclinical evidence for testing combined immune-activating and AA therapy concepts in clinical practice. Particular attention will also be paid to potential novel treatment-related adverse events induced by combination treatment.",

Here we utilize the late-stage oxidation of tetrahydroazepines as an approach to access densely functionalized oxo-azepines in a total of 8 steps and ~30% overall yield from commercially available starting materials. Hydroboration of tetrahydroazepines proceeded with diastereoselectivity in a substrate-dependent manner to yield regioisomeric azepanols before their oxidation to the corresponding oxo-azepines. Regioselectivity of the hydroboration step may be improved moderately by a rhodium catalyst, albeit with loss of conversion to a competing hydrogenation pathway. Overall our method allows efficient access to azepanols and oxo-azepines as versatile epitopes and synthons with a high degree of diastereoselectivity and moderate regioselectivity.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nowadays, cement manufacture is one of the most polluting worldwide industrial sectors. In order to reduce its CO₂ emissions, the clinker replacement by ground granulated blast-furnace slag and fly ash is becoming increasingly common. Both additions are well-studied when the hardening conditions of cementitious materials are optimum. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to study the short-term effects of exposure, to both laboratory simulated and real in situ Mediterranean climate environments, on the microstructure and durability-related properties of mortars made using commercial slag and fly ash cements, as well as ordinary Portland cement. The real in situ condition consisted of placing the samples at approximately 100 m away from the Mediterranean Sea. The microstructure was analysed using mercury intrusion porosimetry. The effective porosity, the capillary suction coefficient and the non-steady state chloride migration coefficient were also studied. In view of the results obtained, the non-optimum laboratory simulated Mediterranean environment was a good approach to the real in situ one. Finally, mortars prepared using sustainable cements with slag and fly ash exposed to both Mediterranean climate environments, showed adequate service properties in the short-term (90 days), similar to or even better than those in mortars made with ordinary Portland cement.",

An iconic community-wide TNR effort; initiated in 1992 and renowned for having eliminated hundreds of free-roaming cats from the Newburyport; Massachusetts waterfront; is cited repeatedly; yet few details appear in the literature. Although the presence of feline population data was quite limited; a detailed narrative emerged from an examination of contemporaneous reports; extant TNR program documents; and stakeholder testimony. Available evidence indicates that an estimated 300 free-roaming cats were essentially unmanaged prior to the commencement of the TNR program; a quick reduction of up to one-third of the cats on the waterfront was attributed to the adoption of sociable cats and kittens; the elimination of the remaining population; over a 17-year period; was ascribed to attrition. These findings illuminate the potential effectiveness of TNR as a management practice; as well as call attention to the need for broad adoption of systematic data collection and assessment protocols.",

    "articleAbstract": "Forsythia suspensa is an important medicinal plant and traditionally applied for the treatment of inflammation, pyrexia, gonorrhea, diabetes, and so on. However, there is limited sequence and genomic information available for F. suspensa. Here, we produced the complete chloroplast genomes of F. suspensa using Illumina sequencing technology. F. suspensa is the first sequenced member within the genus Forsythia (Oleaceae). The gene order and organization of the chloroplast genome of F. suspensa are similar to other Oleaceae chloroplast genomes. The F. suspensa chloroplast genome is 156,404 bp in length, exhibits a conserved quadripartite structure with a large single-copy (LSC; 87,159 bp) region, and a small single-copy (SSC; 17,811 bp) region interspersed between inverted repeat (IRa/b; 25,717 bp) regions. A total of 114 unique genes were annotated, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA, and four rRNA. The low GC content (37.8%) and codon usage bias for A- or T-ending codons may largely affect gene codon usage. Sequence analysis identified a total of 26 forward repeats, 23 palindrome repeats with lengths >30 bp (identity > 90%), and 54 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with an average rate of 0.35 SSRs/kb. We predicted 52 RNA editing sites in the chloroplast of F. suspensa, all for C-to-U transitions. IR expansion or contraction and the divergent regions were analyzed among several species including the reported F. suspensa in this study. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole-plastome revealed that F. suspensa, as a member of the Oleaceae family, diverged relatively early from Lamiales. This study will contribute to strengthening medicinal resource conservation, molecular phylogenetic, and genetic engineering research investigations of this species.",

    "articleAbstract": "Studies on long-term exposure to foods/nutrients and its associations with fracture risk are scarce. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we determined the prospective association of dietary and nutrient patterns with fractures. Data from 15,572 adults aged ≥18 years were analyzed. Fracture occurrence was self-reported and dietary intake data were collected using a 24-h recall method for three consecutive days, for each individual across nine waves (1989-2011). We used cumulative and overall mean, recent and baseline dietary and nutrient exposures. Hazard ratios (HR) were used to determine the associations. Two dietary (traditional and modern) and two nutrient (plant- and animal-sourced) patterns were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, study participants in the third tertiles (highest intake) of the modern dietary and animal-sourced nutrient patterns' cumulative scores had a 34% (HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.06-1.71) and 37% (HR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.08-1.72) increase in fracture risks compared to those in the first tertiles, respectively. While the overall mean factor scores of dietary and nutrient patterns had a similar (or stronger) pattern of association as the cumulative scores, no association between recent and baseline scores and fracture was found. Greater adherence to a modern dietary and/or an animal-sourced nutrient pattern is associated with a higher risk of total fractures. This suggests that a modern animal based diet is related to bone fragility. A repeated three-day 24-h recall dietary assessment provides a stronger association with fracture compared to a recent or baseline exposure.",

    "articleAbstract": "Probiotic supplementation reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm infants, but it remains to be determined whether this reduction translates into a reduction of other complications. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the possible role of probiotics in altering the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Fifteen randomized controlled trials (4782 infants; probiotics: 2406) were included. None of the included studies assessed BPD as the primary outcome. Meta-analysis confirmed a significant reduction of NEC (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.81, p = 0.004; random effects model), and an almost significant reduction of LOS (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, p = 0.084). In contrast, meta-analysis could not demonstrate a significant effect of probiotics on BPD, defined either as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11, p = 0.900, 6 studies) or at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.20, p = 0.203, 12 studies). Meta-regression did not show any significant association between the RR for NEC or LOS and the RR for BPD. In conclusion, our results suggest that NEC and LOS prevention by probiotics does not affect the risk of developing BPD in preterm infants.",

    "articleAbstract": "Paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug for solid tumors, induces peripheral painful neuropathy. Bee venom acupuncture (BVA) has been reported to have potent analgesic effects, which are known to be mediated by activation of spinal α-adrenergic receptor. Here, we investigated the effect of BVA on mechanical hyperalgesia and spinal neuronal hyperexcitation induced by paclitaxel. The role of spinal α-adrenergic receptor subtypes in the analgesic effect of BVA was also observed. Administration of paclitaxel (total 8 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) on four alternate days (days 0, 2, 4, and 6) induced significant mechanical hyperalgesic signs, measured using a von Frey filament. BVA (1 mg/kg, ST36) relieved this mechanical hyperalgesia for at least two hours, and suppressed the hyperexcitation in spinal wide dynamic range neurons evoked by press or pinch stimulation. Both melittin (0.5 mg/kg, ST36) and phospholipase A2 (0.12 mg/kg, ST36) were shown to play an important part in this analgesic effect of the BVA, as they significantly attenuated the pain. Intrathecal pretreatment with the α₂-adrenergic receptor antagonist (idazoxan, 50 µg), but not α₁-adrenergic receptor antagonist (prazosin, 30 µg), blocked the analgesic effect of BVA. These results suggest that BVA has potent suppressive effects against paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, which were mediated by spinal α₂-adrenergic receptor.",

    "articleAbstract": "The biopsychosocial model is a modern humanistic and holistic view of the human being in health sciences. Currently, many researchers think the biopsychosocial model should be expanded to include the spiritual dimension as well. However, \"spiritual\" is an open and fluid concept, and it can refer to many different things. This paper intends to explore the spiritual dimension in all its meanings: the spirituality-and-health relationship; spiritual-religious coping; the spirituality of the physician affecting his/her practice; spiritual support for inpatients; spiritual complementary therapies; and spiritual anomalous phenomena. In order to ascertain whether physicians would be willing to embrace them all in practice, each phrase from the Physician's Pledge on the Declaration of Geneva (World Medical Association) was \"translated\" in this paper to its spiritual equivalent. Medical practice involves a continuous process of revisions of applied concepts, but a true paradigm shift will occur only when the human spiritual dimension is fully understood and incorporated into health care. Then, one will be able to cut stereotypes and use the term \"biopsychosocial-spiritual model\" correctly. A sincere and profound application of this new view of the human being would bring remarkable transformations to the concepts of health, disease, treatments, and cure.",

This study aimed to describe the baseline characteristics of children attending pediatric multidisciplinary weight management services and understand how this information will inform future service delivery. A total of 51 children and adolescents who were overweight and obese (27 male) and aged between two and 16 years participated. Body size measures such as body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage were collected. Participants and their parents/guardians also completed questionnaires on dietary intake, behaviors and habits, physical activity and health-related quality of life. A total of 72% of participants were classified as morbidly obese. Adolescents had significantly lower scores for overall diet, physical activity and particular health-related quality of life scores. No significant correlations were found between BMI z-scores and diet, physical activity and health-related quality of life. In adolescents, correlations were detected between dietary scores and health-related quality of life. Results confirm the need to critically examine the current context to adapt and tailor interventions to individual circumstances, and when combined with focused referral, triaging and screening processes, should assist in delivering the right care at the right time.",

In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, volunteers were assigned to the ACS or placebo group (1:1). Sixty healthy elderly volunteers (active, n = 30; placebo, n = 30) completed the study. The ACS group was administered 1.0 g of anserine/carnosine (3:1) for 3 months. A microarray analysis and subsequent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed decreased expression of CCL24, an inflammatory chemokine (p < 0.05). Verbal memory, assessed using the Wechsler memory scale-logical memory, was preserved in the ACS group. An age-restricted sub-analysis showed significant verbal memory preservation by ACS in participants who were in their 60s (active, n = 12; placebo, n = 9; p = 0.048) and 70s (active, n = 7; placebo, n = 11; p = 0.017). The suppression of CCL24 expression was greatest in people who were in their 70s (p < 0.01). There was a significant correlation between the preservation of verbal memory and suppression of CCL24 expression in the group that was in the 70s (Poisson correlation, r = 0.46, p < 0.05). These results suggest that ACS may preserve verbal episodic memory, probably owing to CCL24 suppression in the blood, especially in elderly participants.",

    "articleAbstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of permanent birth defects, highlighting the need to develop an HCMV vaccine candidate. However, HCMV vaccine development is complicated by the varying capacity of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to interfere in vitro with the HCMV entry routes mediating infection of fibroblast (FB) and epithelial cells (EC). While HCMV infection of FB and EC requires glycoprotein complexes composed of gB and gH/gL/gO, EC infection depends additionally on the envelope pentamer complex (PC) composed of gH, gL, UL128, UL130 and UL131A. Unlike NAb to gB or gH epitopes that can interfere with both FB and EC infection, NAb targeting predominantly conformational epitopes of the UL128/130/131A subunits are unable to prevent FB entry, though they are highly potent in blocking EC infection. Despite the selective requirement of the PC for EC entry, the PC is exceptionally immunogenic as vaccine antigen to stimulate both EC- and FB-specific NAb responses due to its capacity to elicit NAb that target epitopes of the UL128/130/131A subunits and gH. These findings suggest that the PC could be sufficient in a subunit vaccine formulation to induce robust FB- and EC-specific NAb responses. In this short review, we discuss NAb responses induced through natural infection and vaccination that interfere in vitro with HCMV infection of FB and EC.",

Recently, UPS inhibition has been shown to be a key factor in fatty liver graft preservation during organ cold storage using University of Wisconsin solution (UW) and Institute Georges Lopez (IGL-1) solutions. However, the merits of IGL-1 and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solutions for fatty liver preservation have not been compared. Fatty liver grafts from obese Zücker rats were preserved for 24 h at 4 °C. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), ATP, adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK), e-NOS, proteasome activity and liver polyubiquitinated proteins were determined. IGL-1 solution prevented ATP breakdown during cold-storage preservation of steatotic livers to a greater extent than HTK solution. There were concomitant increases in AMPK activation, e-NOS (endothelial NOS (NO synthase)) expression and UPS inhibition. UPS activity is closely related to the composition of the solution used to preserve the organ. IGL-1 solution provided significantly better protection against ischemia-reperfusion for cold-stored fatty liver grafts than HTK solution. The effect is exerted through the activation of the protective AMPK signaling pathway, an increase in e-NOS expression and a dysregulation of the UPS.",

    "articleAbstract": "The pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is complex and multifactorial. It is hypothesized that the critical events initiating this condition occur outside the brain, particularly in the peripheral blood. Diagnoses of HIV-induced neurocognitive disorders largely rely on neuropsychometric assessments, which are not precise. Total HIV DNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), quantified by PCR, correlate with disease progression, which is a promising biomarker to predict HAND. Numerous PCR assays for HIV DNA in cell compartments are prone to variation due to the lack of standardization and, therefore, their utility in predicting HAND produced different outcomes. This review evaluates the clinical relevance of total HIV DNA in circulating mononuclear cells using different published quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocols. The rationale is to shed light on the most appropriate assays and sample types used to accurately quantify HIV DNA load, which predicts severity of neurocognitive impairment. The role of monocytes as a vehicle for trafficking HIV into the CNS makes it the most suitable sample for determining a HAND associated reservoir. Studies have also shown significant associations between monocyte HIV DNA levels with markers of neurodamage. However, qPCR assays using PBMCs are cheaper and available commercially, thus could be beneficial in clinical settings. There is need, however, to standardise DNA extraction, normalisation and limit of detection.",

    "articleAbstract": "Measles virus (MV) infection is re-emerging, despite the availability of an effective vaccine. The mechanism of MV entry into a target cell relies on coordinated action between the MV hemagglutinin (H) receptor binding protein and the fusion envelope glycoprotein (F) which mediates fusion between the viral and cell membranes. Peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) of F can interfere with this process, blocking MV infection. As previously described, biophysical properties of HRC-derived peptides modulate their antiviral potency. In this work, we characterized a MV peptide fusion inhibitor conjugated to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a cholesterol derivative with intrinsic antiviral activity, and evaluated its interaction with membrane model systems and human blood cells. The peptide (MV.",

    "articleAbstract": "Physical inactivity is a major modifiable risk factor for morbidity, disability and premature mortality worldwide. This study assessed the geographical variations in the impact of environmental quality on physical inactivity among U.S. adults. Data on county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity came from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. County environment was measured by the Environmental Quality Index (EQI), a comprehensive index of environmental conditions that affect human health. The overall EQI consists of five subdomains-air, water, land, social, and built environment. Geographically weighted regressions (GWRs) were performed to estimate and map county-specific impact of overall EQI and its five subdomains on physical inactivity prevalence. The prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity among U.S. counties was 25% in 2005. On average, one standard deviation decrease in the overall EQI was associated with an increase in county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity by nearly 1%. However, substantial geographical variations in the estimated environmental determinants of physical inactivity were present. The estimated changes of county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity resulted from one standard deviation decrease of the overall EQI ranged from an increase of over 3% to a decrease of nearly 2% across U.S. counties. Analogous, the estimated changes of county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity resulted from one standard deviation decrease of the EQI air, water, land, social, and built environment subdomains ranged from an increase of 2.6%, 1.5%, 2.9%, 3.3%, and 1.7% to a decrease of 2.9%, 1.4%, 2.4%, 2.4%, and 0.8% across U.S. counties, respectively. Given the substantial heterogeneities in the environmental determinants of physical inactivity, locally customized physical activity interventions are warranted to address the most concerning area-specific environmental issue.",

    "articleAbstract": "White spot lesions (WSLs) are irreversible damages in orthodontic treatment due to excessive etching or demineralization by microorganisms. In this study, we conducted a mechanical and cell viability test to examine the antibacterial properties of 0.2% and 1% bioactive glass (BAG) and silver-doped and zinc-doped BAGs in a primer and evaluated their clinical applicability to prevent WSLs. The microhardness statistically significantly increased in the adhesive-containing BAG, while the other samples showed no statistically significant difference compared with the control group. The shear bond strength of all samples increased compared with that of the control group. The cell viability of the control and sample groups was similar within 24 h, but decreased slightly over 48 h. All samples showed antibacterial properties. Regarding remineralization property, the group containing 0.2% of the samples showed remineralization properties compared with the control group, but was not statistically significant; further, the group containing 1% of the samples showed a significant difference compared with the control group. Among them, the orthodontic bonding primer containing 1% silver-doped BAG showed the highest remineralization property. The new orthodontic bonding primer used in this study showed an antimicrobial effect, chemical remineralization effect, and WSL prevention as well as clinically applicable properties, both physically and biologically.",

The sensor is a single-chip platform, including several sensing structures and a low-offset, low-noise readout interface. A recently proposed offset compensation approach is implemented obtaining low temperature drift and excellent long time stability. The sensor is fabricated by applying a simple micromachining procedure to a chip produced using the BCD6s process of STMicroelectronics. Application of a gas conveyor allowed inclusion of the sensing structure into a channel of sub-millimeter cross-section. The results of measurements performed by making controlled air volumes pass through the sensor channel in both directions at rates from 0.1 to 5 mL/min are described.",

The inhibition of PI3K kinase can effectively block the conduction of signaling pathways and is an ideal target for drug design. In this paper; two series of 4-morpholino-7,8-dihydro-5H-thiopyrano[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives bearing pyrazoline moiety (7a-l; 8a-l) were synthesized; and their cytotoxicity in vitro were evaluated by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method against four human cancer cell lines including A549; PC-3; MCF-7; and HepG2 cell lines. The activity of the most promising compound 8d against PI3Kα kinase was further evaluated. The results indicated that most of the target compounds showed moderate to excellent cytotoxicity and the most promising compound 8d showed excellent cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 6.02-10.27 μM. In addition; the compound 8d was found to have a moderate inhibitory activity in the PI3Kα enzyme assay. What's more; the compounds of which the substituents of benzene ring at the C-4 position are electron-withdrawing groups such as substituents (Cl; F; Br) have better activity than the compounds containing the electron donating groups (OCH₃; H). However; the exact action mechanism is not quite clear right now. Further study will be carried out to identify the exact target in near future.",

    "articleAbstract": "Despite the negative health effects of too much sitting, the majority of adults are too sedentary. To develop effective interventions, insight is needed into home environmental correlates of adults' sedentary behaviors, and into the susceptibility of population subgroups to these home environmental cues. In total, 559 Flemish adults reported socio-demographics, weight and height, home environmental factors and domain-specific sedentary behaviors. Generalized linear modeling was conducted to examine main associations between home environmental factors and domain-specific sedentary behaviors, and to test the moderating role of socio-demographics and BMI on these associations. In case of significant interactions, stratified analyses were performed. Results showed that, among those who did use a computer/laptop during the last week, a one-unit increase in the number of computers or laptops was associated with 17% (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.34) and 24% (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.08, 1.43) more minutes computer time per day, respectively. The proximity of the remote controller (p < 0.001) and the number of televisions (p = 0.03) were positively associated with television time, and the number of motorized vehicles (95% CI = 0.001, 0.12) was positively associated with the odds of participation in transport-related sitting time. The latter two associations were moderated by BMI, with significant positive associations limited to those not overweight. To conclude, home environmental factors were associated with domain-specific sedentary behaviors, especially in healthy weight adults. If confirmed by longitudinal studies, public health professionals should encourage adults to limit the number of indoor entertainment devices and motorized vehicles.",

    "articleAbstract": "We aimed to prospectively assess changes in chronic stress among young adults transitioning from high school to university or working life. A population-based cohort in Munich and Dresden (Germany) was followed from age 16-18 (2002-2003) to age 20-23 (2007-2009) (n = 1688). Using the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress, two dimensions of stress at university or work were assessed: work overload and work discontent. In the multiple ordinal generalized estimating equations, socio-demographics, stress outside the workplace, and job history were additionally considered. At follow-up, 52% of the population were university students. Work overload increased statistically significantly from first to second follow-up, while work discontent remained constant at the population level. Students, compared to employees, reported a larger increase in work overload (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.33; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.07, 1.67), while work discontent did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, work overload increases when young adults transition from school to university/job life, with university students experiencing the largest increase.",

    "articleAbstract": "The use of electric bikes (e-bikes) has grown in popularity, especially in large cities where overcrowding and traffic congestion are common. This paper proposes an intelligent engine management system for e-bikes which uses the information collected from sensors to optimize battery energy and time. The intelligent engine management system consists of a built-in network of sensors in the e-bike, which is used for multi-sensor data fusion; the collected data is analysed and fused and on the basis of this information the system can provide the user with optimal and personalized assistance. The user is given recommendations related to battery consumption, sensors, and other parameters associated with the route travelled, such as duration, speed, or variation in altitude. To provide a user with these recommendations, artificial neural networks are used to estimate speed and consumption for each of the segments of a route. These estimates are incorporated into evolutionary algorithms in order to make the optimizations. A comparative analysis of the results obtained has been conducted for when routes were travelled with and without the optimization system. From the experiments, it is evident that the use of an engine management system results in significant energy and time savings. Moreover, user satisfaction increases as the level of assistance adapts to user behavior and the characteristics of the route.",

    "articleAbstract": "Horticultural oils are an important component of integrated management programs of several phytophagous arthropods and pathogens affecting fruit, ornamentals and vegetables in greenhouse and field production systems. Although effective against the target pest, their incompatibility with biological control agents can compromise efforts to develop eco-friendly management programs for important agricultural pests. In this study, we assessed the in vitro effect of selected refined petroleum oils used in citrus and other horticultural crops with a biopesticide containing the entomopathogenic fungi, Isaria fumosorosea (PFR-97) under laboratory conditions. Further, we used leaf disk bioassays to evaluate the combined efficacy of petroleum oils and I. fumosorosea against the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae), a major pest of citrus in the United States. All five petroleum oil treatments (Orchex, Sun Pure, Conoco Blend -1, Conoco Blend -2, and JMS) were compatible with I. fumosorosea blastospores, as none of them were found to affect I. fumosorosea colony-forming units and radial fungal growth measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 days post-inoculation. All mixed treatments performed better than I. fumosorosea alone against D. citri, where the highest mean survival time of D. citri was 12.5 ± 0.7 days. No significant differences in D. citri survival time and I. fumosorosea growth (fungal development index) on dead cadavers, which is important for determining their horizontal transmission, were observed when mixed with Orchex, Sun Pure, Conoco Blend -2, and JMS. Results indicated that horticultural oils in combination with I. fumosorosea could offer citrus growers an alternative treatment for integrating into their current management programs while battling against D. citri in citrus production systems. Due to their eco-friendly, broad-spectrum effect, it could provide control against various citrus pests, while also encouraging the retention of effective chemistries for a longer period in the marketplace. However promising, these combination treatments need to be tested further with I. fumosorosea under grove conditions to confirm their field efficacy.",

    "articleAbstract": "The occurrence of congestion has an extremely deleterious impact on the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This article presents a novel protocol, named COALA (COngestion ALleviation and Avoidance), which aims to act both proactively, in order to avoid the creation of congestion in WSNs, and reactively, so as to mitigate the diffusion of upcoming congestion through alternative path routing. Its operation is based on the utilization of an accumulative cost function, which considers both static and dynamic metrics in order to send data through the paths that are less probable to be congested. COALA is validated through simulation tests, which exhibit its ability to achieve remarkable reduction of loss ratios, transmission delays and energy dissipation. Moreover, the appropriate adjustment of the weighting of the accumulative cost function enables the algorithm to adapt to the performance criteria of individual case scenarios.",

    "articleAbstract": "Conventional gyroscopes are equipped with a single-axis control input, limiting their performance. Although researchers have proposed control algorithms with dual-axis control inputs to improve gyroscope performance, most have verified the control algorithms through numerical simulations because they lacked practical devices with dual-axis control inputs. The aim of this study was to design a piezoelectric gyroscope equipped with a dual-axis control input so that researchers may experimentally verify those control algorithms in future. Designing a piezoelectric gyroscope with a dual-axis control input is more difficult than designing a conventional gyroscope because the control input must be effective over a broad frequency range to compensate for imperfections, and the multiple mode shapes in flexural deformations complicate the relation between flexural deformation and the proof mass position. This study solved these problems by using a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) material, introducing additional electrodes for shielding, developing an optimal electrode pattern, and performing calibrations of undesired couplings. The results indicated that the fabricated device could be operated at 5.5±1 kHz to perform dual-axis actuations and position measurements. The calibration of the fabricated device was completed by system identifications of a new dynamic model including gyroscopic motions, electromechanical coupling, mechanical coupling, electrostatic coupling, and capacitive output impedance. Finally, without the assistance of control algorithms, the \"open loop sensitivity\" of the fabricated gyroscope was 1.82 μV/deg/s with a nonlinearity of 9.5% full-scale output. This sensitivity is comparable with those of other PZT gyroscopes with single-axis control inputs.",

    "articleAbstract": "Ti-Ni-Si-O nanostructures were successfully prepared on Ti-1Ni-5Si alloy foils via electrochemical anodization in ethylene glycol/glycerol solutions containing a small amount of water. The Ti-Ni-Si-O nanostructures were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and diffuse reflectance absorption spectra. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical water splitting properties of the Ti-Ni-Si-O nanostructure films were investigated. It was found that, after anodization, three different kinds of Ti-Ni-Si-O nanostructures formed in the α-Ti phase region, Ti₂Ni phase region, and Ti₅Si₃ phase region of the alloy surface. Both the anatase and rutile phases of Ti-Ni-Si-O oxide appeared after annealing at 500 °C for 2 h. The photocurrent density obtained from the Ti-Ni-Si-O nanostructure photoanodes was 0.45 mA/cm² at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH solution. The above findings make it feasible to further explore excellent photoelectrochemical properties of the nanostructure-modified surface of Ti-Ni-Si ternary alloys.",

The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the essential oil was realized by gas chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques (GC-MS and GC-FID). Acorenone B was identified by GC-MS and NMR experiments. The enantiomeric distribution of some constituents has been assessed by enantio-GC through the use of a chiral cyclodextrin-based capillary column. We identified 41 components that accounted for 96.46% of the total analyzed, the major components were acorenone B (41.01%) and (E)-β-ocimene (29.64%). The enantiomeric ratio of (+)/(-)-β-pinene was 86.9:13.1, while the one of (+)/(-)-sabinene was 80.9:19.1. The essential oil showed a weak inhibitory activity, expressed as Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 10 mg/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 5 mg/mL). Furthermore, it inhibited butyrylcholinesterase with an IC50 value of 11.5 μg/mL. Pure acorenone B showed inhibitory activity against both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, with IC50 values of 40.8 μg/mL and 10.9 μg/mL, respectively.",

The main constituent of the cuticle is the lipid polyester cutin, which is composed of aliphatic and aromatic domains. The aliphatic component is a polyester between fatty acid/alcohol and hydroxycinnamoyl acid. The BAHD/HxxxD family enzymes are central to the synthesis of these polyesters. The nature of this class of enzymes in bryophytes has not been explored to date. Here, a gene encoding a fatty ω-hydroxyacid/fatty alcohol hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HFT) has been isolated from the liverwort Marchantia emarginata and has been functionally characterized. Experiments based on recombinant protein showed that the enzyme uses ω-hydroxy fatty acids or primary alcohols as its acyl acceptor and various hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs-preferentially feruloyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA-as acyl donors at least in vitro. The transient expression of a MeHFT-GFP fusion transgene in the Nicotiana benthamiana leaf demonstrated that MeHFT is directed to the cytoplasm, suggesting that the feruloylation of cutin monomers takes place there.",

    "articleAbstract": "Several families of multicopy genes, such as transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), are subject to concerted evolution, an effect that keeps sequences of paralogous genes effectively identical. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to distinguish orthologs from paralogs on the basis of sequence similarity alone. Synteny, the preservation of relative genomic locations, however, also remains informative for the disambiguation of evolutionary relationships in this situation. In this contribution, we describe an automatic pipeline for the evolutionary analysis of such cases that use genome-wide alignments as a starting point to assign orthology relationships determined by synteny. The evolution of tRNAs in primates as well as the history of the Y RNA family in vertebrates and nematodes are used to showcase the method. The pipeline is freely available.",

Based on examination of four isolates, this new species is described using a polyphasic approach. A concatenated alignment comprised of nine genes (ITS, benA, cmdA, mcm7, amdS, rpb1, preB, ppgA, and preA) was subjected to phylogenetic analysis, and resulted in all four strains being inferred as a distinct clade. Characterization of mating type for each strain revealed A. korhogoensis as a heterothallic species, since three isolates exhibited a singular MAT1-1 locus and one isolate exhibited a singular MAT1-2 locus. Morphological and physiological characterizations were also performed based on their growth on various types of media. Their respective extrolite profiles were characterized using LC/HRMS, and showed that this new species is capable of producing B- and G-aflatoxins, aspergillic acid, cyclopiazonic acid, aflavarins, and asparasones, as well as other metabolites. Altogether, our results confirm the monophyly of A. korhogoensis, and strengthen its position in the A. flavus clade, as the sister taxon of A. parvisclerotigenus.",

As these cable structures are exposed to continuous external loads, such as vehicle and wind loads, vibration control and continuous monitoring of the cable are required. In this study, an electromagnetic (EM) damper was designed and fabricated for vibration control and monitoring of the cable structure. EM dampers, also called regenerative dampers, consist of permanent magnets and coils. The electromagnetic force due to the relative motion between the coil and the permanent magnet can be used to control the vibration of the structure. The electrical energy can be used as a power source for the monitoring system. The effects of the design parameters of the damper were numerically analyzed and the damper was fabricated. The characteristics of the damper were analyzed with various external load changes. Finally, the vibration-control and energy-harvesting performances of the cable structure were evaluated through a hybrid simulation. The vibration-control and energy-harvesting performances for various loads were analyzed and the applicability to the cable structure of the EM damper was evaluated.",

    "articleAbstract": "In this study, a portable electronic nose (E-nose) was self-developed to identify rice wines with different marked ages-all the operations of the E-nose were controlled by a special Smartphone Application. The sensor array of the E-nose was comprised of 12 MOS sensors and the obtained response values were transmitted to the Smartphone thorough a wireless communication module. Then, Aliyun worked as a cloud storage platform for the storage of responses and identification models. The measurement of the E-nose was composed of the taste information obtained phase (TIOP) and the aftertaste information obtained phase (AIOP). The area feature data obtained from the TIOP and the feature data obtained from the TIOP-AIOP were applied to identify rice wines by using pattern recognition methods. Principal component analysis (PCA), locally linear embedding (LLE) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied for the classification of those wine samples. LDA based on the area feature data obtained from the TIOP-AIOP proved a powerful tool and showed the best classification results. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine (SVM) were applied for the predictions of marked ages and SVM (R² = 0.9942) worked much better than PLSR.",

    "articleAbstract": "Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the most common form of diabetes and one of the most common chronic diseases. Control of hyperglycaemia by hypoglycaemic drugs is insufficient in for patients and nutritional approaches are currently being explored. Natural dietary compounds such as flavonoids, abundant in fruits and vegetables, have received broad attention because of their potential capacity to act as anti-diabetic agents. Especially cocoa flavonoids have been proved to ameliorate important hallmarks of T2D. In this review, an update of the most relevant reports published during the last decade in cell culture, animal models and human studies is presented. Most results support an anti-diabetic effect of cocoa flavonoids by enhancing insulin secretion, improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, exerting a lipid-lowering effect and preventing the oxidative and inflammatory damages associated to the disease. While it could be suggested that daily consumption of flavanols from cocoa or dark chocolate would constitute a potential preventive tool useful for the nutritional management of T2D, this recommendation should be cautious since most of commercially available soluble cocoa products or chocolates contain low amount of flavanols and are rich in sugar and calories that may aggravate glycaemic control in T2D patients.",

This study explores patient knowledge and awareness of appropriate use of antibiotics and expectations regarding how antibiotics are used for their treatment in outpatient settings. A survey was administered to a convenience sample of patients, parents, and caregivers (n = 190) at seven primary care clinics and two urgent care locations. Fisher's exact tests compared results by patient characteristics. Although 89% of patients correctly believed that antibiotics work well for treating infections from bacteria, 53% incorrectly believed that antibiotics work well for treating viral infections. Patients who incorrectly believed that antibiotics work well for treating viral infections were more than twice as likely to expect a provider to give them an antibiotic when they have a cough or common cold. Patients who completed the survey also participated in semi-structured interviews (n = 4), which were analyzed using thematic analysis. Patients reported experiencing confusion about which illnesses may be treated by antibiotics and unclear communication from clinicians about the appropriate use of antibiotics. Development of easy to understand patient educational materials can help address patients' incorrect perceptions of appropriate antibiotic use and facilitate patient-provider communication.",

    "articleAbstract": "Fosfomycin is a bactericidal, low-molecular weight, broad-spectrum antibiotic, with putative activity against several bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, by irreversibly inhibiting an early stage in cell wall synthesis. Evidence suggests that fosfomycin has a synergistic effect when used in combination with other antimicrobial agents that act via a different mechanism of action, thereby allowing for reduced dosages and lower toxicity. Fosfomycin does not bind to plasma proteins and is cleared via the kidneys. Due to its extensive tissue penetration, fosfomycin may be indicated for infections of the CNS, soft tissues, bone, lungs, and abscesses. The oral bioavailability of fosfomycin tromethamine is <50%; therefore, oral administration of fosfomycin tromethamine is approved only as a 3-gram one-time dose for treating urinary tract infections. However, based on published PK parameters, PK/PD simulations have been performed for several multiple-dose regimens, which might lead to the future use of fosfomycin for treating complicated infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Because essential pharmacological information and knowledge regarding mechanisms of resistance are currently limited and/or controversial, further studies are urgently needed, and fosfomycin monotherapy should be avoided.",

    "articleAbstract": "Multi-camera systems are widely applied in the three dimensional (3D) computer vision, especially when multiple cameras are distributed on both sides of the measured object. The calibration methods of multi-camera systems are critical to the accuracy of vision measurement and the key is to find an appropriate calibration target. In this paper, a high-precision camera calibration method for multi-camera systems based on transparent glass checkerboards and ray tracing is described, and is used to calibrate multiple cameras distributed on both sides of the glass checkerboard. Firstly, the intrinsic parameters of each camera are obtained by Zhang's calibration method. Then, multiple cameras capture several images from the front and back of the glass checkerboard with different orientations, and all images contain distinct grid corners. As the cameras on one side are not affected by the refraction of glass checkerboard, extrinsic parameters can be directly calculated. However, the cameras on the other side are influenced by the refraction of glass checkerboard, and the direct use of projection model will produce a calibration error. A multi-camera calibration method using refractive projection model and ray tracing is developed to eliminate this error. Furthermore, both synthetic and real data are employed to validate the proposed approach. The experimental results of refractive calibration show that the error of the 3D reconstruction is smaller than 0.2 mm, the relative errors of both rotation and translation are less than 0.014%, and the mean and standard deviation of reprojection error of the four-camera system are 0.00007 and 0.4543 pixels, respectively. The proposed method is flexible, highly accurate, and simple to carry out.",

Such disorders underlie syndromes of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and edematous diseases, such as congestive heart failure and decompensated liver cirrhosis. All the causes are fundamentally from non-endocrine diseases. AVP-induced water retention could produce hyponatremia, and further accelerate poor long-term outcome of edematous diseases. Administration of AVP V₂ receptor antagonists verifies how much AVP is involved in the pathogenesis of the impaired water excretion. The present paper demonstrated that exaggerated release of AVP plays a crucial role as an accessory endocrine disorder in pathological states of water retention and dilutional hyponatremia in non-endocrine disorders.",

    "articleAbstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a type of inflammatory skin disease caused by genetics, immune system dysfunction, and environmental stresses. It is, however, still considered to be a refractory disease. Macrophages are inflammatory immune cells that infiltrate the skin and induce inflammation. We investigated the effect of refined deep-sea water (RDSW) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The results showed that RDSW suppressed the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Furthermore, nitric oxide, a product of iNOS, and prostaglandin (PG) D₂ and PGE₂, products of COX-2, were significantly inhibited by RDSW in a hardness-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that RDSW reversed the release of histamines and regressed the mRNA expressions and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor, in a hardness-dependent manner. We also found that the suppressive effect of RDSW on LPS-induced inflammatory responses was regulated by the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation, and ERK 1/2 and JNK 1/2 mediated the suppression of c-Jun and c-Fos expressions. In conclusion, the present investigation suggests the possibility that RDSW may be used to treat and/or prevent inflammatory diseases, including AD.",

    "articleAbstract": "Cardiac remodeling plays a crucial role in the development of heart failure after mycocardial infarction. Besides cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells are recognized to contribute to cardiac remodeling. We now investigated processes of endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in microvascular endothelial cells of rat (MVEC) under hypoxia and paracrine effects on ventricular cardiomyocytes of adult rat. Exposure of MVECs to hypoxia/reoxygenation enhanced TGFβ/SMAD signaling, since phosphorylation, and thus activation, of SMAD1/5 and SMAD2 increased. This increase was blocked by inhibitors of TGFβ receptor types ALK1 or ALK5. Exposure of ventricular cardiomyocytes to conditioned medium from hypoxic/reoxygenated MVECs enhanced SMAD2 phosphorylation and provoked apoptosis in cardiomyoyctes. Both were blocked by ALK5 inhibition. To analyze autocrine effects of hypoxic TGFβ signaling we investigated EndoMT in MVECs. After 3 days of hypoxia the mesenchymal marker protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and the number of α-SMA- and fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP1)-positive cells increased in MVECs cultures. This was blocked by ALK5 inhibition. Similarly, TGFβ₁ provoked enhanced expression of α-SMA and FSP1 in MVECs. In conclusion, hypoxia provokes EndoMT in MVECs via TGFβ₁/SMAD2 signaling. Furthermore, release of TGFβ₁ from MVECs acts in a paracrine loop on cardiomyocytes and provokes apoptotic death. Thus, in myocardial infarction hypoxic endothelial cells may contribute to cardiac remodeling and heart failure progression by promotion of cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocytes death.",

Together with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), Zn(2+) covers biological regulation with redox-inert metal ions over many orders of magnitude in concentrations. The regulatory functions of zinc ions, together with their functions as a cofactor in about three thousand zinc metalloproteins, impact virtually all aspects of cell biology. This article attempts to define the regulatory functions of zinc ions, and focuses on the nature of zinc signals and zinc signalling in pathways where zinc ions are either extracellular stimuli or intracellular messengers. These pathways interact with Ca(2+), redox, and phosphorylation signalling. The regulatory functions of zinc require a complex system of precise homeostatic control for transients, subcellular distribution and traffic, organellar homeostasis, and vesicular storage and exocytosis of zinc ions.",

    "articleAbstract": "The synthetic curcumin analogue, 3,5-bis[(2-fluorophenyl)methylene]-4-piperidinone (EF-24), suppresses NF-κB activity and exhibits antiproliferative effects against a variety of cancer cells in vitro. Recently, it was reported that EF-24-induced apoptosis was mediated by a redox-dependent mechanism. Here, we studied the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on EF-24-induced cell death. We also addressed the question of whether the main drug transporters, ABCB1 and ABCG2, affect the cytotoxic of EF-24. We observed that EF-24 induced cell death with apoptotic hallmarks in human leukemia K562 cells. Importantly, the loss of cell viability was preceded by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and by a decrease of reduced glutathione (GSH). However, neither ROS production nor the decrease in GSH predominantly contributed to the EF-24-induced cell death. We found that EF-24 formed an adduct with GSH, which is likely the mechanism contributing to the decrease of GSH. Although NAC abrogated ROS production, decreased GSH and prevented cell death, its protective effect was mainly due to a rapid conversion of intra- and extra-cellular EF-24 into the EF-24-NAC adduct without cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, we found that neither overexpression of ABCB1 nor ABCG2 reduced the antiproliferative effects of EF-24. In conclusion, a redox-dependent-mediated mechanism only marginally contributes to the EF-24-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. The main mechanism of NAC protection against EF-24-induced apoptosis is conversion of cytotoxic EF-24 into the noncytotoxic EF-24-NAC adduct. Neither ABCB1 nor ABCG2 mediated resistance to EF-24.",

Moreover, this novel CRISPR/Cas can be used for zygote-mediated knock-in at a unique locus, suggesting that this system could help to expand the feasibility of the zygote-mediated generation of genome-modified animals.",

    "articleAbstract": "In this study, crude Cortex Periplocae polysaccharides (CCPPs) were extracted with water. CCPPs were decolored with AB-8 resin and deproteinated using papain-Sevage methods. Then, they were further purified and separated through DEAE-52 anion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography, respectively. Three main fractions-CPP1, CPP2, and CPP3, (CPPs)-were obtained. The average molecular weights, monosaccharide analysis, surface morphology, and chemical compositions of the CPPs were investigated by high-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In addition, the antioxidant activities of these three polysaccharides were investigated. The results indicated that all of the CPPs were composed of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, and galactose. These three polysaccharides exhibited antioxidant activities in four assays including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical, reducing power, and total antioxidant activity in vitro. The data indicated that these three polysaccharides could be utilized as potential natural sources of alternative additives in the functional food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.",

However, its role in the flavonoid metabolism in C. sinensis has not been well studied. In this study, we cloned two F3Hs from C. sinensis, named CsF3Ha and CsF3Hb, where CsF3Ha containing 1107 bases encoded 368 amino acids, and CsF3Hb containing 1071 bases encoded 357 amino acids. Enzymatic activity analysis showed both recombinant CsF3H enzymes in Escherichia coli could convert naringenin and eriodictyol into dihydrokaempferol (DHK) and dihydroquercetin (DHQ), respectively. The expression profiles showed that CsF3Ha and CsF3Hb were highly expressed in the tender leaves of tea plants. Under different abiotic stresses, the two CsF3Hs were induced remarkably by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, sucrose, and abscisic acid (ABA). In the seeds of CsF3Hs transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, the concentration of most flavonol glycosides and oligomeric proanthocyanidins increased significantly, while the content of monocatechin derivatives decreased. The present study revealed that CsF3Hs played critical roles in flavonoid biosynthesis in tea plants.",

However, conventional conjugation strategies lead to heterogeneous conjugates with undefined stoichiometry and sites, even with considerable batch-to-batch variability. In this study, we have developed a chemo-enzymatic strategy by equipping the C-terminus of anti-CD20 ofatumumab with a click handle using Sortase A, followed by ligation of the payload based on a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition to produce homogeneous conjugates. The resulting antibody-drug conjugates fully retained their antigen binding capability and proved to be internalized and trafficked to the lysosome, which released the payload with a favorable efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this reported method is a versatile tool with maximum flexibility for development of antibody-drug conjugates and protein modification.",

The chemical composition and morphologies of the as-prepared Co₃O₄ nanoparticles were extensively characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Varying the temperature caused considerable changes in the morphology, the electrochemical performance increased with rising temperature, and the redox reactions become more reversible. The results showed that the Co₃O₄ synthesized at a higher temperature (180 °C) demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 833 F/g. This is attributed to the optimal temperature and the controlled growth of nanocubes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is a recent invasive pest of soft fruits in North and South America and Europe. Control relies on frequent applications of synthetic insecticides. Additional tactics are needed for development of an effective integrated pest management program. Study objectives were to evaluate the repellency and oviposition deterrent capability of compounds in plant essential oils and the effect of select compounds on infestation rates in strawberries, using laminate polymer flakes as a carrier. Of 14 compounds from 5 essential oils, thymol was the most repellent to adult D. suzukii males and females for up to 24 h in the laboratory. Citronellol, geraniol and menthol were moderately repellent. In a choice assay, thymol on cotton wicks adjacent to ripe raspberries reduced female fly landings and larval infestation levels. In a no-choice assay, thymol reduced female fly landings by 60%, larval infestation by 50% and increased fly mortality compared to controls. Neither citronellol alone nor a blend of four repellent compounds was as effective as thymol alone at reducing fly landing, larval infestation, or increasing fly mortality. In a choice assay using polymer flakes, larval infestation was greater in raspberries near untreated flakes than in raspberries near flakes treated with thymol or peppermint oil. In the field, thymol and peppermint flakes reduced larval infestation levels by 25% in strawberries at 4, but not 7, days after application, compared to untreated flakes. With future improvements in application strategies, deterrent compounds may have a role in improving the management of D. suzukii.",

As this research shows, oxyresveratrol and two cyclodextrins (CDs) were able to form inclusion complexes in a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the interaction with HP-β-CD was more efficient, showing up as higher encapsulation constant (KF) (35,864.72 ± 3415.89 M(-1)). The KF values exhibited a strong dependence on temperature and pH, which decreased as they increased. From the thermodynamic parameters (ΔH⁰, ΔS⁰, and ΔG⁰) of the oxyresveratrol loaded β-CD (oxyresveratrol-β-CD) and HP-β-CD (oxyresveratrol-HP-β-CD), it could be seen that the complexation process was spontaneous and exothermic, and the main driving forces between oxyrsveratrol and CDs were hydrogen bonding and van der waals force. Besides, molecular docking combined with ¹H-NMR were used to explain the most possible mode of interactions between oxyresveratrol and CDs.",

    "articleAbstract": "5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been extensively studied since its initial development in the 1950s. It has been suggested that the mechanism of action of 5-FU involves both DNA- and RNA-directed processes, but this has remained controversial. In this study, using a series of in vivo reporter constructs capable of measuring translational recoding, we demonstrate that cells exposed to 5-FU display a reduced capacity to engage in a variety of translational recoding events, including +1 programmed frameshifting (PRF) and -1 PRF. In addition, 5-FU-treated cells are much less accurate at stop codon recognition, resulting in a significant increase in stop codon-readthrough. Remarkably, while the efficiency of cap-dependent translation appears to be unaffected by 5-FU, 5-FU-treated cells display a decreased ability to initiate cap-independent translation. We further show that knockdown of thymidylate synthase, an enzyme believed to be at the center of 5-FU-induced DNA damage, has no effect on the observed alterations in translational recoding. On the other hand, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) pseudouridylation, which plays an important role in translational recoding, is significantly inhibited. Taken together, our results suggest that the observed effect of 5-FU on recoding is an RNA-directed effect. Our results are the first to show definitely and quantitatively that translational recoding is affected by exposure to 5-FU. Thus, it is possible that a substantial portion of 5-FU cytotoxicity might possibly be the result of alterations in translational recoding efficiency.",

Complete success was resolution of bleb leak and or hypotony with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥5 and ≤21 mm Hg with no anti-glaucoma medication.There were 45 eyes with leaking bleb and 31 eyes with sweating bleb that underwent bleb repair by either conjunctival autograft or conjunctival advancement (P=0.11). Prior to bleb repair, complications like blebitis and hypotony maculopathy were significantly higher in sweating bleb group (13/31) compared to bleb leak group (5/45) (P=0.002). Median follow up after bleb repair was >2 years in both groups (P=0.69). Post repair, eyes in leaking bleb group had higher immediate (P=0.01) and long term IOP elevation (P=0.06) compared to sweating bleb group. Complete success probability in sweating bleb group was significantly better (88%, 78% and 71%) compared to leaking bleb group (54%, 45% and 40%) at 1, 3 and 6 years respectively (P=0.01). One eye in each group had blebitis, two eyes in leaking bleb group and one eye in sweating bleb group needed repeat glaucoma intervention.Higher complication rate prior to bleb repair in eyes with sweating bleb warrants early bleb repair. Bleb repair helped retain bleb function in majority of the eyes with sweating blebs, strengthening our recommendation.",

All four patients developed either symptomatic or progressive extrusion. Operative repair was completed with Su-Por® removal and replacement with a new human donor patch graft. No patient developed any sign of infection despite the extrusions. The remaining seven patients had an uneventful postoperative course and continue to have no complications from the Su-Por® patch with 9 months of follow-up.Given the high rate of extrusion of the Su-Por® graft, this material appears to be an inadequate alternative for covering tube shunts. Harvested human tissue or other more flexible, manufactured grafts remain the standard of care for covering tube shunts.",

Both cases displayed bilateral disc dragging with evidence of avascular retinae on fundus fluorescein angiography. Retinal laser photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections provided satisfactory regression of the neovascularisation. Medical management of glaucoma was administered to both patients. Lens aspiration with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed for one eye of each patient. It helped in clearing media as well as in increasing anterior chamber depth, helping in indirect control of IOP. Though the primary pathology of FEVR lies in the retina, a comprehensive glaucoma screening is essential. We conclude that neovascular glaucoma albeit uncommon in FEVR, may be the presenting feature in advanced unlasered cases, and should be specifically looked for.",

    "articleAbstract": "The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse event profile of two trabecular micro-bypass stents implanted during standard phacoemulsification cataract surgery in patients with mild to advanced open-angle glaucoma whose IOP is well-controlled by topical medications.This study was a retrospective analysis of patients with mild-to-advanced chronic open-angle glaucoma who underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of two stents. For all patients, pre- and postoperative characteristics were evaluated including numbers of medications and IOP. Postoperative visits were scheduled at 7 days and at months 1, 6, 12 and 24 after surgery. At each visit, IOP and the number of medications were noted.Sixty-three eyes of 41 patients were included in the study. The vast majority of eyes (85.7%) were diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Preoperative mean IOP at baseline was 16.8±3.0 mm Hg (range, 10-24 mm Hg) with a mean of 2.3±0.9 medications. The mean IOP reduction represented a 13% decrease at 1 month (P<0.001), 13% at 6 months (P<0.001), 12% at 1 year (P<0.001), 10% at 2 years (P<0.001) concomitant with a 23% reduction in the mean number of medications (P<0.001), 35% (P<0.001), 40% (P<0.001) and 40% (P<0.001), respectively, at each scheduled follow-up visit. At 24 months postoperatively, 19 of 23 (83%) patients experienced an IOP decrease compared to the preoperative visit. No severe device-related adverse events were observed.Patients with mild-to-advanced glaucoma can benefit from micro-bypass implantation even if their IOP is well controlled with topical hypotensive medications. Expectations for these reductions should be moderate.",

Excision of fibrotic tissue around the reservoir with application of mitomycin C 0.02% was performed. IOP, number of glaucoma medications were evaluated at baseline and 1 week and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Complete and qualified success was defined as IOP≤21 mm Hg with or without glaucoma medications, respectively. Intraoperative and postopervative complications were also recorded.Mean IOP was reduced from 30±4.2 mm Hg at baseline to 19.2±3.1 mm Hg at 12 months follow up visit (P<0.001). Average number of glaucoma medications was decrease from 3.2±0.5 at baseline to 1.9±0.7 at 12 months follow up (P<0.001). Qualified and complete success rates at 12 months follow up were 65.5% and 6.9%, respectively. Younger age and higher number of previous glaucoma surgeries were significantly associated with the failure of excisonal bleb revision.Excisional bleb revision could be considered as a relatively effective alternative option for management of inadequate IOP control after AGV implantation.",

    "articleAbstract": "In 2017, approximately 90% of U.S. orthopaedic residents chose to participate in orthopaedic fellowships. The process of applying and interviewing for an orthopaedic fellowship is expensive and time-consuming for both orthopaedic residents and orthopaedic residency programs. Considerable physician man-hours are allocated to fellowship interviews and the match ranking process, and there are unintended consequences of time away from work for the resident and his or her training program. To reduce time and cost allocated to fellowship interviews, we implemented videoconference interviews for our adult reconstruction fellowship. The purpose of this article was to communicate the lessons that we learned about this innovation.Candidates and faculty who participated in videoconference interviews for our adult reconstruction fellowship during 2015 through 2017 were surveyed to learn more about the utility and acceptance of videoconference interviewing.Eighty-five percent of the 47 videoconference interview candidates who responded to our survey believed that the videoconference interviews gave them a satisfactory understanding of our adult reconstruction fellowship; 85% of candidates stated that the fellowship manual and the videoconference interviews gave them a satisfactory understanding of our fellowship; 89% of candidates stated that the videoconference interview met their expectations; 85% of candidates believed that the videoconference interviews allowed them to present themselves to the program to their satisfaction; and 81% of candidates were comfortable ranking our program after the videoconference interviews. Furthermore, there was universal gratitude in the subjective comments for the convenience and low cost of the videoconference interviews. However, we are concerned that 15% of the candidates did not believe that they had the opportunity to present themselves to their satisfaction with videoconference interviews; 19% of applicants were not comfortable ranking our program after a videoconference interviews; 34% of videoconference interview candidates stated that the videoconference interviews had an unfavorable impact on their ranking of our program; and 30% of candidates believed that the videoconference interview was not a good format for fellowship interviews.This review presents what we learned about using videoconference interviews for evaluating and selecting adult reconstruction fellows. The role of videoconference interviews for selecting adult reconstruction fellows remains to be determined.",

    "articleAbstract": "In the past 2 decades, overdoses and deaths from prescription opioids have reached epidemic proportions in the United States. The widespread use of opioids complicates management of the orthopaedic surgery patient in the acute and chronic settings. Orthopaedic surgeons are some of the top prescribers of opioids in the complex setting of chronic use, abuse, and diversion.The literature regarding the basic science of pharmacologic options for pain management (e.g., opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), the impact of strategies on bone and soft-tissue healing, and pain relief are summarized as they relate to the management of orthopaedic injuries and conditions. Additionally, a section on designing solutions to address the current opioid crisis is presented.The mechanism of action of different classes of analgesic medications is discussed, as well as the basic scientific evidence regarding the impact of narcotic and nonnarcotic analgesic medications on bone-healing and on other organ systems. Differences between pain and nociception, various treatment strategies, and clinical comparisons of the effectiveness of various analgesics compared with opioids are summarized. Finally, options for addressing the opioid crisis, including the description of a large system-wide intervention to impact prescriber behavior at the point of care using health-information solutions, are presented.Orthopaedic leaders, armed with information and strategies, can help lead the way to solutions to the opioid epidemic in their respective communities, institutions, and subspecialty societies. Through leadership and education, orthopaedic surgeons can help shape the solution for this critical public health issue.",

    "articleAbstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed in the U.S. The purpose of this study was to develop and verify a scale to preoperatively stratify a patient's risk of being readmitted to the hospital following a TKA.Discharge data on 433,638 patients from New York and California (derivation cohort) and 269,934 patients from Florida and Washington (validation cohort) who underwent TKA were collected from the State Inpatient Database, a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2006 to 2011). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were abstracted and analyzed to develop the Readmission After Total Knee Arthroplasty (RATKA) Scale.Overall 30-day readmission rates in the derivation and validation cohorts were 5.11% and 4.98%, respectively. The following factors were significantly associated with increased 30-day readmission rates in the derivation cohort: age of 41 to 50 years (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13), age of 71 to 80 years (OR = 1.21), age of 81 to 90 years (OR = 1.70), male sex (OR = 1.19), African-American race (OR = 1.37), \"other\" race/ethnicity (OR = 1.08), Medicaid payer (OR = 1.43), Medicare payer (OR = 1.27), anemia (OR = 1.19), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 1.29), coagulopathy (OR = 1.22), congestive heart failure (OR = 1.64), diabetes (OR = 1.19), fluid and electrolyte disorder (OR = 1.25), hypertension (OR = 1.10), liver disease (OR = 1.27), renal failure (OR = 1.33), and rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 1.14). These factors were used to create the RATKA Scale. The RATKA score was then used to define 3 levels of risk for readmission: low (RATKA score of <13; 3.7% readmission rate), moderate (RATKA score of 13 to 16; 5.4% readmission rate), and high (RATKA score of >16; 7.6% readmission rate). The relative risk of readmission was 2.06 for the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group.The RATKA Scale derived from patient data from the derivation cohort was reliably able to explain readmission variability after TKA for patients in the validation cohort at a rate of >95%. Models such as the RATKA Scale will enable identification of the risk of readmission following TKA based on a patient's risk profile prior to surgery.Prognostic Level III.

    "articleAbstract": "Hoffa fractures, coronal-plane fractures involving the distal femoral condyles, are unstable, intra-articular fractures. The aim of this study was to define the location and frequency of fracture lines and comminution zones in Hoffa fractures using computed tomography (CT) mapping in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional contexts.Seventy-five Hoffa fractures (OTA/AO types 33B3.2 and 33B3.3) were retrospectively reviewed. The directions of fracture lines were characterized in the axial and sagittal CT planes. CT images for all fractures were superimposed on one another and oriented to fit a standard template. Mapping of fracture lines and comminution zones in both the axial and sagittal planes was performed. A 3-dimensional map was created by reducing reconstructed fracture fragments to fit to a model of the distal aspect of the femur.This study included 1 bicondylar and 74 unicondylar (26 medial and 48 lateral) Hoffa fractures. Comminuted fractures accounted for 35.5% of all fractures and 44.9% of lateral fractures. Axial fracture mapping demonstrated that fracture lines were concentrated in the middle-third area of the lateral condyle but were less concentrated and with greater variation in the medial condyle. The mean angle of fracture lines with respect to the posterior condylar axis was 34.4° and 29.0° in the lateral and medial femoral condyles, respectively. Sagittal fracture mapping also demonstrated that fracture lines were concentrated in the middle third of the lateral condyle but were less concentrated in the medial condyle. The mean angle of fracture lines with respect to the posterior cortex of the distal femoral shaft was 23.1° and 19.3° in the lateral and medial condyles, respectively. Three-dimensional mapping demonstrated comminution zones commonly occurring in the weight-bearing zone of the lateral condylar articular surface.Hoffa fractures occurred more frequently in the lateral femoral condyle. In the axial plane, fractures commonly extended from anterolateral to posteromedial in the lateral condyle and from anteromedial to posterolateral in the medial femoral condyle. In the sagittal plane, fractures traversed from anteroinferior to posterosuperior. Articular comminution was more commonly seen in lateral condylar fractures and concentrated in the weight-bearing zone of the articular surface.Research in this area is imperative for optimal preoperative planning, such as for the selection of surgical approach and fixation constructs. Our findings lend insight into fracture morphology, which can assist with fracture classification and the design of biomechanical studies, ultimately aiding in treatment.",

    "articleAbstract": "Elbow contractures can cause functional limitation, and treatment can be challenging. The purpose of this article is to describe a novel technique that releases posttraumatic elbow contractures through an olecranon osteotomy and report the outcomes.Thirty-five patients with refractory posttraumatic elbow contracture who underwent an olecranon osteotomy-facilitated elbow release (OFER) procedure were included in the study. The average patient age was 39.5 years (range, 18 to 63 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 37.2 months (range, 24 to 72 months). Preoperative and postoperative data included age, sex, cause of contracture, previous surgical procedures, active elbow range of motion, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores, visual analog scale pain scores, and radiographs. Intraoperative tourniquet time and complications were recorded.The mean preoperative elbow motion arc was 33° (51° to 84° of flexion). Postoperatively, the motion arc improved significantly (p < 0.001) to 110° (16° to 126° of flexion). The mean visual analog pain scale score improved from 6.3 preoperatively to 1.4 at the time of follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean DASH score improved from 57.5 preoperatively to 10.9 postoperatively (p < 0.001). The maximal improvement in the motion arc occurred at a mean of 8.7 weeks. There was 1 postoperative ulnar neurapraxia that resolved spontaneously. The intraoperative tourniquet time averaged 27 minutes (range, 18 to 45 minutes). The average time until radiographic evidence of union of the olecranon osteotomy site was 6.6 weeks (range, 5.7 to 7.7 weeks).The OFER is a safe and effective means of treating posttraumatic elbow contractures, and is an alternative to traditional open or arthroscopic techniques.Therapeutic Level IV.

    "articleAbstract": "Adequate irrigation of open musculoskeletal injuries is considered the standard of care to decrease bacterial load and other contaminants. While the benefit of debris removal compared with the risk of further seeding by high-pressure lavage has been studied, the effects of irrigation on muscle have been infrequently reported. Our aim in the present study was to assess relative damage to muscle by pulsatile lavage compared with bulb-syringe irrigation.In an animal model of heterotopic ossification, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hindlimb blast amputation via detonation of a submerged explosive, with subsequent through-the-knee surgical amputation proximal to the zone of injury. All wounds were irrigated and underwent primary closure. In 12 of the animals, pulsatile lavage (20 psi [138 kPa]) was used as the irrigation method, and in the other 12 animals, bulb-syringe irrigation was performed. A third group of 6 rats did not undergo the blast procedure but instead underwent surgical incision into the left thigh muscle followed by pulsatile lavage. Serial radiographs of the animals were made to monitor the formation of soft-tissue radiopaque lesions until euthanasia at 6 months. Image-guided muscle biopsies were performed at 8 weeks and 6 months (at euthanasia) on representative animals from each group. Histological analysis was performed with hematoxylin and eosin, alizarin red, and von Kossa staining on interval biopsy and postmortem specimens.All animals managed with pulsatile lavage, with or without blast injury, developed soft-tissue radiopaque lesions, whereas no animal that had bulb-syringe irrigation developed these lesions (p = 0.001). Five of the 12 animals that underwent blast amputation with pulsatile lavage experienced wound complications, whereas no animal in the other 2 groups experienced wound complications (p = 0.014). Radiopaque lesions appeared approximately 10 days postoperatively, increased in density until approximately 16 weeks, then demonstrated signs of variable regression. Histological analysis of interval biopsy and postmortem specimens demonstrated tissue damage with inflammatory cells, cell death, and dystrophic calcification.Pulsatile lavage of musculoskeletal wounds can cause irreversible insult to tissue, resulting in myonecrosis and dystrophic calcification.The benefits and offsetting harm of pulsatile lavage (20 psi) should be considered before its routine use in the management of musculoskeletal wounds.",

    "articleAbstract": "There is increasing interest in surgeon \"performance measures.\" Understanding patient factors that increase the risk of adverse events is important for the comparison of such metrics among surgeons and centers. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether patient characteristics, beyond the control of the surgeon, were associated with increased risk of postoperative infection following posterior spinal fusion for the correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and to establish a \"risk-adjusted\" method of reporting postoperative infection rates.We reviewed the data of patients from 14 participating scoliosis treatment centers who experienced an infection within 90 days following posterior spinal fusion for the treatment of AIS. Patients with a deep infection (irrigation and debridement performed) were compared with those without an infection with regard to age, sex, body mass index (BMI) percentile for age, Lenke classification of curve type, primary curve magnitude, and estimated 3-dimensional sagittal kyphosis (T5-T12). A regression model was created to identify variables that were associated with infection, and the performance of the risk model was evaluated. The actual infection rate by site was divided by the predicted infection rate for that site and multiplied by the overall rate to create a risk-adjusted rate.Of 2,122 patients analyzed, 21 (1.0%) had an infection within 90 days following surgery. Obesity was the only significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 7.6; p ≤ 0.001), with the resultant model demonstrating good discrimination and calibration. For the 8 sites that enrolled ≥100 patients, the predicted infection rates based on the proportion of obese patients ranged from 0.8% to 1.2%. The range of the risk-adjusted infection rates varied more substantially, from 0.2% to 2.0%.For the posterior approach to surgical correction of AIS, the only identified patient risk factor for postoperative infection was a BMI percentile for age of ≥95%. To assess infection rates, we suggest adjusting for the proportion of obese patients in the cohort. A risk-adjusted infection rate for posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation for AIS allows for more accurate assessment of performance and comparison among centers.Therapeutic Level III.

    "articleAbstract": "Debate surrounds the issue of whether peripheral nerve blockade or periarticular infiltration (PAI) should be employed within a contemporary, comprehensive multimodal analgesia pathway for total hip arthroplasty. We hypothesized that patients treated with a continuous posterior lumbar plexus block (PNB) would report less pain and consume less opioid medication than those treated with PAI.This investigator-initiated, independently funded, 3-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) performed at a single high-volume institution compared postoperative analgesia interventions for elective, unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty: (1) PNB; (2) PAI with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and epinephrine (PAI-R); and (3) PAI with liposomal bupivacaine, ketorolac, and epinephrine (PAI-L) using computerized randomization. The primary outcome was maximum pain during the morning (06:00 to 12:00) of the first postoperative day (POD) on an ascending numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10. Pairwise treatment comparisons were performed using the rank-sum test, with a p value of <0.017 indicating significance (Bonferroni adjusted). A sample size of 150 provided 80% power to detect a difference of 2.0 NRS units.We included 159 patients (51, 54, and 54 patients in the PNB, PAI-R, and PAI-L groups, respectively). No significant differences were found with respect to the primary end point on the morning of the first POD (median, 3.0, 4.0, and 3.0, respectively; p > 0.033 for all). Opioid consumption was low and did not differ across groups at any intervals. Median maximum pain on POD 1 was 5.0, 5.5, and 4.0, respectively, and was lower for the PAI-L group than for the PAI-R group (p = 0.006). On POD 2, maximum pain (median, 3.5, 5.0, and 3.5, respectively) was lower for the PNB group (p = 0.014) and PAI-L group (p = 0.016) compared with the PAI-R group. The PAI-L group was not significantly different from the PNB group with respect to any outcomes: postoperative opioid use including rescue intravenous opioid medication, length of stay, and hospital adverse events, and 3-month follow-up data including any complication.In this RCT, we found a modest improvement with respect to analgesia in patients receiving PNB compared with those receiving PAI-R, but not compared with those who had PAI-L. Secondary analyses suggested that PNB or PAI-L provides superior postoperative analgesia compared with PAI-R. For primary total hip arthroplasty, a multimodal analgesic regimen including PNB or PAI-L provides opioid-limiting analgesia.Therapeutic Level I.

    "articleAbstract": "High failure rates of metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants prompted regulatory authorities to issue worldwide safety alerts. Circulating cobalt from these implants causes rare but fatal autopsy-diagnosed cardiotoxicity. There is concern that milder cardiotoxicity may be common and underrecognized. Although blood metal ion levels are easily measured and can be used to track local toxicity, there are no noninvasive tests for organ deposition. We sought to detect correlation between blood metal ions and a comprehensive panel of established markers of early cardiotoxicity.Ninety patients were recruited into this prospective single-center blinded study. Patients were divided into 3 age and sex-matched groups according to implant type and whole-blood metal ion levels. Group-A patients had a ceramic-on-ceramic [CoC] bearing; Group B, an MoM bearing and low blood metal ion levels; and Group C, an MoM bearing and high blood metal-ion levels. All patients underwent detailed cardiovascular phenotyping using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with T2*, T1, and extracellular volume mapping; echocardiography; and cardiac blood biomarker sampling. T2* is a novel CMR biomarker of tissue metal loading.Blood cobalt levels differed significantly among groups A, B, and C (mean and standard deviation [SD], 0.17 ± 0.08, 2.47 ± 1.81, and 30.0 ± 29.1 ppb, respectively) and between group A and groups B and C combined. No significant between-group differences were found in the left atrial or ventricle size, ejection fraction (on CMR or echocardiography), T1 or T2* values, extracellular volume, B-type natriuretic peptide level, or troponin level, and all values were within normal ranges. There was no relationship between cobalt levels and ejection fraction (R = 0.022, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.185 to 0.229) or T2* values (R = 0.108, 95% CI = -0.105 to 0.312).Using the best available technologies, we did not find that high (but not extreme) blood cobalt and chromium levels had any significant cardiotoxic effect on patients with an MoM hip implant. There were negligible-to-weak correlations between elevated blood metal ion levels and ejection fraction even at the extremes of the 95% CI, which excludes any clinically important association.Therapeutic Level II.

    "articleAbstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the rate and risk factors associated with the development of acute kidney injury after total hip arthroplasty, including the perioperative use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).We retrospectively collected the demographic and comorbidity data of all patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty between 2004 and 2014 at our institution (n = 8,949). We conducted analyses of the entire cohort and a nested case-control subset. Subjects who developed acute kidney injury were matched by age, sex, and year of surgical procedure to subjects without acute kidney injury. Variables associated with acute kidney injury were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions.The mean patient age (and standard deviation) was 64.6 ± 13.8 years, 48.6% of patients were male, and 114 cases (1.1%) developed acute kidney injury, mostly stage 1 (79%). Variables associated with acute kidney injury included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.4 per decade; p < 0.001), male sex (OR, 1.78; p = 0.005), chronic kidney disease (OR, 4.6; p < 0.001), heart failure (OR, 4.5; p < 0.001), diabetes (OR, 2.1; p < 0.001), and hypertension (OR, 2.1; p = 0.007). The results were consistent in the case-control analysis. NSAIDs were not associated with acute kidney injury (OR, 1.26; p = 0.36), but were avoided in subjects at risk, making any interpretation difficult because of confounding. A risk model for acute kidney injury after total hip arthroplasty was developed for clinical use and had good discrimination (area under the curve, 0.82; p < 0.001).The rate of acute kidney injury after total hip arthroplasty is low, but increases significantly, from <1% to >20%, in those with several independent risk factors present preoperatively. Increasing awareness of these risk factors may help to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury after total hip arthroplasty.Therapeutic Level III.

    "articleAbstract": "While obesity may be a risk factor for complications following total knee arthroplasty, data remain sparse on the impact of the degree of obesity on patient-reported outcomes following this procedure. Our objective was to determine the extent to which obesity level affects the trajectory of recovery as well as patient-reported pain, function, and satisfaction with surgery following total knee arthroplasty.We followed a cohort of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty at 1 of 4 medical centers. Patients were ≥40 years of age with a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis. We stratified patients into 5 groups according to the World Health Organization classification of body mass index (BMI). We assessed the association between BMI group and pain and function over the time intervals of 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 24 months using a piecewise linear model. We also assessed the association between BMI group and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months. Multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race, diabetes, musculoskeletal functional limitations index, pain medication use, and study site.Of the 633 participants included in our analysis, 19% were normal weight (BMI of <25 kg/m), 32% were overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m), 27% were class-I obese (BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m), 12% were class-II obese (BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m), and 9% were class-III obese (BMI of ≥40 kg/m). Study participants with a higher BMI had worse preoperative WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain and function scores and had greater improvement from baseline to 3 months. The mean change in pain and function from 3 to 6 and from 6 to 24 months was similar across all BMI groups. At 24 months, participants in all BMI groups had similar levels of pain, function, and satisfaction.Because of the differential trajectory of recovery in the first 3 months following total knee arthroplasty, the participants in the higher BMI groups were able to attain absolute pain and function scores similar to those in the nonobese and class-I obese groups. These data can help surgeons discuss expectations of pain relief and functional improvement with total knee arthroplasty candidates with higher BMI.Prognostic Level III.

    "articleAbstract": "This study quantifies the rate of improvement after anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; a better understanding of the rate of improvement associated with each prosthesis type may better establish patient expectations for recovery.Prospectively collected data on 1,183 patients who underwent either anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (n = 505) or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (n = 678) were collected. The Simple Shoulder Test (SST), University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Constant, and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores, along with range of motion, were recorded preoperatively and at routine postoperative time points. All included patients had a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The rate of improvement of these outcome measures was quantified for patients who underwent anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and those who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty to compare recovery over time.In this study, 3,587 visits by 1,183 patients were analyzed and several differences between prosthesis types were noted. Patients who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty experienced larger improvements in the Constant score and active forward flexion, and patients who underwent anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty demonstrated better improvement in external rotation compared with patients who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty at nearly all time points. By 72 months, improvement in flexion and abduction decreased for each prosthesis type, but in particular for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Full improvement was achieved by 24 months, although the majority of improvement was achieved in the first 6 months, with all 5 scoring metrics following a similar rate of improvement. The ASES, SPADI, and UCLA Shoulder scores closely mirrored each other in the magnitude of improvement, and the SST score demonstrated the largest improvement and the Constant score demonstrated the smallest improvement for both anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.Both anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty reliably result in improved patient outcomes. However, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty more reliably improves range of motion, particularly external rotation. Most improvement occurs by 6 months, with some additional improvement up to 2 years for both anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Although the indications for anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty are substantially different, in addition to the biomechanical differences, the improvement in outcome scores over time can be expected to be very similar. This study is helpful to patients and health-care providers to establish expectations regarding the rate of recovery after total shoulder arthroplasty.Therapeutic Level III.

    "articleAbstract": "We analyzed self-reported outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients treated with ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement (TAR) during a time of transition from older to newer-generation TAR implants.We performed a prospective cohort study comparing outcomes in 273 consecutive patients treated for ankle arthritis with arthrodesis or TAR between 2005 and 2011. Adult patients with end-stage ankle arthritis who were able to walk and willing and able to respond to surveys were included in the study. Patients were excluded when they had another lower-limb problem that might affect walking. At baseline and at 6, 12, 24, and 36-month follow-up visits, participants completed a pain score, a Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (MFA), and a Short Form-36 (SF-36) survey.There was significant mean improvement in most outcomes after surgery regardless of procedure. In general, the greatest improvement occurred during the first 6 months of follow-up. Linear mixed-effects regression adjusted for differences at baseline in age, body mass index (BMI), and surgery type showed that at 6 months the scores were improved by a mean (and standard error) of 12.6 ± 0.7 (33%) on the MFA, 22.0 ± 1.4 (56%) on the SF-36 Physical Functioning (PF) scale, 32.4 ± 1.6 (93%) on the SF-36 Bodily Pain (BP) scale, and 4.0 ± 0.2 (63%) on the pain rating scale. The mean improvements in the MFA and SF-36 PF scores over the 3-year follow-up period were significantly better after the TARs than after the arthrodeses, with differences between the 2 groups of 3.6 ± 1.6 (p = 0.023) and 7.5 ± 2.9 (p = 0.0098), respectively. The differences between the 2 groups were slightly greater when only the newer TAR devices were compared with the arthrodeses (MFA = 3.8 ± 1.8 [p = 0.031], SF-36 PF = 8.8 ± 3.3 [p = 0.0074], SF-36 BP = 7.3 ± 3.6 [p = 0.045], and pain score = 0.8 ± 0.4 [p = 0.038]).Patients reported improved comfort and function after both surgical treatments. The average improvement in the MFA and SF-36 PF scores was better after TAR than after arthrodesis, particularly when the TAR had been done with later-generation implants. Younger patients had greater functional improvements than older patients.Therapeutic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",

    "articleAbstract": "California experienced pertussis epidemics in 2010 and 2014, with more than 9,000 and 11,000 reported cases, respectively. Using an ecologic study design, we compared age-specific pertussis incidence for persons ≤20 years of age in California in 2010 and 2014 to describe any changes in disease burden that may be attributable to changes in pertussis vaccination policy that occurred during inter-epidemic years.We evaluated California pertussis surveillance data for reported pertussis cases 20 years of age and younger with disease onset from January 1, 2010 -December 31, 2010 or January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2014. Age-specific pertussis rates were calculated for each of the epidemic years. Characteristics of each age group were compared across epidemic years and age-specific rate ratios (RRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.In both years, the highest disease rate was reported in infants <6 months of age; however, the incidence of pertussis declined significantly among infants <6 months of age in 2014 compared with 2010 (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63). Incidence remained stable among infants ≥6 months of age, children, and adolescents <12 years of age (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5-1.3). Adolescents 12-18 years of age had significantly higher rates of pertussis in 2014 compared to 2010, with the highest rates observed among 14-16 year-olds (RR 6.5, 95% CI 5.4-7.8).A 58% (53%-63%) reduction in pertussis incidence among infants <6 months of age in 2014 following the routine prenatal Tdap vaccination recommendation, suggested that an increase in prenatal Tdap coverage has been having some impact on infant pertussis. The excess number of cases observed in 2014 compared with 2010 occurred almost exclusively among the 12-17 year-old age group. Among older children, the peak age of pertussis is shifting, consistent with aging of the acellular pertussis vaccine cohort.",

    "articleAbstract": "Postoperative infection is a major complication of spinal surgery with implants. We aimed to identify risk factors for, and characteristics of, postoperative spinal infections in children.We performed a retrospective observational study of all children who underwent posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation in two referral hospitals in 2008-2013. Spinal infections were defined as local and/or general signs of infection that required surgical treatment in the early postoperative phase (i.e. within 30 days). Data were collected on a standardized questionnaire from medical charts.Of the 450 children who underwent spinal surgery, 26 (5.8%) were diagnosed with early postoperative spinal implant infection, with a median age of 14 years [interquartile range, 13-17], and a median delay of 13 days post-surgery [IQR, 7-18]. Postoperative infection was more common in children with neurologic scoliosis as compared with idiopathic scoliosis (12.2% (15/123) vs 2.4% (5/211); P<0.01). Neurologic scoliosis was an independent predictor of spinal implant infections (HR 3.87 [1.72-8.69]; P<0.001). Main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n=14), and Enterobacteriaceae (n=8). All children underwent early surgery (wound exploration, debridement, lavage), and antibiotics for a median duration of 19 weeks [IQR, 12-26]. Two children (7.7%) required a second surgery. Spinal implants could be retained in all, and no relapse occurred with a follow-up of >24 months after antibiotic discontinuation.Postoperative spinal implant infection is not rare in pediatric patients, especially with neurologic scoliosis. Most children may be cured with implant retention if managed with early surgery followed by a 3-months course of appropriate antibacterial agents.",

Of these, 1,691 women were included in the analysis. Total MRS and VMS ratings were compared using logistic regression, with age, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) included as covariates between women at intermediate/high risk versus low risk for OSA.Total MRS scores were significantly higher in women with intermediate/high-risk OSA scores versus those with low-risk scores [mean (SD): 16.8 (8.0) vs 12.9 (7.0), P < 0.001]. Women at intermediate/high OSA risk were older, had more education, self-reported hypertension, BMI >35 kg/m, and were less likely to be married or employed. Self-reported severe/very severe VMS were significantly associated with intermediate/high risk versus low risk for OSA (26.6% vs 15.0%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, and self-reported hypertension, the odds of having intermediate/high risk for OSA were 1.87 times higher for those with severe/very severe VMS compared with those with none/mild/moderate VMS (95% CI, 1.29-2.71, P < 0.001). This association persisted upon subgroup analysis based on BMI <25 kg/m (odds ratio 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.16, P = 0.022).Self-reported severe/very severe VMS were associated with intermediate/high risk for OSA in midlife women, even in women with BMI <25 kg/m. Given the limitations of the STOP-BANG tool, OSA risk may, however, have been overestimated.",

On average, endometrium was significantly less thick with CE 0.625 mg/BZA 20 mg than CE 0.625 mg (P < 0.001) and CE 0.3 mg/BZA 20 mg versus CE 0.3 mg (2.94 vs 3.92 mm, P < 0.05); endometrial thickness was similar to placebo with CE 0.625 mg/BZA 20 mg. Lower BZA doses failed to reduce endometrial thickness relative to the same dose of CE alone. Regimens containing CE 0.625 mg reduced HF frequency and severity versus placebo; CE 0.3 mg with BZA 10 or 20 mg was ineffective.BZA ≥20 mg is needed to counter endometrial growth resulting from treatment with CE 0.3 or 0.625 mg.

    "articleAbstract": "Aging and menopausal changes contribute to increased cardiovascular risks in postmenopausal women. This study examined the associations of total and specific fruit and vegetable consumption with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) status, a critical cardiovascular risk factor, in early postmenopausal Chinese women.A total of 508 postmenopausal Hong Kong Chinese women aged 50 to 64 years were recruited into a cohort study on cardiovascular risks. Sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions, use of medications, and lifestyle factors were obtained via structured interviews. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. LDL-C and total cholesterol concentrations were determined using biochemical enzymatic techniques and categorized according to the Adult Treatment Panel III classification.Ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that women with total fruit and vegetable intake in the highest quartile were 33% less likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.44-1.03) to have a worse LDL-C status than those with lower intake after adjustments. The intakes of total vegetables (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.96) and vegetable subgroups in the highest quartiles, including darkgreen leafy vegetables (OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.89) and corn and tubers (OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.96), were significantly inversely associated with LDL-C status. Further adjustment for total cholesterol did not attenuate the associations.A daily consumption of vegetables equivalent to about four servings or more might be beneficial for LDL-C control in early Chinese postmenopausal women. In particular, darkgreen leafy vegetables, as well as corn and tubers, deserve greater advocacy for their ability to improve lipid profiles and hence cardiovascular health.",

All participants were genotyped at the P2X7R rs2393799, rs7958311, rs1718119, rs2230911, and rs3751143 loci via allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism procedures. The relationships between P2X7R genetic polymorphisms and their associated haplotypes with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m] and overweight (25 kg/m ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m) were evaluated.Our results showed that P2X7R rs2230911G and rs1718119A were associated with an increased risk of obesity; in particular, both carriers of the rs2230911G allele and GG/(CG + GG) genotypes (G vs C, P < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98-4.16; GG vs CC, P < 0.001, OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.29-23.35; CG + GG vs CC, P < 0.001, OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.63-3.95) and carriers of the rs17181191A allele and GA/(GA + AA) genotypes (A vs G, P < 0.001, OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.86-4.74; GA vs GG, P = 0.001, OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.55-4.79; GA + AA vs GG, P < 0.001, OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.79-5.19) were at a higher risk of obesity. No association with obesity or overweight was observed for the other three P2X7R polymorphisms (rs2393799, rs7958311, and rs3751143). Haplotype analysis indicated that P2X7R rs1718119A-rs2230911G-rs3751143C appeared to be a significant risk haplotype with obesity (P = 0.0005, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.45-3.90).P2X7R functional genetic polymorphisms and their estimated haplotypes are associated with obesity in Chinese postmenopausal women.",

    "articleAbstract": "Women experience a variety of changes at midlife that may affect sexual function. Qualitative research approaches can allow a deeper understanding of women's experiences. We conducted 20 individual interviews and three focus groups among sexually active women aged 45 to 60 years (total n = 39) to explore how sexual function changes during midlife.Interviews and focus groups were conducted by a trained facilitator using a semistructured guide. All data were audio-recorded and transcribed. Two investigators used a subsample of data to iteratively develop a codebook. The primary investigator coded all data. A second investigator coded a randomly selected 25% of interviews. Codes regarding changes in sexual function were examined and key themes emerged.The mean age was 52, and most women were peri- or postmenopausal. Fifty-four per cent of women were white, 36% black, and 10% of another race. Participants discussed positive and negative changes in sexual function. The most common negative changes were decreased frequency of sex, low libido, vaginal dryness, and anorgasmia. Participants attributed negative changes to menopause, partner issues, and stress. Most participants responded to negative changes with adaptation, including changing sexual behavior and prioritizing different aspects of sex. Participants also reported positive changes, attributed to higher self-confidence, increased self-knowledge, and better communication skills with aging.In this qualitative study, women described experiencing both positive and negative changes in sexual function during midlife. When negative changes occurred, women often adapted behaviorally and psychologically. Providers should recognize that each woman's experience is unique and nuanced, and they should provide tailored care regarding sexual function at midlife.",

    "articleAbstract": "Postmenopausal women cite lack of time as their primary barrier to exercise and related weight control behaviors. The purpose of this study was to address this barrier via testing the feasibility and initial outcomes of a short-duration/high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-based weight loss program among obese postmenopausal women, with descriptive comparison to an endurance-focused exercise program.A 16-week behavioral program incorporated (1) HIIT to limit time necessary to produce health benefits of exercise, and (2) wearable activity sensors to facilitate self-monitoring exercise. Participants (n = 11; MAge = 59 ± 5.33; MBMI = 32.0 ± 2.53 kg/m) were randomly assigned to HIIT or endurance exercise. Both groups followed a calorie-restricted diet, attended monthly in-person meetings, weekly weigh-ins and electronic check-ins to review behavioral skills, and monitored their exercise with a Fitbit ChargeHR. Adherence to exercise programs, assessed with the Fitbit sensor, was used to determine feasibility.Participants in the HIIT group (6/6) adhered to their program, whereas 3 of 5 adhered to the Endurance program. Participants in the HIIT group lost twice as much weight as those in the Endurance group (8.7% vs 4.3% of initial body weight), and lost an additional 6 in. of body mass. In addition, only the HIIT group significantly changed fat mass, body mass index, and fat-free mass (Ps < 0.04).These findings support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of HIIT for weight loss and body composition changes in obese postmenopausal women, and indicate that additional investigation of this approach is warranted to reduce postmenopausal chronic disease risk.",

    "articleAbstract": "Cross-cultural validation of the Serbian version of the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES).This cross-sectional study involved 257 women aged 65 years and above who were referred for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry examination at the Railway Healthcare Institute in Belgrade, Serbia, between January and April 2016. Data collection comprised of a sociodemographic questionnaire and Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF) questionnaire, and data related to fractures, level of physical activity, use of medications that can increase the risk of falls, and frequency of falls in the past 12 months. None of the study participants had been previously treated for osteoporosis. The internal consistency of the questionnaire items was assessed via Cronbach's alpha, whereas the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to calculate test-retest reliability based on the sample of 257 women. We also evaluated concurrent, convergent, and construct validity.Cronbach's alpha for the total assay score was 0.98. Correlations among the items ranged from 0.84 to 0.93. While ICC for the scale as a whole was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.98-0.99), ICC pertaining to individual items ranged from 0.82 to 0.99. Concurrent validity analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between MFES scores and the reported level of physical activity (ρ = 0.34; P < 0.01). Convergent validity was tested through the ratio of MFES and sociodemographic variables. The findings indicated presence of a significant negative correlation between the MFES scores and age (ρ = -0.32; P < 0.01), age of menopause onset (ρ = -0.16; P = 0.01), and GDS-SF scores (ρ = -0.12; P = 0.04), and positive correlation between MFES and the level of social activity (ρ = 0.22; P < 0.01). Significant differences were noted between the MFES scores of participants who had no history fractures and those who did (U = 5277.50; P < 0.01), and between scores of women who reported falling in the past 12 months and those who did not (U = 4968.50; P < 0.01). Similarly, significant differences (P < 0.01) in the scores pertaining to each MFES item were observed between women who had experienced falls in the past (n = 101) and those who had not (n = 156).The Serbian version of the MFES is a reliable and valid instrument that can be used in both clinical practice and research to describe and measure self-perceived fear of falling in older individuals.",

    "articleAbstract": "Menopause is associated with adverse changes in hematological parameters. Although the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin E have been previously demonstrated, the effects of vitamin E on hematopoietic parameters are not well-documented. This study investigated the effects of supplemental vitamin E on hematological parameters in a rat model of ovarian hormone deficiency.Twelve-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were either sham-operated (Sham) or ovariectomized (Ovx). Animals were randomly divided among five treatment groups (n = 12/group) as follows: Sham; Ovx; Ovx + 300, Ovx + 525, or Ovx + 750 mg/kg diet of vitamin E for 100 days.Compared with Sham, ovariectomy increased leukocyte subpopulation counts including lymphocytes (2.01 × 10/mm; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11, 4.03; P = 0.03), monocytes (0.35 × 10/mm; 95% CI 0.60, 0.11; P = 0.01), neutrophils (0.72 × 10/mm; 95% CI 0.26, 1.19; P = 0.01), eosinophils (0.07 × 10/mm; 95% CI 0.12, 0.30; P = 0.00), and basophils (0.13 × 10/mm; 95% CI 0.04, 0.21; P = 0.02). Medium dose (MD) (-0.26 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.47, -0.05; P = 0.007) and high dose (HD) (-0.22 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.43, -0.01; P = 0.037) supplemental vitamin E attenuated Ovx-induced increases in monocyte counts. Low dose (LD) (-0.55 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.95, -0.15; P = 0.003), MD (-0.61 × 10/mm; P = 0.001), and HD (-0.54 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.95, -0.14; P = 0.004) supplemental vitamin E attenuated Ovx-induced increases in neutrophil counts. LD (-0.05 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.08, -0.11; P = 0.006), MD (-0.05 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.08, -0.11; P = 0.005), and HD (-0.05 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.09, -0.01; P = 0.004) supplemental vitamin E also attenuated the Ovx-induced increase in eosinophil counts. Only LD (-0.09 × 10/mm; 95% CI -0.17, -0.02; P = 0.009) supplemental vitamin E attenuated the Ovx-induced increase in basophil counts. The remaining hematological parameters assessed were not significantly affected by ovariectomy or supplemental vitamin E.These findings suggest that vitamin E in the form of α-tocopherol acetate may provide protection against ovarian hormone deficiency-associated adverse changes in hematological parameters.",

    "articleAbstract": "Lateral atlantoaxial osteoarthritis (AAOA), or C1-C2 lateral mass arthritis (LMA), is an unfamiliar degenerative cervical disease with a clinical presentation that markedly differs from subaxial spondylosis. The prevalence of LMA in the nonsurgical outpatient setting is 4%. Risk factors include age and occupation. The typical patient is between 50 and 90 years old, presents with upper cervical or occipital pain, has limited rotation, and has pain provocation during passive rotation to the affected side. Pain stems from degeneration of the lateral C1-C2 articulation and may be referred or radicular, through the greater occipital nerve. Although there is no consensus on diagnostic work-up, the disease is classically seen on the open-mouth odontoid radiograph. Computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scan, and diagnostic injections are also useful. Initial treatment is conservative, and upwards of two-thirds of LMA patients obtain lasting relief with noninvasive measures and injections. In patients with severe, recalcitrant pain, limited C1-C2 fusion offers satisfactory and reliable relief. The goals of this review article are to provide a synthesis of the literature on LMA, to offer a treatment approach to LMA, and to identify problems with the current state of knowledge on LMA.",

Indeed, preoperative rib hump has never been expressly evaluated as a prognostic factor of final thoracic curves angle.In total, 50 patients with Lenke 5 Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, selectively instrumented with posterior construct were included. Two patients were lost to follow-up and 48 had follow-up ≥2 years. Demographic data, preoperative thoracic rib hump (measured in millimeter in trunk anteflexion), and radiologic spinal parameters were recorded preoperatively and at last consultation. T test was used to compare mean values, linear and logistic regressions to assess predictability of final thoracic curve angle.Main thoracolumbar-lumbar curve angle decreased from 47 degrees (range, 36-72 degrees) to 12 degrees at the final consultation (range, 1-28 degrees). Thoracic curves angle decreased from 26 degrees (range, 2-40 degrees) preoperatively to 16 degrees (range, 2-41 degrees) at the final consultation (P=0.001) (correction=37%). Preoperative rib hump was present in 10 patients. Final thoracic Cobb angle was 27 degrees (8-41 degrees) in patients with rib hump and 14 degrees (0-32 degrees) in patients without rib hump (P<0.001).Multiregression highlighted thoracic curves angle on bending (P=0.001), preoperative thoracic curves angle (P=0.011) and rib hump (P=0.012) as prognostic factors of higher final thoracic curves angle.Rib hump significantly influenced final thoracic curves angle.Level III-prospective study.",

    "articleAbstract": "Prospective Cohort Study.The objective of this study is to evaluate and validate a patient-derived version of the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (the \"P-mJOA\") that a patient can complete along with other patient-derived outcome measures.The modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) is a validated instrument widely used in the assessment of cervical myelopathy; however, it is not a patient-derived outcome. If available and reliable, a patient-derived version of the mJOA (P-mJOA) could facilitate research because the data would be immediately available upon patient completion and also remove any potential physician bias. Currently, there is no patient-derived myelopathy survey with the widespread acceptance of the mJOA.The P-mJOA was created by very slightly modifying the verbiage of the mJOA to make it possible for a patient to complete the instrument while maintaining the questionnaire's core structure. A total of 100 consecutive consenting patients with cervical myelopathy were enrolled. After the patient completed the P-mJOA, the mJOA was scored by a physician blinded to the P-mJOA result.The P-mJOA and the mJOA had identical mean scores of 14.7 (mean difference±SD: 0.0±1.5; P=0.89). Several measures of reliability demonstrated agreement between the 2 surveys, including strong agreement with the intraclass correlation coefficient and Spearman ρ (both 0.83) and moderate to substantial agreement with weighted κ values (0.55 to 0.66). In addition, 67% of patients preferred to fill out the P-mJOA themselves, suggesting low patient burden.The P-mJOA provided identical mean scores to the mJOA in assessing myelopathy with moderate to strong agreement. Comprised of the same 4 questions as the mJOA but slightly reworded for patient comprehension, the P-mJOA also demonstrated low patient burden in completing the survey. We believe the P-mJOA is a promising tool in cervical myelopathy research with the benefits of a patient-derived outcome measure and low patient burden.Level II.",

    "articleAbstract": "Autologous bio-engineered dermo-epidermal skin substitutes are a promising treatment for large skin defects such as burns. For their successful clinical application, the graft dressing must protect and support the keratinocyte layer and, in many cases, possess antimicrobial properties. However, silver in many antimicrobial dressings may inhibit keratinocyte growth and differentiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of various wound dressings on the healing of a human hydrogel-based dermo-epidermal skin substitute in preparation for the first-in-human clinical trials. Human dermo-epidermal skin substitutes approved for clinical trials were produced under good manufacturing practice conditions, transplanted onto immuno-incompetent rats, and dressed with either Vaseline Gauze™ (Kendall Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA), Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany), Urgotul SSD (Urgo Medical, Shepshed, United Kingdom), Mepilex AG (Mölnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden), or Acticoat™ (Smith&Nephew, Baar, Switzerland). Grafts were assessed clinically for take, epithelialization, and infection at 10 and 21 days post-transplantation, and histologically at 21 days. There were three subjects each in the Vaseline Gauze™ and Suprathel groups, and four subjects each in the Urgotul SSD, Mepilex AG, and Acticoat™ groups. For all samples, the take rate was 100% and the expected keratinocyte number, epithelialization and epidermal stratification were observed. All of the dressings in the current study were well tolerated by our human dermo-epidermal skin substitute. The tolerance of the silver-based dressings is particularly relevant given the high risk of bacterial contamination with large skin defects, and provides pivotal information as we embark on clinical trials for this novel skin substitute.",

Women firefighters (n = 290) completed self-report measures of experiences with harassment on the job, career suicidality, and various psychiatric symptoms. Logistic regression analyses and one-way analyses of variance were used to address study aims. Of the sample, 21.7% reported having experienced sexual harassment and 20.3% reported having been threatened or harassed in another way on their firefighting job. Sexual harassment and other threats/harassment on the job were both significantly associated with a greater likelihood of reporting career suicidal ideation, as well as reporting more severe psychiatric symptoms. Harassment and threats experienced on the job may be associated with increased suicide risk and more severe psychiatric symptoms among women firefighters. Efforts are needed to reduce the occurrence of harassment and threats within the fire service and provide support for women firefighters who have been harassed or threatened.",

    "articleAbstract": "The diagnosis of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions is increasing in the general population because of the routine use of cross-sectional imaging modalities. Not all cysts are neoplastic, and the majority of cystic neoplasms have a low overall likelihood of progression to malignancy. Current management is based on imaging and cyst fluid analysis, but we are not able to diagnose the specific type of cyst and its malignant potential in a significant number of patients. Better diagnostic tools are required to avoid unnecessary surgical resections that carry an important risk of morbidity and mortality. Herein we review current evidence concerning the use of new endoscopic modalities for the evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions. We focus our discussion on the new cyst fluid markers, and the advancements on modalities such as confocal endomicroscopy, contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound, and the use of Spyglass. We also discuss the use of new devices to improve the cellular yield from cyst fluid and to obtain cyst-wall tissue, namely the cytology brush, the fine needle biopsy, and forceps for cyst-wall biopsy.",

    "articleAbstract": "There are few estimates of the effectiveness of long-standing vaccination programs in developed countries. To fill this gap, we investigate the direct and indirect effectiveness of childhood vaccination programs on mortality at the population level in the Netherlands.We focused on three communicable infectious diseases, diphtheria, pertussis, and poliomyelitis, for which we expect both direct and indirect effects. As a negative control, we used tetanus, a non-communicable infectious disease for which only direct effects are anticipated. Mortality data from 1903-2012 were obtained from Statistics Netherlands. Vaccination coverage data were obtained from various official reports. For the birth cohorts 1903 through 1975, all-cause and cause-specific childhood mortality burden was estimated using restricted mean lifetime survival methods, and a model was used to describe the pre-vaccination decline in burden. By projecting model results into the vaccination era, we obtained the expected burden without vaccination. Program effectiveness was estimated as the difference between observed and expected mortality burden.Each vaccination program showed a high overall effectiveness, increasing to nearly 100% within ten birth cohorts. For diphtheria, 14.9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 12.3%, 17.6%) of mortality burden averted by vaccination was due to indirect protection. For pertussis, this was 32.1% (95% UI: 31.3%, 32.8%). No indirect effects were observed for poliomyelitis or tetanus with -2.4% (UI: -16.7%, 7.1%) and 0.6% (UI: -17.9%, 10.7%) respectively.Vaccination programs for diphtheria and pertussis showed substantial indirect effects, providing evidence for herd protection.",

    "articleAbstract": "Extreme ambient temperatures have been linked to preterm birth. Preterm premature rupture of membranes is a common precursor to preterm birth but is rarely studied in relation to temperature.We linked 15 381 singleton pregnancies with premature rupture of membranes from a nationwide US obstetrics cohort (2002-2008) to local temperature. Case-crossover analyses compared daily temperature during the week preceding delivery and the day of delivery to two control periods, before and after the case period. Conditional logistic regression models calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of preterm and term premature rupture of membranes for a 1˚C increase in temperature during the warm (May-September) and cold (October-April) season separately after adjusting for humidity, barometric pressure, ozone and particulate matter.During the warm season, 1˚C increase during the week before delivery was associated with a 5% (95% CI: 3-6%) increased preterm premature rupture of membranes risk, and a 4% (95% CI: 3-5%) increased term premature rupture of membranes risk. During the cold season, 1˚C increase was associated with a 2% decreased risk for both preterm (95% CI: 1-3%) and term premature rupture of membranes (95% CI: 1-3%). The day-specific associations for the week before delivery were similar, but somewhat stronger for days closer to delivery.Relatively small ambient temperature changes were associated with the risk of both preterm and term premature of membranes. Given the adverse consequences of premature rupture of membranes and concerns over global climate change, these findings merit further investigation.",

    "articleAbstract": "Contact tracing can provide accurate information on relevant parameters of an ongoing emerging infectious disease outbreak. This is crucial to investigators seeking to control such an outbreak. However, crude contact tracing data are difficult to interpret and methods for analyzing these data are scarce. We present a method to estimate and visualize key outbreak parameters from contact tracing information in real time by taking into account data censoring.Exposure type-specific attack rates and the reproduction number R(t) are estimated from contact tracing data by using maximum likelihood estimation to account for censored data. The attack rates reflect, in the context of contact tracing, the specificity of the contact definition; a higher value indicates relatively efficient contact tracing. The evolution of R(t) over time provides information regarding the effectiveness of interventions. To allow a real-time overview of the outbreak, the attack rates and the evolution of R(t) over time are visualized together with the case-contact network and epicurve. We applied the method to a well-documented smallpox outbreak in the Netherlands, to demonstrate the added value.Our method facilitates the analysis of contact tracing information by quickly turning it into accessible information, helping outbreak investigators to make real-time decisions to more effectively and efficiently control infectious disease outbreaks.",

Thereafter, oxygen is an essential part of the treatment of trauma patients, but the mechanisms of its effects in the management of trauma patients remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to apply hypoxia, hyperoxia and other treatment with the goal of decreasing hypoxic neuronal cells damage, as reflected by cell survival, apoptosis, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF) expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Under hypoxic insults, cell survival percentages decreased and apoptosis was seen with increased necrotic cell death. High-pressure oxygen (80% O2) had no effect compared to normal-pressure oxygen (20% O2). After exposure to hypoxia, H2O2 production and levels of HIF significantly increased compared to normoxia. However, when pentoxifylline (PTX), steroid and hypertonic saline (HTS) were added after exposure to hypoxic conditions, the production of H2O2 and HIF levels significantly decreased in the groups treated with PTX and HTS. That is, the neuroprotective effect of PTX and HTS alleviated the impacts of hypoxic insulted on neuronal cells.",

    "articleAbstract": "Research into potential use of perfluorocarbons for liquid ventilation and as oxygen delivery agents in humans has been underway since the 1960s. While partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons showed promise in animal models and early human investigation, randomized controlled human trials failed to show benefit and an elevated rate of adverse events. Initial approval of Fluosol-DA (Green Cross Corporation, Japan) by the United States Food and Drug Administration as an oxygen delivery agent for use in high-risk coronary angioplasty represents the only approved application of these compounds to supplement tissue oxygenation, but the compound was rendered obsolete and removed from the market with the development of advanced angioplasty catheters in the 1990s. Second generation perfluorocarbons were developed with a higher capacity to increase the amount of oxygen dissolved in the fluid phase of blood. Early clinical trials of perflubron emulsion in non-cardiac and cardiac surgery were promising, but dose restriction and the requirement for high inspired oxygen concentration to maximize oxygen delivery for prolonged periods of time limited the clinical utility as a replacement for the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells. Identification of excess serious adverse events in treated patients resulted in discontinuation of pivotal clinical trials. Continued research investigating different formulations of perfluorocarbons have shown promise in animal studies, but continued research is necessary to prove safety and efficacy in humans.",

    "articleAbstract": "The United States federally mandated reporting of venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined by Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality Patient Safety Indicator 12 (AHRQ PSI-12), is based on administrative data, the accuracy of which has not been consistently demonstrated. We used IDEAL-X, a novel information extraction software system, to identify VTE from electronic medical records and evaluated its accuracy.Medical records for 13,248 patients admitted to an orthopedic specialty hospital from 2009 to 2014 were reviewed. Patient encounters were defined as a hospital admission where both surgery (of the spine, hip, or knee) and a radiology diagnostic study that could detect VTE was performed. Radiology reports were both manually reviewed by a physician and analyzed by IDEAL-X.Among 2083 radiology reports, IDEAL-X correctly identified 176/181 VTE events, achieving a sensitivity of 97.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 93.7%-99.1%] and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI, 98.9%-99.7%) when compared with manual review. Among 422 surgical encounters with diagnostic radiographic studies for VTE, IDEAL-X correctly identified 41 of 42 VTE events, achieving a sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI, 87.4%-99.6%) and specificity of 99.8% (95% CI, 98.7%-100.0%). The performance surpassed that of AHRQ PSI-12, which had a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% CI, 80.5%-98.4%) and specificity of 92.9% (95% CI, 89.8%-95.3%), though only the difference in specificity was statistically significant (P<0.01).IDEAL-X, a novel information extraction software system, identified VTE from radiology reports with high accuracy, with specificity surpassing AHRQ PSI-12. IDEAL-X could potentially improve detection and surveillance of many medical conditions from free text of electronic medical records.",

    "articleAbstract": "The combined comorbidity score, which merges the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices, uses the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). In October 2015, the United States adopted the 10th revision (ICD-10-CM).The objective of this study is to examine different coding algorithms for the ICD-10-CM combined comorbidity score and compare their performance to the original ICD-9-CM score.Four ICD-10-CM coding algorithms were defined: 2 using General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs), one based on ICD-10-CA (Canadian modification) codes for Charlson and Elixhauser measures, and one including codes from all 3 algorithms. We used claims data from the Clinfomatics Data Mart to identify 2 cohorts. The ICD-10-CM cohort comprised patients who had a hospitalization between January 1, 2016 and March 1, 2016. The ICD-9-CM cohort comprised patients who had a hospitalization between January 1, 2015 and March 1, 2015. We used logistic regression models to predict 30-day hospital readmission for the original score in the ICD-9-CM cohort and for each ICD-10-CM algorithm in the ICD-10-CM cohort.Distributions of each version of the score were similar. The algorithm based on ICD-10-CA codes [c-statistic, 0.646; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.640-0.653] had the most similar discrimination for readmission to the ICD-9-CM version (c, 0.646; 95% CI, 0.639-0.653), but combining all identified ICD-10-CM codes had the highest c-statistic (c, 0.651; 95% CI, 0.644-0.657).We propose an ICD-10-CM version of the combined comorbidity score that includes codes identified by ICD-10-CA and GEMs. Compared with the original score, it has similar performance in predicting readmission in a population of United States commercially insured individuals.",

    "articleAbstract": "Despite clear guidelines for its use and wide adoption, no population-based study has examined the extent to which patients with early stage breast cancer are benefiting from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by being spared a potentially avoidable axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and its associated morbidity.Examine variation in type of axillary surgery performed by surgeon volume; investigate the extent and consequences of potentially avoidable ALND.Observational study of older women with pathologically node-negative stage I-II invasive breast cancer who underwent surgery in a SEER state in 2008-2009.Surgeon annual volume of breast cancer cases and type of axillary surgery were determined by Medicare claims. An estimated probability of excess lymphedema due to ALND was calculated.Among 7686 pathologically node-negative women, 49% underwent ALND (either initially or after SLNB) and 25% were operated on by low-volume surgeons. Even after adjusting for demographic and tumor characteristics, women treated by higher volume surgeons were less likely to undergo ALND [medium volume: odds ratio, 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.82); high volume: odds ratio, 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.76)]. Potentially avoidable ALND cases were estimated to represent 21% of all expected lymphedema cases.In this pathologically node-negative population-based breast cancer cohort, only half underwent solely SLNB. Patients treated by low-volume surgeons were more likely to undergo ALND. Resources and guidelines on the appropriate training and competency of surgeons to assure the optimal performance of SLNB should be considered to decrease rates of potentially avoidable ALND and lymphedema.",

The overall 30-day readmission rate was 11.9%, of these, 22.5% occurred at a nonindex hospital. Readmissions to nonindex facilities were associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.25) and longer hospital length of stay (hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.88) in the overall sample and in the 3 cohorts.Nonindex readmissions are common and associated with worse outcomes; the common findings across cohorts highlight the importance for hospitals and care systems participating in value-based payment models.

    "articleAbstract": "It remains unclear to what extent the morbidity and mortality conference (M&M) meets the objective of improving quality and safety of patient care. It has been suggested that M&M may be too focused on individual performance, hampering system-level improvement. The aim of this study was to assess focus and sustainability of lessons for patient care that were derived from M&M.This is an observational study of routinely collected data on evaluated complications and identified lessons at surgical M&M for 8 years, assessing type and recurrence of lessons and cases from which these were drawn. Semistructured interviews with clinicians were qualitatively analyzed to explore factors contributing to lesson focus and recurrence.Three hundred eighteen lessons were drawn from 10,883 evaluated complications, primarily for those that were more severe, related to surgical or other treatment, and occurring in nonemergent, lower risk cases (all P < 0.001). Most lessons targeted intraoperative (43%) rather than preoperative or postoperative care as well as specifically technical (87%) and individual-level issues (74%). There were 43 recurring lessons (14%), mostly about postoperative care (47%) and medication management (50%). Interviewed clinicians attributed the intraoperative, technical focus primarily to greater appeal and control but identified an array of factors contributing to lesson recurrence, such as typical staff turnover in teaching hospitals.This study provided empirical evidence that learning at M&M has a tendency to focus on intraoperative, technical performance, with challenges to sustain lessons for more system-level issues. Morbidity and mortality conference formats need to anticipate these tendencies to ensure a wide focus for learning with lasting and wide impact.",

    "articleAbstract": "Polypharmacy is very common in clinical practice, especially among adult patients. The use of multiple medications may increase the risk of adverse drug events, medication cost, and medication errors. In addition, polypharmacy exacerbates treatment complexity, which consequently leads to poor patients' adherence to their medications. Despite being a well-recognized problem, few studies have investigated the prevalence and predictors of polypharmacy in Saudi Arabia.The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of polypharmacy among adult patients in a tertiary teaching hospital and to determine patients' characteristics that are associated with polypharmacy.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using data extracted from the electronic health records database for a period of 6 months between January and June 2016 in outpatient setting. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the study sample. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the association between different variables and polypharmacy. Statistical analysis software (SAS 9.2) was used to analyze the study data.A total of 17,237 observations (67.2% females) were included in the final analysis. Of these, nearly 54% (n = 9222) of reported observations were found using up to four prescription drugs and the other 46% (n = 8015) were using five or more prescription drugs. Interestingly, the prevalence of polypharmacy use was doubled among adults with hypertension as compared with those without hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.51-2.87). In addition, polypharmacy use was two times more prevalent among adults with diabetes as compared with those without diabetes (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.99-2.28) and five times more prevalent in patient with dementia (OR = 5.57, 95% CI = 1.26-24.7). Moreover, polypharmacy in adult patients was significantly influenced by sex (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.59-1.80) and nationality (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 2.00-2.31).Polypharmacy is common among adult patients especially those who are older than 60 years. Polypharmacy may affect the overall process of drug therapy. It can be a risk factor to develop undesirable adverse drug events, especially in those with chronic health conditions. A special care should be taken to manage polypharmacy among adults in Saudi Arabia.",

    "articleAbstract": "Teamwork training improves short-term teamwork behaviors. However, improvements are often not sustained.The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which teamwork reinforcement activities for orthopedic surgery teams lead to sustained teamwork behaviors.Seven months after 104 staff from an orthopedic surgical unit were trained in Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety principles, 4 reinforcement activities were implemented regarding leadership and communication: lectures with videos on leadership skills for nursing staff; an online self-paced learning program on communication skills for nursing staff; a 1-page summary on leadership skills e-mailed to surgical staff; and a 1-hour perioperative grand rounds on Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety principles for anesthesia staff and new staff. Twenty-four orthopedic surgical teams were evaluated on teamwork behaviors during surgery by 2 observers before and after the reinforcement period using the Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery tool.After reinforcement, leadership (P = 0.022) and communication (P = 0.044) behaviors improved compared with prereinforcement levels. Specifically, nursing staff improved in leadership (P = 0.016) and communication (P = 0.028) behaviors, surgical staff improved in leadership behaviors (P = 0.009), but anesthesia staff did not improve in any teamwork behaviors.Sustained improvement in teamwork behaviors requires reinforcement.Level III, prospective pre-post cohort study.",

    "articleAbstract": "New direct antiviral agents (DAA) for HCV treatment result in sustained viral response (SVR) in most patients. However, predicting the point of no-return is still an unmet need for those with advanced liver disease.to assess if baseline liver volume is a predictor of post-SVR liver function.Cirrhotic patients assessed for liver transplantation (LT) and consecutively treated with DAA between September 2014 and 2015 who achieved an SVR were included. Pretreatment liver (LV) and spleen (SV) volumes adjusted by Body Surface Area (BSA) were calculated from CT/MR images. Liver function was assessed by Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and MELD scores and a multivariate mixed regression model was used to identify baseline factors associated with improvement of liver function overtime.We included 42 patients with a median age of 58.6 years (Q1-Q3: 52.7 - 68.8); MELD, 14 (11-17); CTP, 9 (8-10); LV, 1400.9 mL (1183.2-1601.4); SV, 782.9 mL (490.6-1118.8). MELD scores at baseline and at last control were 14 (11-17) and 10 (8-12), respectively (p<0.001); CTP scores were 9 (8-10) and 6 (5-7), respectively (p<0.001). In the multivariate model, higher LV/BSA was associated with an improvement of MELD and CTP over time (p=0.03 and p=0.044, respectively).LV is a noninvasive tool that can predict functional improvement in cirrhotic patients undergoing DAA therapies.",

    "articleAbstract": "There is evidence of brain recovery on brain MRI early postliver transplant(LT) but the longer-term impact is unclear. Aim of this study was to determine the change in brain MRI parameters, cognition and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between 6 and 12 months post-LT.Listed cirrhotics underwent cognitive, HRQOL and brain MRI pre, 6 months (post-LT1) and 1-year (post-LT2) post-LT. Assessment of MRI changes between visits was performed for ammonia-associated metabolite changes using spectroscopy (MRS), white matter changes using Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data and grey matter changes using Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis on 3D high resolution T1-weighted images.Forty-five patients were included of which, twenty-three were tested at all visits. Cognitive and HRQOL scores improved between all visits compared to pre-LT values. This trend continued on MRS with reduced glutamine+glutamate(Glx) and higher myoinositol(mI), Choline(Cho) between pre-LT/post-LT1 but lower degrees of improvement between post-LT1/post-LT2. On DTI, mean-diffusivity(MD), linear-diffusivity(LD) and mode of anisotropy(MO) continued to increase in the posterior internal capsule at both post-LT visits. On VBM, a continued increase was seen in basal ganglia grey matter between both post-LT visits was seen.HRQOL and cognition continue to improve compared to pre-LT values up to 1 year post-LT, although the rate of improvement slows down after 6 months. Grey matter increase is steady over time at 1 year although changes in ammonia-related metabolites and white matter integrity improve at a slower pace at 1 year post-LT.",

Although secondary HLH is reported to occur in association with various malignancies, there is no report of its association with thyroid cancer. We evaluated a 19-year-old man who presented with HLH. During investigation for an underlying cause of his HLH computed tomographic scan of the neck discovered thyroid nodules that were confirmed with biopsy to be papillary thyroid carcinoma. He was treated with surgery followed by radioactive iodine therapy and remains without any recurrence of malignancy or his secondary HLH. This report documents the first observation of HLH associated with thyroid cancer, and illustrates the need to include imaging of the neck while evaluating patients with secondary HLH for an underlying malignancy.",

    "articleAbstract": "Traditional socket prostheses are not a viable option for all lower-limb prosthetic users. Discomfort, pain in the residual limb, and problems related to the fit of the socket are common and have been shown to negatively impact quality of life and mobility. Osseointegrated or bone-anchored prosthetic implants have evolved over the past 2 decades as a promising alternative for patients who are experiencing substantial issues with socket prostheses.A review of the literature was performed to identify studies focusing on the evolution, clinical outcomes, success rates, and complications of osseointegrated lower-limb prostheses. Articles were summarized according to the implant type, amputation level, and study characteristics, with rating of the Level of Evidence. Information on patient selection criteria, outcomes, and complications was extracted.Fourteen articles (with Level-II, III, or IV evidence) met the inclusion criteria. Infection and soft-tissue irritation at the stoma were the most common complications. It is evident that, over the years, changes in implant design, surgical technique, perioperative and postoperative care, and rehabilitation protocols have resulted in improvements in functional outcomes and health-related quality of life, and reduction in rates of complications.Osseointegration for limb amputation has become an established clinical treatment option for persons with lower-limb amputation not tolerating traditional socket prostheses. Osseointegration could provide substantial benefits regarding function and quality of life for appropriately selected patients who accept the documented risks.Therapeutic Level IV.

    "articleAbstract": "The mistreatment of learners is an ongoing issue at U.S. medical schools. According to responses to the 2017 Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire, 39.3% of medical students nationally reported being mistreated. Many articles have been published on the topic of mistreatment at medical schools over the last 20 years. These articles have focused primarily on the definition of mistreatment, the impact of mistreatment, and initiatives put into place to help mitigate the problem. To date, very little attention has been paid to repairing the harm caused by mistreatment and rebuilding community trust. Academic medicine is in need of new forums of interaction to achieve more positive learning and workplace environments.The authors discuss restorative justice practices and the potential applications that they may have in academic medicine learning and workplace environments to serve vulnerable students, faculty, and staff who are targets of mistreatment. Restorative justice practices are used to convene groups of people to engage in substantive dialogue about consequential issues that impede community functioning. This process can help a group identify and gain mutual understanding of the personal and collective harm that has occurred, create the conditions that incentivize offenders to admit responsibility rather than deny or minimize the harm, and explore and define a set of problem-solving steps to address the harm and rebuild community trust.",

    "articleAbstract": "Accomplishing mechanically robust omniphobic surfaces is a long-existing challenge, and can potentially find applications in bioengineering, tribology and paint industries. Slippery liquid impregnated mesoporous α-Al2O3 interfaces are achieved with water, alkanes, water based and oil based high viscosity acrylic paints. Incredibly high abrasion-resistance (wear coefficients ≤ 10-8 mm3.N-1.m-1) and ultra-low friction coefficients (≤ 0.025) are attained, attributing to the hard alumina matrix and continuous replenishment of perfluoropolyether aided by capillarity and surface diffusion processes. A variety of impregnating liquids employed suggest that large molecules, faster surface diffusion and lowest evaporation rate generate the rare combination of high wear-resistance and omniphobicity. It is noteworthy that these novel interfaces exhibit outstanding load bearing capacity up to 350 MPa; 3 orders of magnitude higher than achievable by the state of the art omniphobic surfaces. Further, our developed thermodynamic calculations suggest that the relative thermodynamic stability of liquid impregnated composites is linearly proportional to the spreading coefficient (S) of the impregnating liquid with the matrix material and is an important tool for the selection of an appropriate matrix material.",

    "articleAbstract": "The conventional application of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients consists merely in the acquisition of ICP values in discrete time and their comparison to the established ICP threshold. An exceeding of this threshold triggers a special emergency treatment protocol. This paper addresses the possibility of making use of the rich information latent in the ICP records of known vital and fatal outcomes gathered during real clinical practice of treating TBI patients. Our assumption was that the proposed algorithmic procedure derived from this information could, in addition to ICP monitoring itself, provide a complementary added value. This might help clinicians to make better decisions during a patient's treatment.We concentrated on studying specific clustering schemes for subsequences of ICP time series. The clusterization problem was formulated for feature vectors which are introduced to represent ICP time subsequences. The ICP transformation to a feature space uses global and local definitions of time subsequences. For clusterization itself, we adopted hierarchical Gaussian mixture models (hGMMs). By using posterior probabilities of the clusters, we introduced three novel alarm functions. We explored two alternative methods of searching for optimum alarm function thresholds (ROC analysis and a novel efficiency measure).We performed extensive cross-validation experiments on a clinical retrospective data set. The results of the optimization over several hGMMs, various feature space dimensionality and all the types of the novel alarm functions show the potential of the novel alarm functions for supplementing conventional ICP monitoring.In conclusion, the paper provides a prospective extended ICP monitoring technique for real TBI patients, based on the proposed methodology of ICP subsequence clustering and thresholding of the optimum novel alarm function.",

    "articleAbstract": "This paper aims to report on the accuracy of estimating sleep stages using a wrist-worn device that measures movement using a 3D accelerometer and an optical pulse photoplethysmograph (PPG).Overnight recordings were obtained from 60 adult participants wearing these devices on their left and right wrist, simultaneously with a Type III home sleep testing device (Embletta MPR) which included EEG channels for sleep staging. The 60 participants were self-reported normal sleepers (36 M: 24 F, age  =  34  ±  10, BMI  =  28  ±  6). The Embletta recordings were scored for sleep stages using AASM guidelines and were used to develop and validate an automated sleep stage estimation algorithm, which labeled sleep stages as one of Wake, Light (N1 or N2), Deep (N3) and REM (REM). Features were extracted from the accelerometer and PPG sensors, which reflected movement, breathing and heart rate variability.Based on leave-one-out validation, the overall per-epoch accuracy of the automated algorithm was 69%, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.52  ±  0.14. There was no observable bias to under- or over-estimate wake, light, or deep sleep durations. REM sleep duration was slightly over-estimated by the system. The most common misclassifications were light/REM and light/wake mislabeling.The results indicate that a reasonable degree of sleep staging accuracy can be achieved using a wrist-worn device, which may be of utility in longitudinal studies of sleep habits.",

    "articleAbstract": "Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of nanowires are often carried out on broken-off nanowires in order to avoid the ensemble effects as well as substrate contribution. However, the development of nanowire-array solar cells could benefit from non-destructive optical characterization to allow faster feedback and further device processing. With this work, we show that different nanowire array and substrate spectral behaviors with delay time and excitation power can be used to determine which part of the sample dominates the detected spectrum. Here, we evaluate TRPL characterization of dense periodic as-grown GaAs nanowire arrays on a p-type GaAs substrate, including a sample with uncapped GaAs nanowires and several samples passivated with AlGaAs radial shell of varied composition and thickness. We observe a strong spectral overlap of substrate and nanowire signals and find that the nanowires can absorb part of the substrate luminescence signal, thus resulting in a modified substrate signal. The level of absorption depends on the nanowire-array geometry, making a deconvolution of the nanowire signal very difficult. By studying TRPL of substrate-only and as-grown nanowires at 770 nm and 400 nm excitation wavelengths, we find a difference in spectral behavior with delay time and excitation power that can be used to assess whether the signal is dominated by the nanowires. We find that the nanowire signal dominates with 400 nm excitation wavelength, where we observe two different types of excitation power dependence for the nanowires capped with high and low Al composition shells. Finally, from the excitation power dependence of the peak TRPL signal, we extract an estimate of background carrier concentration in the nanowires.",

Family history revealed unexplained death in three brothers of the patient's mother during infancy. Molecular analysis of the DAX-1 gene revealed the presence of a novel hemizygous mutation, c.870C>A in exon 1, leading to the formation of a premature stop codon. The same mutation was identified in the patient's mother. The truncated mutant protein is most likely misfolded, sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore cannot bind to and activate its target DNA sequences in the nucleus.DAX-1 mutation must be considered when diagnosis of primary adrenocortical insufficiency is made, especially if there is a history of unexplained death of maternal male relatives.",

    "articleAbstract": "Background Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) during the perimenopausal period and in menopause have been linked to altered bone mass density (BMD) in various experimental studies. However, current clinical studies provide conflicting results in this field. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate this association. Materials and methods We conducted a prospective case control study that was based on a consecutive series of menopausal women who attended the Reproductive Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of our hospital between January 2013 and December 2016. Results One hundred and forty post-menopausal women were included in the present study. After stratifying the women in two groups according to the presence of MetS we observed that bone turnover markers remained unaffected by the presence of MetS (p > 0.05). On the other hand, both the T- and Z-scores of women with MetS were significantly higher compared to healthly postmenopausal women [T-score: 0.4 (-0.7 to 1.3) vs. -1 (-1.62 to -0.1), p < 0.001] [Z-score: 0.55 (-0.3 to 1.7) vs. -0.4 (-1.1 to 0.4), p = 0.003]. Conclusions According to the findings of our study the presence of MetS during the perimenopausal years seems to have a mild benefit on bone mass density. The pathophysiology that underlies this effect remains unclear as bone turnover markers seem to be unaffected by MetS.",

    "articleAbstract": "Obesity is associated with the risk of several health disorders including certain cancers. Among obesity-related cancers, postmenopausal breast carcinoma is a well-studied one. Apart from an increase in certain types of lipids in obesity, excess adipose tissue releases many hormone-like cytokines/adipokines, which are usually pro-inflammatory in nature. Leptin is one of such adipokines and significantly linked with the intracellular signaling pathways of other growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In general, HER2 is overexpressed in roughly 30% of breast carcinomas; its presence indicates aggressive tumor behavior. Conversely, HER2 has certain effects in normal conditions such as differentiation of preadipocytes, cardiovascular health and vitamin D metabolism. HER2 has no known endogenous ligand, but it may form dimers with other three members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and can activate downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, HER2 is intimately connected with several enzymes, e.g. fatty acid synthase (FASN), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), all of which play significant regulatory roles in lipogenic pathways or lipid metabolism. In obesity-related carcinogenesis, characteristics like insulin resistance and elevated IGF-1 are commonly observed. Both IGF-1 and leptin can modulate EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways. Although clinical studies have shown mixed results, the behavior of HER2+ tumor cells including HER2 levels can be altered by several factors such as obesity, leptin and fatty acids. A precise knowledge is useful in new therapeutic approaches against HER+ tumors.",

    "articleAbstract": "The determination of κ free light chains (KFLC) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by nephelometry is a feasible alternative to immunoglobulin G oligoclonal bands (OCB) in the evaluation of intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of KFLC and its inclusion in a procedure algorithm along with OCB interpretation.A cross-sectional study, which included 123 patients with a CSF OCB request, was carried out. Isoelectric focusing followed by immunofixation was used to detect OCB, and nephelometry was used to analyze KFLC. The KFLC index was calculated using CSF/serum quotient of KFLC and albumin. The KFLC index was compared with MS diagnosis to find the optimal cutoff. It was obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden method.The CSF KFLC median was 1.66 mg/L in the MS group, whereas in other central nervous system diseases, KFLC showed generally no or only moderate increase in CSF (median 0.10 mg/L). KFLC index showed a significant difference between groups. ROC analysis for CSF KFLC concentration, and KFLC indexes were 91.88% and 93.94%, respectively. The best cutoff for the KFLC index was 2.91 for MS diagnosis (sensitivity: 83.78%; specificity: 85.88%). The proposed algorithm showed high sensitivity (89.19%) and specificity (84.71%).KFLC determination is rapid and automatized, but it has no higher sensitivity and specificity than OCB in MS diagnosis. Nevertheless, when used in screening, it could reduce the number of manual OCB tests.",

    "articleAbstract": "Today's landscape of medical devices is dominated by stand-alone systems and proprietary interfaces lacking cross-vendor interoperability. This complicates or even impedes the innovation of novel, intelligent assistance systems relying on the collaboration of medical devices. Emerging approaches use the service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm based on Internet protocol (IP) to enable communication between medical devices. While this works well for scenarios with no or only soft timing constraints, the underlying best-effort communication scheme is insufficient for time critical data. Real-time (RT) networks are able to reliably guarantee fixed latency boundaries, for example, by using time division multiple access (TDMA) communication patterns. However, deterministic RT networks come with their own limitations such as tedious, inflexible configuration and a more restricted bandwidth allocation. In this contribution we overcome the drawbacks of both approaches by describing and implementing mechanisms that allow the two networks to interact. We introduce the first implementation of a medical device network that offers hard RT guarantees for control and sensor data and integrates into SOA networks. Based on two application examples we show how the flexibility of SOA networks and the reliability of RT networks can be combined to achieve an open network infrastructure for medical devices in the operating room (OR).",

Computer-based analyses of wheeze signals have been extensively used for parametric analysis, spectral analysis, identification of airway obstruction, feature extraction and diseases or pathology classification. While this area is currently an active field of research, the available literature has not yet been reviewed. This systematic review identified articles describing wheeze analyses using computer-based techniques on the SCOPUS, IEEE Xplore, ACM, PubMed and Springer and Elsevier electronic databases. After a set of selection criteria was applied, 41 articles were selected for detailed analysis. The findings reveal that 1) computerized wheeze analysis can be used for the identification of disease severity level or pathology, 2) further research is required to achieve acceptable rates of identification on the degree of airway obstruction with normal breathing, 3) analysis using combinations of features and on subgroups of the respiratory cycle has provided a pathway to classify various diseases or pathology that stem from airway obstruction.",

For the efficient design of the accelerometer as a fully implantable biomedical device, the design parameters such as size, weight and resonant frequency have been considered. The geometrical parameters are varied to obtain the optimum sensitivity considering the design constraints and the stability of the structure. The optimised design is simulated and verified using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS 4.2. The stability of the device is ensured using eigenfrequency analysis. Optimised results of the device geometry are presented and discussed. The accelerometer has a sensing area of 1 mm2 and attains a nominal capacitance of 5.3 pF and an optimum sensitivity of 6.89 fF.",

    "articleAbstract": "More than 330 million people are still living in extreme poverty in Africa. Timely, accurate, and spatially fine-grained baseline data are essential to determining policy in favor of reducing poverty. The potential of \"Big Data\" to estimate socioeconomic factors in Africa has been proven. However, most current studies are limited to using a single data source. We propose a computational framework to accurately predict the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at a finest spatial granularity and coverage of 552 communes in Senegal using environmental data (related to food security, economic activity, and accessibility to facilities) and call data records (capturing individualistic, spatial, and temporal aspects of people). Our framework is based on Gaussian Process regression, a Bayesian learning technique, providing uncertainty associated with predictions. We perform model selection using elastic net regularization to prevent overfitting. Our results empirically prove the superior accuracy when using disparate data (Pearson correlation of 0.91). Our approach is used to accurately predict important dimensions of poverty: health, education, and standard of living (Pearson correlation of 0.84-0.86). All predictions are validated using deprivations calculated from census. Our approach can be used to generate poverty maps frequently, and its diagnostic nature is, likely, to assist policy makers in designing better interventions for poverty eradication.",

    "articleAbstract": "Inside the cell nucleus, genomes fold into organized structures that are characteristic of cell type. Here, we show that this chromatin architecture can be predicted de novo using epigenetic data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We exploit the idea that chromosomes encode a 1D sequence of chromatin structural types. Interactions between these chromatin types determine the 3D structural ensemble of chromosomes through a process similar to phase separation. First, a neural network is used to infer the relation between the epigenetic marks present at a locus, as assayed by ChIP-Seq, and the genomic compartment in which those loci reside, as measured by DNA-DNA proximity ligation (Hi-C). Next, types inferred from this neural network are used as an input to an energy landscape model for chromatin organization [Minimal Chromatin Model (MiChroM)] to generate an ensemble of 3D chromosome conformations at a resolution of 50 kilobases (kb). After training the model, dubbed Maximum Entropy Genomic Annotation from Biomarkers Associated to Structural Ensembles (MEGABASE), on odd-numbered chromosomes, we predict the sequences of chromatin types and the subsequent 3D conformational ensembles for the even chromosomes. We validate these structural ensembles by using ChIP-Seq tracks alone to predict Hi-C maps, as well as distances measured using 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. Both sets of experiments support the hypothesis of phase separation being the driving process behind compartmentalization. These findings strongly suggest that epigenetic marking patterns encode sufficient information to determine the global architecture of chromosomes and that de novo structure prediction for whole genomes may be increasingly possible.",

    "articleAbstract": "Although evolution by natural selection is widely regarded as the most important principle of biology, it is unknown whether phenotypic variations within and between species are mostly adaptive or neutral due to the lack of relevant studies of large, unbiased samples of phenotypic traits. Here, we examine 210 yeast morphological traits chosen because of experimental feasibility irrespective of their potential adaptive values. Our analysis is based on the premise that, under neutrality, the rate of phenotypic evolution measured in the unit of mutational size declines as the trait becomes more important to fitness, analogous to the neutral paradigm that functional genes evolve more slowly than functionless pseudogenes. However, we find faster evolution of more important morphological traits within and between species, rejecting the neutral hypothesis. By contrast, an analysis of 3,466 gene expression traits fails to refute neutrality. Thus, at least in yeast, morphological evolution appears largely adaptive, but the same may not apply to other classes of phenotypes. Our neutrality test is applicable to other species, especially genetic model organisms, for which estimations of mutational size and trait importance are relatively straightforward.",

    "articleAbstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, the sex pheromone produced by males, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), evokes a stereotypic gender-specific behavior in both males and females. As Drosophila adults feed, mate, and oviposit on food, they perceive the pheromone as a blend against a background of food odors. Previous studies have reported that food odors enhance flies' behavioral response to cVA, specifically in virgin females. However, how and where the different olfactory inputs interact has so far remained unknown. In this study, we elucidated the neuronal mechanism underlying the response at an anatomical, functional, and behavioral level. Our data show that in virgin females cVA and the complex food odor vinegar evoke a synergistic response in the cVA-responsive glomerulus DA1. This synergism, however, does not appear at the input level of the glomerulus, but is restricted to the projection neuron level only. Notably, it is abolished by a mutation in gap junctions in projection neurons and is found to be mediated by electrical synapses between excitatory local interneurons and projection neurons. As a behavioral consequence, we demonstrate that virgin females in the presence of vinegar become receptive more rapidly to courting males, while male courtship is not affected. Altogether, our results suggest that lateral excitation via gap junctions modulates odor tuning in the antennal lobe and drives synergistic interactions between two ecologically relevant odors, representing food and sex.",

While existing approaches are powerful, none allow quantitative library-on-library characterization of protein interactions in a modifiable extracellular environment. Here, we show that sexual agglutination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be reprogrammed to link interaction strength with mating efficiency using synthetic agglutination (SynAg). Validation of SynAg with 89 previously characterized interactions shows a log-linear relationship between mating efficiency and protein binding strength for interactions with Kds ranging from below 500 pM to above 300 μM. Using induced chromosomal translocation to pair barcodes representing binding proteins, thousands of distinct interactions can be screened in a single pot. We demonstrate the ability to characterize protein interaction networks in a modifiable environment by introducing a soluble peptide that selectively disrupts a subset of interactions in a representative network by up to 800-fold. SynAg enables the high-throughput, quantitative characterization of protein-protein interaction networks in a fully defined extracellular environment at a library-on-library scale.",

    "articleAbstract": "Ischemic injury represents the most frequent cause of death and disability, and it remains unclear why, of all body organs, the brain is most sensitive to hypoxia. In many tissues, type 4 NADPH oxidase is induced upon ischemia or hypoxia, converting oxygen to reactive oxygen species. Here, we show in mouse models of ischemia in the heart, brain, and hindlimb that only in the brain does NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) lead to ischemic damage. We explain this distinct cellular distribution pattern through cell-specific knockouts. Endothelial NOX4 breaks down the BBB, while neuronal NOX4 leads to neuronal autotoxicity. Vascular smooth muscle NOX4, the common denominator of ischemia within all ischemic organs, played no apparent role. The direct neuroprotective potential of pharmacological NOX4 inhibition was confirmed in an ex vivo model, free of vascular and BBB components. Our results demonstrate that the heightened sensitivity of the brain to ischemic damage is due to an organ-specific role of NOX4 in blood-brain-barrier endothelial cells and neurons. This mechanism is conserved in at least two rodents and humans, making NOX4 a prime target for a first-in-class mechanism-based, cytoprotective therapy in the unmet high medical need indication of ischemic stroke.",

    "articleAbstract": "Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.",

    "articleAbstract": "Protected areas buffer species from anthropogenic threats and provide places for the processes that generate and maintain biodiversity to continue. However, genetic variation, the raw material for evolution, is difficult to capture in conservation planning, not least because genetic data require considerable resources to obtain and analyze. Here we show that freely available environmental and geographic distance variables can be highly effective surrogates in conservation planning for representing adaptive and neutral intraspecific genetic variation. We obtained occurrence and genetic data from the IntraBioDiv project for 27 plant species collected over the European Alps using a gridded sampling scheme. For each species, we identified loci that were potentially under selection using outlier loci methods, and mapped their main gradients of adaptive and neutral genetic variation across the grid cells. We then used the cells as planning units to prioritize protected area acquisitions. First, we verified that the spatial patterns of environmental and geographic variation were correlated, respectively, with adaptive and neutral genetic variation. Second, we showed that these surrogates can predict the proportion of genetic variation secured in randomly generated solutions. Finally, we discovered that solutions based only on surrogate information secured substantial amounts of adaptive and neutral genetic variation. Our work paves the way for widespread integration of surrogates for genetic variation into conservation planning.",

    "articleAbstract": "The low-frequency vibrational and low-temperature thermal properties of amorphous solids are markedly different from those of crystalline solids. This situation is counterintuitive because all solid materials are expected to behave as a homogeneous elastic body in the continuum limit, in which vibrational modes are phonons that follow the Debye law. A number of phenomenological explanations for this situation have been proposed, which assume elastic heterogeneities, soft localized vibrations, and so on. Microscopic mean-field theories have recently been developed to predict the universal non-Debye scaling law. Considering these theoretical arguments, it is absolutely necessary to directly observe the nature of the low-frequency vibrations of amorphous solids and determine the laws that such vibrations obey. Herein, we perform an extremely large-scale vibrational mode analysis of a model amorphous solid. We find that the scaling law predicted by the mean-field theory is violated at low frequency, and in the continuum limit, the vibrational modes converge to a mixture of phonon modes that follow the Debye law and soft localized modes that follow another universal non-Debye scaling law.",

What contribution melanopsin makes to conscious visual perception is less studied. We devised a stimulus that targeted melanopsin separately from the cones using pulsed (3-s) spectral modulations around a photopic background. Pupillometry confirmed that the melanopsin stimulus evokes a response different from that produced by cone stimulation. In each of four subjects, a functional MRI response in area V1 was found. This response scaled with melanopic contrast and was not easily explained by imprecision in the silencing of the cones. Twenty additional subjects then observed melanopsin pulses and provided a structured rating of the perceptual experience. Melanopsin stimulation was described as an unpleasant, blurry, minimal brightening that quickly faded. We conclude that isolated stimulation of melanopsin is likely associated with a response within the cortical visual pathway and with an evoked conscious percept.",

    "articleAbstract": "Salamanders exhibit extensive regenerative capacities and serve as a unique model in regeneration research. However, due to the lack of targeted gene knockin approaches, it has been difficult to label and manipulate some of the cell populations that are crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying regeneration. Here we have established highly efficient gene knockin approaches in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Using a homology-independent method, we successfully inserted both the Cherry reporter gene and a larger membrane-tagged Cherry-ER(T2)-Cre-ER(T2) (∼5-kb) cassette into axolotl Sox2 and Pax7 genomic loci. Depending on the size of the DNA fragments for integration, 5-15% of the F0 transgenic axolotl are positive for the transgene. Using these techniques, we have labeled and traced the PAX7-positive satellite cells as a major source contributing to myogenesis during axolotl limb regeneration. Our work brings a key genetic tool to molecular and cellular studies of axolotl regeneration.",

    "articleAbstract": "Fetal infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) can lead to congenital Zika virus syndrome (cZVS), which includes cortical malformations and microcephaly. The aspects of cortical development that are affected during virus infection are unknown. Using organotypic brain slice cultures generated from embryonic mice of various ages, sites of ZIKV replication including the neocortical proliferative zone and radial columns, as well as the developing midbrain, were identified. The infected radial units are surrounded by uninfected cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that programmed cell death may limit viral dissemination in the brain and may constrain virus-associated injury. Therefore, a critical aspect of ZIKV-induced neuropathology may be defined by death of uninfected cells. All ZIKV isolates assayed replicated efficiently in early and midgestation cultures, and two isolates examined replicated in late-gestation tissue. Alteration of neocortical cytoarchitecture, such as disruption of the highly elongated basal processes of the radial glial progenitor cells and impairment of postmitotic neuronal migration, were also observed. These data suggest that all lineages of ZIKV tested are neurotropic, and that ZIKV infection interferes with multiple aspects of neurodevelopment that contribute to the complexity of cZVS.",

    "articleAbstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus initially endemic to Central and East Africa but now spreading to Asia, Europe, and most recently the Western hemisphere. CHIKV infection initially presents as an acute, nonspecific febrile syndrome with rash and polyarthralgia, later leading to a chronic arthritis clinically similar to rheumatoid arthritis. We report a case of an active duty military member infected with CHIKV while deployed to Central America, who developed chronic arthritis. Active duty military members are at higher risk of contracting CHIKV because of deployment to countries with a high prevalence of this mosquito-borne illness. Severe chronic arthritis can result from CHIKV, resulting in serious impact on fitness for military duty.",

    "articleAbstract": "For veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), symptomatic control often requires multiple psychotropic agents. We describe a case in which a young veteran experienced recurrent priapism while receiving treatment for PTSD with several medications, most notably trazodone and prazosin.Our patient presented to the emergency department with priapism, approximately 3 months after beginning a pharmacologic regimen of escitalopram, prazosin, trazodone, and methylphenidate for PTSD. Detumescence was achieved, and he was instructed to discontinue trazodone. Approximately 1 month after discontinuation, he presented to the emergency department with recurrent priapism. Our patient had no obvious risk factors, including sickle cell disease, cocaine use, or utilization of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. After his second episode, our patient discontinued prazosin, and after 6 weeks had not experienced recurrence.Food and Drug Administration-approved medications alone are often inadequate to treat-specific symptoms, especially those related to sleep. Consequently, trazodone and prazosin are frequently used off-label. Although priapism has been associated with these medications, there are currently no data available regarding the incidence of priapism related to dose or combination with other agents. Combat veterans may represent a population at higher risk for priapism given their often complex psychotropic regimens.",

Despite a drastic decline in kappa light chains following chemotherapy; his renal function worsened, and he progressed to end-stage renal disease, requiring hemodialysis. Light-chain-mediated acute tubular interstitial nephritis is an uncommon type of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance presenting with acute renal failure without significant glomerular disease. Our case illustrates that light-chain-mediated acute tubular interstitial nephritis may present clinically like acute interstitial nephritis and that renal biopsy is critical for diagnosis. We also explore possible links between various environmental and occupational exposures that could have precipitated his disease process at such a young age.",

    "articleAbstract": "Stress fractures of the femoral neck are career-threatening and life-altering injuries that occur frequently in Initial Entry Training (IET) Soldiers. Because of the severity of these injuries, military clinics that serve IET Soldiers have implemented guidelines to direct providers in the management of Soldiers with signs of symptoms of stress fracture. These guidelines focus on Soldiers presenting with a primary complaint of hip pain. The cases described here show two Soldiers who had displaced hip fractures despite having primary complaints of knee pain and no self-reported hip pain. In the first case, the patient was ambulatory with a slight limp and lateral knee pain that he rated as 3 out of 10. His physical therapist noted a significant gross leg length discrepancy on physical examination. Leg length X-rays identified a displaced fracture of the femoral neck. In the second case, the Soldier had severe (7/10) lateral knee pain with no complaints of hip pain. He presented to the Emergency Department where he received knee X-rays, which were normal. The next day in physical therapy, he continued to complain of severe knee pain. A femur X-ray demonstrated that he had a displaced hip fracture. Throughout their examination and diagnostic workup, neither of these patients ever experienced any hip pain. The implication of these cases is that clinicians must remain vigilant in examining the joints above and below the primary complaint. This may be more important when evaluating trainees who have a uniquely high risk of severe bone stress injury. Clinicians who work primarily with trainees should consider updating clinical management guidelines to include basic hip screening on patients who present with primary complaints of knee pain. Because of cases like these and the known connection between knee pain and hip pathology, we recommend that clinicians in IET clinics consider screening procedures to rule out hip pathology in trainees with primary complaints of knee pain.",

    "articleAbstract": "The use of dietary supplements (DSs) is widespread in the military. Service members use DS for any number of reasons, to include supporting general health, increasing energy levels, enhancing performance, and promoting gains in strength. However, some readily available DS products are potentially unsafe. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the ability of military medical students to use the Operation Supplement Safety DS risk assessment tool. The Operation Supplement Safety risk assessment tool was developed to assist Service members in making decisions about safe DS use.Fourth-year medical students used an online assessment tool to risk stratify and evaluate the safety of 12 predesignated DS. The assessment tool consists of seven polar questions (yes/no), with an answer of \"yes\" given a score of 1 and an answer of \"no\" given a score of 0. Students recorded responses to each of the seven questions for each of the 12 DSs. The tool then generated a total score for each DS, which was compared to the previously identified correct total score. Students' scores for each individual yes/no question and final conclusion about DS safety were also assessed.Forty responses for the 12 DSs were examined. Five supplements were expected to receive a score of ≥4, suggesting they were likely safe. The average scores (± standard deviation [SD]) for each DS vs. the correct safety score were fish oil (5.9 ± 1.4 vs. 7.0), iron (4.2 ± 1.4 vs. 4.0), melatonin (4.9 ± 0.8 vs. 5.0), multivitamin/mineral (3.8 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0), multivitamin/mineral for men (4.0 ± 1.0 vs. 5.0), performance-enhancing supplement A (1.5 ± 1.1 vs. 2.0), performance-enhancing supplement B (2.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.0), performance-enhancing supplement C (0.6 ± 0.5 vs. 1.0), performance-enhancing supplement D (1.8 ± 1.0 vs. 3.0), performance-enhancing supplement E (1.5 ± 1.3 vs. 1.0), sexual enhancement supplement (1.3 ± 0.7 vs. 1.0), and weight loss supplement (1.1 ± 1.1 vs. 1.0).The DS risk assessment tool provides consumers a quick way to screen DS for safety and can help consumers make more informed decisions when purchasing DS. Scores had minimal intersubject variability and were comparable to expected risk stratification. Our results suggest the assessment tool may be appropriate for medical students to use when investigating the safety of DS. We recommend additional research to verify whether the findings from this study would be similar for other potential users, as well as assess other psychometric properties.",

    "articleAbstract": "Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common disorder among women. This is particularly bothersome to physically active women, such as those who serve in the Armed Forces. With the documented success of the midurethral sling (MUS) in the treatment of SUI, more women are electing to undergo surgical treatment. Studies document that women have less inhibition about exercise as a result of decreased incontinence following MUS surgery. We sought to determine if MUS surgery is associated with a change in weight postoperatively resulting from increased levels of activity following surgery. We hypothesized that women, particularly active duty (AD) women, would experience a decrease in weight and body mass index (BMI) in the year following the MUS procedure.This retrospective cohort study used the military electronic medical record system. The subjects included AD military and civilian (CV) patients who underwent MUS surgery at tertiary care centers between July 2006 and March 2013. Weight and BMI were recorded for three distinct time periods: 1-year preoperatively, at time of surgery, and 1-year postoperatively.A total of 207 women met inclusion criteria, 76 of which were AD women in the U.S. military. For the group as a whole, we found no significant difference in mean weight or BMI among the three time points examined; however, decreases in BMI and weight were noted in the year following surgery for the subgroups of AD and obese women. Analysis of covariance showed that age, parity, preoperative weight, and concomitant hysterectomy were not significant determinants for change in weight postoperatively.Despite its effective treatment of SUI, MUS surgery did not significantly affect the weight of patients postoperatively in our retrospective cohort.",

    "articleAbstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has taken a disproportionate toll on the lives of African Americans, and many previous studies suggest HIV conspiracy beliefs and physician mistrust play important roles in this racial disparity. Because many HIV conspiracy theories tie government involvement with the origin and potential cure for HIV, an area for further examination is HIV+ African American veterans in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care. In addition to HIV conspiracy beliefs, veterans may already be mistrustful of the VHA as a government healthcare provider. This mistrust is significantly associated with poor health outcomes, among both minority and nonminority persons living with HIV.We conducted interviews with 32 African American veterans at three VHA hospitals to assess HIV conspiracy beliefs and mistrust in physicians providing HIV care. A semistructured interview format allowed respondents to talk freely about their personal history with HIV, their perceptions about living with HIV, and their views on HIV conspiracy beliefs.Five major themes arose from these interviews, including that the government uses HIV to control minority populations; the Veterans Affairs healthcare providers may play a role in withholding HIV treatment, and many HIV-infected veterans are suspicious of HIV treatment regimens. Additionally, several HIV-infected veterans in our study disclosed that they did not follow the prescribed treatment recommendations to ensure adherence.A veteran's beliefs drive views of the healthcare system and trust of HIV-infected veterans' healthcare providers, and impact HIV-infected veterans' willingness to accept treatment for their medical conditions. Further research should continue to examine the impact of mistrust and endorsement of conspiracy beliefs among veterans receiving care in VHA.",

Thereafter, rates returned to prevaccine levels. Rates dropped after reintroduction of an Ad4/7 vaccine in 2011.Surfaces of the barracks and medical clinic of a training camp were swabbed in 3 studies in 2004 and 1 study in 2007, and tested with culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Similar swabbing was done in 2013 and 2015 and tested with PCR.In the studies before 2011 (prevaccine), 12% of samples were Ad4/7 positive by culture and 27% positive by PCR. In the 2 studies after 2011 (postvaccine), no samples were Ad4/7 positive.The Ad 4/7 vaccine has resulted in the near elimination of Ad4/7-related disease and the disappearance of Ad4/7 from surfaces in a military basic training camp. Renewed transmission of Ad4/7 in this setting would likely require new importation from military recruits and an immunologically naive cohort, which the current vaccination program prevents.",

No previous studies have looked at the occupational or functional results of athletically active patients who have undergone this surgery. In the U.S. Military, the rates of return to unrestricted active duty are unknown.A retrospective review of all active duty military patients who underwent a reconstructive surgery for adult acquired flatfoot surgery at a single institution from January 2001 to 2015 was performed.50 patients met inclusion criteria. 28 of 50 patients (56%) remained on active duty with permanent duty restrictions, and only 2 of 50 patients (4%) returned to full duty without restrictions. 20 of 50 (40%) patients underwent a Medical Evaluation Board to separate from the military. A difference was noted in terms of the hindfoot realignment procedure performed: the probability of a Medical Evaluation Board is higher for those patients who had a lateral column lengthening procedure as compared to those who were treated with a medializing calcaneal osteotomy.The sample size is the largest study to date of young active patients who underwent surgical correction for symptomatic pes planus. The results demonstrate that a service member with symptomatic pes planus requiring surgery faces a 96% chance of failure to return to his or her preinjury level of function. Although some patients (56%) were able to remain on active duty with restrictions, there is a 40% chance that service members will face separation from the military because their foot pain despite a year of surgery and recovery. Furthermore, patients treated with a lateral column lengthening had a higher probability of being medically discharged than those who had a medializing calcaneal osteotomy.",

    "articleAbstract": "In an attempt to maximize treatment outcomes, refractive surgery techniques are being directed toward customized ablations to correct not only lower-order aberrations but also higher-order aberrations specific to the individual eye. Measurement of the entirety of ocular aberrations is the most definitive means to establish the true effect of refractive surgery on image quality and visual performance. Whether or not there is a statistically significant difference in induced higher-order corneal aberrations between the VISX Star S4 (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, California) and the WaveLight EX500 (Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas) lasers was examined.A retrospective analysis was performed to investigate the difference in root-mean-square (RMS) value of the higher-order corneal aberrations postoperatively between two currently available laser platforms, the VISX Star S4 and the WaveLight EX500 lasers. The RMS is a compilation of higher-order corneal aberrations. Data from 240 total eyes of active duty military or Department of Defense beneficiaries who completed photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) or laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) refractive surgery at the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center Joint Warfighter Refractive Surgery Center were examined. Using SPSS statistics software (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York), the mean changes in RMS values between the two lasers and refractive surgery procedures were determined. A Student t test was performed to compare the RMS of the higher-order aberrations of the subjects' corneas from the lasers being studied. A regression analysis was performed to adjust for preoperative spherical equivalent. The study and a waiver of informed consent have been approved by the Clinical Research Division of the 59th Medical Wing Institutional Review Board (Protocol Number: 20150093H).The mean change in RMS value for PRK using the VISX laser was 0.00122, with a standard deviation of 0.02583. The mean change in RMS value for PRK using the WaveLight EX500 laser was 0.004323, with a standard deviation of 0.02916. The mean change in RMS value for LASIK using the VISX laser was 0.00841, with a standard deviation of 0.03011. The mean change in RMS value for LASIK using the WaveLight EX500 laser was 0.0174, with a standard deviation of 0.02417. When comparing the two lasers for PRK and LASIK procedures, the p values were 0.431 and 0.295, respectively.The results of this study suggest no statistically significant difference concerning induced higher-order aberrations between the two laser platforms for either LASIK or PRK. Overall, the VISX laser did have consistently lower induced higher-order aberrations postoperatively, but this did not reach statistical significance. It is likely the statistical significance of this study was hindered by the power, given the relatively small sample size. Additional limitations of the study include its design, being a retrospective analysis, and the generalizability of the study, as the Department of Defense population may be significantly different from the typical refractive surgery population in terms of overall health and preoperative refractive error. Further investigation of visual outcomes between the two laser platforms should be investigated before determining superiority in terms of visual image and quality postoperatively.",

    "articleAbstract": "Hemorrhagic shock with occult hypoperfusion is a key challenge to prehospital staff during triage and transfer of patients, especially during mass casualty incidents. Recent advances in Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and miniaturization of this technology, has resulted in noninvasive sensors capable of continuously monitoring tissue perfusion. This study evaluated the ability of miniature DLS (mDLS) sensors to assess hemodynamic status in a porcine model of hemorrhage.Following ethics committee approval, anesthetized and ventilated pigs underwent graded hemorrhage and then retransfusion. Standard vital signs were monitored in conjunction with a thermodilution cardiac output (CO), central venous pressure (CVP), and arterial blood gases. The mDLS sensor was attached to each animal's leg and all monitoring measurements were taken 5 minutes after completion of each period of hemorrhage and retransfusion to allow equilibration.All measured parameters changed during bleeding and retransfusion. During bleeding; p value were 0.011 for heart rate, 0.07 for CVP, <0.001 for both mean arterial pressure, and mDLS. During retransfusion; p values were 0.023 for heart rate, 0.008 for CVP, and <0.001 for both mean arterial pressure and mDLS. Pearson correlation between changes in mDLS and CO demonstrated r value of 0.917 during hemorrhage and 0.965 during retransfusion. Changes in hemoglobin were not statistically significant during bleeding (p = 0.331) but were during retransfusion (p = 0.0001). Changes of bicarbonate, base excess, and lactate were found to be statistically significant during both phases of the experiment (p = 0.001).In an animal model of hemorrhagic shock, the mDLS sensor strongly correlates with traditional measures of CO. This initial assessment supports further investigation of this technology in human studies.",

    "articleAbstract": "Over 5,300 inguinal hernia repairs (IHR) were performed in the Military Health System in 2015. Chronic pain can be a debilitating complication, occurring in up to 34% of patients after IHR and impacts mission readiness. Gabapentin has been shown to be effective for postoperative analgesia in a variety of operations. We evaluated the effect of a short course of perioperative gabapentin on chronic pain after IHR.This was a double-blinded, randomized study involving male patients ≥18 years old with an initial inguinal hernia and no history of chronic pain or psychiatric disorder. Patients chose laparoscopic or open surgery and were then randomized to receive gabapentin 300 mg before surgery, then three times daily for 6 doses or placebo. There were 50 patients randomized to both the gabapentin and placebo groups for a total of 100 patients. Main outcomes were pain and health status, assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Short Form-12v2 (SF-12v2). Assessments were performed preoperatively and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Analysis of variance was used to compare groups.From the initial 100 patients, 19 withdrew or were excluded. Thus, 81 patients remained, 40 receiving gabapentin and 41 placebo. Throughout the 24-month follow-up, there was no difference in VAS pain scores between the gabapentin and placebo groups (p = 0.867). Beyond 1 month of follow-up, SF-12v2 physical component score (PCS) scores were improved in the gabapentin group (p = 0.039). When comparing open to laparoscopic groups, SF-12v2 PCS scores were improved in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.046) and SF-12v2 mental component summary scores were improved in the open group (p = 0.041).Perioperative gabapentin was not effective in decreasing chronic pain after IHR; however, patient perception of physical health, as measured by SF-12v2, did improve.",

    "articleAbstract": "Fixed facilities and rapid global evacuation ensured that delayed complications of trauma, such as hyperkalemia, occurred late in the evacuation chain where renal replacement therapies were available. However, future conflicts or humanitarian disasters may involve prolonged evacuation times. We sought to quantify one potential risk of delayed evacuation by assessing hyperkalemia in combat casualties.Retrospective study of military members admitted to intensive care units in Iraq and Afghanistan from February 1, 2002, to February 1, 2011. This study was approved by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Institutional Review Board. Demographics, injury severity score, burn injury, mechanism of injury, vital signs, creatinine, and potassium were collected. Logistic regression models were used to identify incidence and risk factors for hyperkalemia.Of 6,011 patient records, 1,472 had sufficient data to be included for analysis. Hyperkalemia occurred in 5.8% of patients. Those with hyperkalemia had higher injury severity scores, higher shock index, were more likely to have acute kidney injury, and were more likely to die. On multivariate analysis, acute kidney injury and shock index were significantly associated with the development of hyperkalemia. In a subgroup of patients with data on creatine kinase, rhabdomyolysis was associated with hyperkalemia in the univariate model, but was not significant after adjustment.Hyperkalemia occurred in 5.8% of patients in our cohort of critically injured combat casualties. The development of hyperkalemia was independently associated with acute kidney injury and shock index. In future conflicts, with prolonged evacuation times, mitigation strategies should be developed to treat hyperkalemia in casualties before arrival at definitive care.",

    "articleAbstract": "Screening of competitive athletes and other individuals exposed to regular and intense physical exercise, such as military personnel, can lead to an early and preclinical identification of cardiac conditions associated with a higher risk for sudden cardiac death. The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been recommended for the precompetitive screening, but its interpretation remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare three different standardized criteria for interpretation of athletes' ECG applied in military.Prospective study of 1,380 consecutive healthy military, 249 (18%) also involved in competitive sport, screened with clinical history, physical examination, and ECG. The ECG was interpreted according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations, the Seattle Criteria (SC), and the Refined Criteria (RC).Independently of the criteria used, the majority of the individuals included had ECG changes, mainly physiological: ESC 55.1%, SC 63.6%, and RC 64.4%. The rate of pathological ECGs was significantly higher with the ESC criteria when compared to SC and RC (ESC 14.8%, SC 5.0% and RC 4.5%; p < 0.001). A significant cardiac abnormality was diagnosed with additional investigations in 4 patients (Brugada syndrome Type 1, mitral valve prolapse, bicuspid aortic valve, and Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern).Electrical cardiac adaptations are frequent in military personnel, similar to competitive athletes. Some ECG changes, previously considered pathological, could in fact correspond to physiological adaptations. The refinement of the ECG interpretation in this athletic population seems to reduce the rate of false-positive cases. This may have a favorable socioeconomic impact, especially by reducing the health cost burden and number of disability days.",

    "articleAbstract": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive cardiac surgical procedure that has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis. This is the most common valvular heart condition in developed countries, affecting 3.4% of those ages 75 and above. Because there is no medical therapy that can arrest progression of the disease, valve replacement forms the cornerstone of therapy.Naval Medical Center San Diego and the VA San Diego Healthcare System have developed a unique collaborative TAVR program-a first in the Department of Defense-to offer this revolutionary procedure to their beneficiaries. Herein, we review development of the program and outcome for patients referred during the first 9 months.Development of the program was a multiyear process made successful because of administrative support, facility upgrades, and collaboration within the crossfacility and multispecialty heart valve team. In the first 9 months, 29 patients were referred for evaluation. Twenty-two (average age 80 years) underwent TAVR, whereas others were deemed nonoperable or were pending disposition at the time of this report. Patients who underwent TAVR had a predicted risk of procedural mortality from surgical aortic valve replacement of 7.7%, similar to other trials and registry studies. After mean follow-up of 5.6 months (range 30-355 days), zero deaths were recorded in the patients who underwent TAVR. Compared to other nonfederal local institutions, the program also realized a cost savings of approximately 17%, or nearly $10,000, per patient.In the first 9 months, results were positive and consistent with expectations from national and international registries. Our hope is that this program may serve as an example for other federal facilities looking to start their own combined programs to improve health care quality and patient experience while simultaneously achieving considerable cost containment within a constrained national health care budget.",

    "articleAbstract": "Between 2009 and 2014, Kabul NATO role 3 hospital provided comprehensive medical services to NATO troops engaged in Afghanistan as well as care for Afghan national security forces and for Afghan and non-Afghan civilians. This study aims at describing the occurrence and the management of cardiovascular diseases in patients presenting to the emergency room or the outpatient clinic or hospitalized for a noncardiovascular reason over a 15-week-long period.The patients for whom cardiologic advice was sought between June 16th and October 1st, 2012, were prospectively included. Demographic and medical data were recorded for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed with Epi Info 3.5.1 software. For continuous variables, data are expressed as mean ± SD. Qualitative variables are expressed as percentages.Cardiologic advice was sought for 52 patients. The patients initially presenting for a cardiovascular reason were mainly non-Afghans; 34.2% of them were experiencing acute coronary syndromes, among whom 76.9% were civilians, working in Afghanistan for non-Afghan companies, and 30.8% had known cardiomyopathies or unexplored symptoms before leaving for Afghanistan. Most of them accumulated cardiovascular risk factors. Three patients among the four presenting with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes presented serious complications (respectively, death, acute heart failure, and failed thrombolysis with no possibility to perform rescue percutaneous coronary intervention). Acute heart failure, acute pulmonary embolism and acute coronary syndrome were the most common reasons for seeking cardiologic advice about patients hospitalized for noncardiovascular diseases.Reasons for seeking cardiologic advice were diverse but acute coronary syndromes in frequently high-risk non-Afghan patients were the most frequent and serious ones. The lack of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic means available within reasonable time resulted in serious complications for most patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Consequently a medical selection seems necessary for civilians sent to work in such conditions, as performed for military personnel. The management of Afghan patients was mainly limited by the lack of local medical infrastructure.",

    "articleAbstract": "The aim of this article is to determine whether some of the urgent (<24 hours) medical evacuations (MEDEVACs) (from French Navy surface ships in isolated situations but with an embarked medical officer) of patients suffering from minor surgical emergencies could have been avoided, and if so, which ones.This was a retrospective descriptive study of all MEDEVAC's performed between 2009 and 2014. This was done by an analysis of the records held at the French Naval Medical Headquarters that included both MEDEVAC signals and anonymized files called \"Patient Movement Request.\"560 MEDEVACs were performed from French Navy surface ships which most had an embarked medical officer but which were in isolated situations. Only 34 (6.1%) of the total evacuations were suffering from minor surgical emergencies. The majority of these were nonurgent MEDEVAC's of whom 17 (50%) had no surgical procedure attempted on board. Seven (20%) underwent urgent MEDEVAC and only 2 of them had undergone the indicated therapeutic procedure on board. The most common pathology was displaced fracture of the fifth metacarpal (29.4%) before deep abscess (17.6%).Contrary to our initial expectation, the operational impact of minor surgical emergencies remains low, which might suggest that a French naval medical doctor's training is sufficient in this particular field. However, 50% of the overall evacuated patients and 71% of the \"urgent\" MEDEVACs (<24 hours) did not undergo the indicated, simple surgical procedure before evacuation. The idea of introducing a specific training program for these procedures may therefore still have value.",

    "articleAbstract": "In 2006, burn clinical practice guidelines were developed to provide recommendations for optimal care of U.S. military and local national burn casualties. As part of that effort, a paper-based Burn Flow Sheet (BFS) was included to document the burn resuscitation of combat casualties with ≥20% total body surface area burns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the BFS in terms of ongoing utilization, resuscitation management, and outcomes of patients transported.A retrospective review was performed of hard-copy BFSs received from January 2007 to December 2013. En route injury and treatment data from these flowsheets were manually transcribed into the research database. Outcomes and complications of BFS subjects were extracted from the Burn Center Registry and added to the research database.A total of 73 BFSs were collected from the study period. On average, BFSs were 61 ± 30% complete with a total of 14.7 ± 7 hours documented per patient in the first 24-hours postburn. Patients received nearly 7 L more fluid than estimated by traditional formulas. Sixteen patients (26%) received greater than 250 mL/kg of fluid, half of whom had concomitant traumatic injuries. Fifteen patients received a fasciotomy (21%), 4 received a laparotomy (5%), and 8 (11%) received both. No patients developed abdominal compartment syndrome associated with fluid resuscitation. Overall mortality was 21%.Although the majority of providers did initiate a BFS, it was not always used as intended; problems included missing data and miscalculations. Although there was a clear improvement with decline in the incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, mortality did not change for severely burned patients. Simplification of the recommendations, additional built-in prompts, and automated tools such as computerized decision support software may help standardize practice and improve outcomes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Gunshot injuries, blast injuries, and major contusions can cause extensive extremity defects. In countries with damaged or destroyed infrastructure, local national patients with these injuries pose a challenge. Deployed medical facilities of the German Armed Forces provide medical care to these patients as part of their humanitarian activities. Reconstructive techniques, for example, microvascular free tissue transfer, can be used only to a limited extent in such settings, which require safe and simple (outpatient) procedures. The focus of treatment is not on cosmetic aspects but on rapidly restoring function. Low-resource settings require ethical and medical compromises. It is still a topic of the discussion which reconstructive surgical procedures could be performed in a deployment mission and which should be in the portfolio of the deployed surgeon.We conducted a retrospective analysis of a sample of 550 patients who received definitive treatment from seven surgeons from a single German Armed Forces hospital during a total of 47 tours of duty (i.e., 94 months) with the International Security Assistance Force in Feyzabad, Kunduz, and Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. The deployed surgeons (authors) were given an Excel spreadsheet and were asked to enter details on the surgical procedures they had performed in the deployed setting on the basis of operative reports.Local and pedicled flaps were used in 73 cases to cover extensive soft-tissue defects and preserve the affected limbs. Improvised distraction osteogenesis was used in 18 patients to manage large bone defects. In 13 cases, bone defects were temporarily filled with a cement spacer (Masquelet technique). Fourteen patients required a combination of soft-tissue and bone reconstruction.Simple surgical reconstructive procedures are available that enable surgeons to preserve the shape and function of an injured limb with limited resources. This emphasizes the need either to make these techniques a mandatory part of training not only for surgeons who are deployed to combat zones and disaster areas but also for surgeons working for civilian relief organizations or to ensure that surgical teams are composed in such a way that these techniques are available.",

    "articleAbstract": "Krav-Maga (KM) is a unique Israeli hand-to-hand combat system, designed to teach soldiers self-defense in true-to-life situations. With the increase in military Israel Defense Force (IDF) units participating in KM training in recent years, the number of injuries incurred in KM has also increased. The purpose of our report is to describe the prevalence and pattern of these injuries.Instances of KM injury were taken from IDF patients' computerized clinical records over a 1-year period. Data pertaining to the type, location, and severity of the injury, as well as data relating to soldier's gender and age were collected from the charts. \"Moderate\" injury was defined as injury necessitating absence from military activity for more than 1 week; \"major\" injury was defined as injury necessitating surgical intervention.During the year 2014, 916 soldiers complaining of 946 traumatic injuries sustained during KM training were evaluated in IDF clinics. The vast majority of injuries (95%) occurred in male soldiers, and most injured soldiers (92%) were between the ages of 18 and 22. The upper limbs were the most frequently injured body parts, with the fingers, hands, and wrists being the most involved regions (31%) followed by the shoulder (16%). Injury severity was mild in most cases. However, 64 soldiers (6.7%) were moderately injured and major injuries necessitating surgical treatment occurred in 33 cases (3.5%).KM involves both striking and grappling elements, and we assume that injuries result from both fighting forms. With striking styles, such as boxing and kickboxing, hand and wrist are the prevalent injury locations; with grappling styles such as wrestling, strain and sprain injuries of large joints are most prevalent. Head and neck injuries, a major concern in martial arts sports, were not identified as significant problems in KM. To minimize participant injury, preventative measures should focus on improving protective equipment, especially of the hand, as well as warm up and training technique modifications, and shoulder strengthening exercises.",

    "articleAbstract": "In 2011, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) modified its duty hour standards for interns and residents. This was done, in part, because of a belief that increased compliance with these standards was needed to positively impact resident fatigue, resident quality of life, and patient safety. However, several studies indicate that duty hour noncompliance and false reporting by interns and residents remains a significant concern for residency program directors. This study examined the compliance of interns and residents with ACGME duty hour standards at a large military graduate medical education (GME) training program.We conducted a survey of 535 trainees assigned to 24 GME programs within the National Capital Consortium (NCC). Statistical analysis for descriptive parameters used a standard error of measure on the basis of sample and target population sizes to calculate two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A χ(2) analysis was performed to compare response differences for particular survey questions. A Cronbach α coefficient was calculated to compare the internal consistency of responses for questions in which individual responses were expected to correlate. This study was reviewed by the Offices of Research at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University and adjudicated as \"Not Research.\"Overall, 41.3% (N = 221) of those contacted completed all survey questions. From the available responses, 31.6% (95% CI, 26.9-36.2) reported at least one occurrence of implicit pressure to alter duty hour reporting, and 32.0% (95% CI, 27.3-36.7) reported at least one occurrence of altering reported duty hours. In addition, 37.2 (95% CI, 32.5-41.9) reported being unable to always follow duty hour limits and 58.1% (95% CI, 53.1-63.1) felt time working at home on residency requirements should be included in reported duty hours.Our results indicate that a significant portion of interns and residents within the NCC were unable to consistently follow ACGME duty hour standards and various systemic barriers within the GME training environment may have contributed. To remove or mitigate these barriers, we recommend using an approach similar to those of \"high-reliability organizations\" in which organizational processes are systematically investigated to improve safety, quality, and efficiency. Additional surveys or cognitive interviewing within the NCC and at other military GME training sites could be used to help refine these barriers, discover other barriers, determine the scope of these issues within the entire military GME training system, and to measure the outcome of correction actions.",

    "articleAbstract": "The Society of Military Orthopaedic Surgeons (SOMOS) is a robust academic organization with more than 1,000 members and has held annual academic scientific meetings since 1958. Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding the volume and quality of orthopaedic surgery presentations accepted for peer-reviewed publication. The purpose of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) What is the publication acceptance rate for abstract presented at SOMOS meetings? (2) What is the distribution by orthopaedic subspecialty for SOMOS presentations accepted for publication? (3) What is the overall quality of these publications?Abstracts of podium presentations at SOMOS were reviewed from 2009 to 2013. Author institutional information was obtained. Abstracts were then queried in PubMed to obtain publication status, time to publication, and impact factor of the journal in which the manuscript was successfully published.From 2009 to 2013, 592 abstracts were presented at the SOMOS conference. Overall, 59% of abstracts went on to publication at a mean of 18.1 months. Published manuscripts appeared in 59 journals with a mean impact factor of 2.6. The subspecialties of spine (67%) and basic science (66%) achieved the highest abstract publication rate while sports had the highest mean impact factor (3.3).The annual SOMOS meeting is a productive academic event, producing quality presentations resulting in a high manuscript publication rate in every orthopaedic surgery subspecialty. This is the first series to demonstrate overall productivity of a general orthopaedic surgery scientific meeting as well as the subspecialty-specific impact factors of published investigations.",

    "articleAbstract": "U.S. Army internists serve in a variety of provider roles during deployment, many of which vary from the traditional responsibilities of a general internist or internal medicine subspecialist. There is significant interest in defining specific clinical and procedural skills in which Army internists may require refresher training after deployment, but information to quantify and clarify these needs is lacking.An online, anonymous survey was created to assess Army internists' experience and comfort level with specialty-specific problems and procedures before and after deployment. This survey was distributed via the Army Central Simulation Committee to all U.S. Army internists eligible for deployment. The survey was available online from January 11, 2012, to March 9, 2012.Ninety-seven of all 115 (84%) U.S. Army internists eligible for deployment responded. The reported comfort level with core clinical problems in general internal medicine before and after deployment did not change, with the exception of decreased comfort with the performance of advanced cardiac life support (87% versus 76% comfortable, p = 0.035), evaluation and management of anemia (92% versus 83% comfortable, p = 0.039), and comfort with preoperative risk stratification and mitigation (81% versus 65% comfortable, p = 0.017). Providers' reported comfort level performing core internal medicine procedures decreased, including significant decreases with lumbar puncture (p < 0.001), arterial line placement (p = 0.02), ultrasound-guided central line placement (p = 0.01), ultrasound-guided thoracentesis (p = 0.004), and arthrocentesis (p = 0.01). Despite a reported deceased comfort with certain core clinical problems and procedural skills, only 10 of 68 (13%) respondents reported being offered refresher skills training following deployment.Although Army internists' comfort with core general internal medicine clinical problems remains largely unaffected by deployment, confidence in core internal medicine procedures suffers because of limited opportunities to practice these skills in the deployed setting. Skills training and assessment in procedures required for individual provider practice should be a primary focus of reintegration after deployment.",

    "articleAbstract": "The U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) is the largest commissioning source among all branches. Physical Readiness Training (PRT) is fundamental to ROTC cadet training. However, although studies have evaluated the effectiveness of PRT in cadets with prior PRT experience, no study has examined the early phase adaptations in those cadets with no prior PRT experience.To determine the effect of PRT over the course of an academic year (9 months) in freshmen ROTC cadets, thirteen (n = 13; 7 male [180.8 ± 4.7 cm, 77.4 ± 10.0 kg; 19.8 ± 6.5 % body fat], 6 female [159.5 ± 12.1 cm; 63.4 ± 8.4 kg; 29.6 ± 6.2% body fat]) cadets with no prior PRT performed laboratory (body composition, 1-repetition maximum [1RM] bench and squat, countermovement vertical jump, maximal aerobic capacity [VO2max]) and field-based ([Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) (2 minutes maximum push-ups and sit-ups, 2-mile run)]) measures of performance before (PRE), mid-year (MID), and at the conclusion of the academic year (POST). PRT was performed 3 times per week in accordance with Army standards.No changes occurred in body composition, VO2max, or countermovement vertical jump. 1RM bench improved at MID in men (PRE, 78.5 ± 8.4 kg; MID, 84.7 ± 8.0 kg) and women (PRE, 42.0 ± 10.2 kg; MID, 46.2 ± 10.9 kg) with no further improvement. Women improved 1RM back squat (PRE, 55.3 ± 13.5 kg; POST, 74.6 ± 14.6 kg) and APFT tests: push-ups (PRE, 27 ± 10; POST, 39 ± 12), sit-ups (PRE, 55 ± 19; POST, 74 ± 12), 2-mile run (PRE, 18.6 ± 2.9; POST, 17.2 ± 1.3 minutes); although men improved in push-ups (PRE, 54 ± 6; POST, 67 ± 8) and sit-ups (PRE, 63 ± 8; POST, 75 ± 9).Nine months of PRT improved APFT scores of freshmen cadets while minor effects were noted in laboratory-based performance. Given the lack of improvements in strength and power, it would be advisable to provide supplemental strength and power training. Being a large commissioning resource for the Army with greater access to equipment and resources, the time spent in ROTC may be a unique opportunity to improve and educate young commissioning officers on the benefits of proper strength and power training for the use in future commands while units are considerably smaller and equipment is more accessible on university grounds.",

    "articleAbstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Preventive efforts mainly target the reduction of modifiable CVD risk factors through community-based promotion programs. One of these programs is the National Guard Health Promotion Program for Chronic Diseases and Comorbid Conditions among military personnel in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia. Researchers have asserted that to improve every intervention program, especially those targeting public health issues, regular monitoring and evaluation are needed to determine the strength and weakness of the program. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of National Guard Health Promotion Program for Chronic Diseases and Comorbid Conditions among military personnel in Jeddah City by estimating Framingham risk score, diabetes risk score, and satisfaction level for the participants covered by the program for at least 6 months.Through pre- and poststudy design, a systematic random sample of military personnel who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (n = 267) were enrolled in the study. To assess the program's effectiveness, participants were subjected to clinical and laboratory assessment based mainly on Framingham risk scores before and after involvement in the program; satisfaction was assessed concurrently using a self-administered questionnaire. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare changes in non-normally distributed quantitative variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of risk of CVDs.The subjects were all military men, with mean age of 35.8 ± 6.6 years; 6% officers with the remainder \"non-officers\" primarily working in the combat services. After at least 6 months of the preventive program, there were statistically significant decreases in body mass index (-0.4 ± 1.5 kg/m(2)), waist circumference (-0.9 ± 6.2 cm), fasting blood glucose (-12.3 ± 29.6 mg/dL), and total cholesterol (-15.4 ± 40.2 mg/dL). Despite this observed improvement, the overall Framingham risk score showed a modest nonsignificant change (-0.1 ± 2.1 points). Similarly, although specific predictors scores of diabetes mellitus showed significant improvement (decreased blood glucose [-0.4 ± 1.8 points] and increased fruit and vegetable consumption [-0.2 ± 0.6 points]), there was no significant change in the overall diabetes risk score (-0.01 ± 2.5). The majority of the participants (96%) expressed that they were satisfied with the program.The National Guard Health Promotion Program is effective in improving specific risk factors such as body mass index, waist circumference, blood glucose, and intake of fruits and vegetables; in addition, it was perceived as being satisfactory. Nevertheless, it had no statistically significant impact on the overall total risk scores for CVDs and diabetes mellitus.",

    "articleAbstract": "Musculoskeletal disorders are common among military personnel, especially during the initial basic training period. Prior studies have reported the prevalence rate of overall musculoskeletal symptoms or injuries in different military population and nationalities, especially from North America and Europe; however, very limited information regarding the military population of South America exists. Although Brazil has one of the biggest military forces worldwide (≈335,000 military personnel), currently, to our knowledge, there is no study reporting musculoskeletal symptoms or injury statistics in the Brazilian Armed Forces. Thus, the aims of this study were to describe the 12-month prevalence rate of self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms in cadets and to compare this prevalence rate between sexes and school years.We conducted a cross-sectional study that took place from January to March 2016. Participants were Navy cadets, of both sexes and from three different school years of a Brazilian Merchant Navy Academy. All volunteers completed an adapted version of the Brazilian Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire that assessed the past 12-month prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms over eight body regions of the trunk and lower extremity. The Pearson's χ(2) test was conducted to compare prevalence of symptoms per body region between sexes and among the 3 school years. The study has been approved by the Naval Hospital's ethical committee.A total of 545 cadets (394 males), corresponding to 79% of all 688 cadets enrolled at the Merchant Navy Academy, volunteered to participate on this study. Among all cadets, 266 (49%) reported symptoms in at least one body region in the past 12-months. The knee with 116 (21%) and lower back with 96 (18%), were the most prevalent regions. In terms of sex differences, there was higher prevalence of symptoms among females 90 (60%) than males 176 (45%). Furthermore, females reported almost double the prevalence for lower back symptoms (27% vs. 14%, p = 0.001) and 11% higher prevalence of knee symptoms (29% vs. 18%, p = 0.006) than males. Finally, it is important to highlight that cadets from the second (127 [65%]) and third (77 [55%]) school years had higher prevalence of symptoms than cadets from the first year (62 [29%]). The knee and lower back were consistently the two most prevalent regions among all school years, but shin symptoms increased from 3% to 17% (p < 0.001) between the first and second school years.The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the Brazilian Merchant Navy Academy doubles between initial enrollment and the beginning of the second school year. Females have consistently higher rates of symptoms than males, particularly reporting higher prevalence of knee and lower back pain which are the two most prevalent regions in this population. Prevention efforts should concentrate on the basic training period in an attempt to decrease the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in this population. Finally, prospective studies are required to verify the cause and effect relationship between training and musculoskeletal symptoms.",

    "articleAbstract": "Low-back pain (LBP) is a leading cause for disability in military personnel. Consequently, effective management strategies are required to maintaining operational capabilities. Physical therapy clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of directional preference (DP) to guide management. The effectiveness of this approach has not been tested in military personnel using a pragmatic study design. Pragmatic studies are ideal to inform clinicians and policymakers about the usefulness of proven interventions in real-life clinical conditions. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine, in clinical practice, the effectiveness of a management approach guided by DP vs. usual care (UC) physical therapy in Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members with LBP.A pragmatic study was conducted among 44 consecutive CAF members with LBP who received management guided by DP (n = 22) or UC (n = 22). Outcomes were pain intensity (primary outcome), pain location and frequency, perceived disability, medication use, perceived global effect (pain, function, overall status), work loss, and health care utilization. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed at 1-month and 3-months follow-up.Statistically significant differences favoring the DP group were observed for pain intensity (Δ 1 month: 1.9/10; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.97-2.89; Δ 3 months: 1.3/10; 95% CI: 0.35-2.31), pain location at 1 month (54.5% vs. 19.0%; p = 0.02) and 3 months (68.2% vs. 38.1%; p = 0.01), disability (Δ 1 month: 4.3/24; 95% CI: 2.12-6.38; Δ 3 months: 3.5/24; 95% CI; 1.59-5.33), perceived global effect at 1 month (pain: 86.4% vs. 57.1%; function: 81.8% vs. 47.6%; overall status: 86.4% vs. 57.1%) and 3 months (pain: 95.5% vs. 71.1%; overall status: 95.5% vs. 66.7%) with p values < 0.05, and improvement in work status at 3 months (54.5% vs. 23.8%; p = 0.04).DP-guided management appears more effective than UC physical therapy to reduce pain and improve function in CAF members with LBP. Rapid improvements and the patient's ability to self-manage may prove especially advantageous in deployed settings. Our findings are particularly useful to inform military policymakers and clinicians on optimal management for CAF members.",

    "articleAbstract": "Moral injury describes the deleterious effects of acts of commission (e.g., killing noncombatants), omission (e.g., failing to prevent a massacre), or betrayal (i.e., by a trusted authority figure) during military service that transgress accepted behavioral boundaries and norms. Transgressive acts are proposed to lead to a guilt- and shame-based syndrome consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, demoralization, self-handicapping, and self-injury. In this study, we tested a frequently cited model of moral injury and assessed the associations between potentially transgressive acts, moral injury outcomes, and guilt and fear. Additionally, we sought to clarify the relative contribution of transgressive and nontransgressive/general combat exposure to moral injury. On the basis of previous research and theory, we anticipated that the transgressive acts would be related to outcomes through guilt and that nontransgressive combat exposure would be related to outcomes through fear.Secondary analysis was conducted on data from a sample of combat-exposed male veterans at a Midwestern Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (N = 190) who participated in a larger parent study on postdeployment readjustment. Structural equation modeling was used to test the pathways from transgressive and nontransgressive combat exposure to PTSD symptoms and suicidality through combat-related guilt and combat-related fear. The institutional review boards of the Midwestern VA medical center and the university of the affiliated researchers approved the study.In total, 38% (n = 72) of the sample reported a potentially transgressive act as one of their three worst traumatic events. The most common potentially transgressive act was killing an enemy combatant (17%; n = 32). In structural equation modeling analyses. potentially transgressive acts were indirectly related to both suicidality (β = 0.09, p < 0.01) and PTSD symptoms (β = 0.06, p < 0.05) through guilt. General combat exposure was indirectly related to PTSD through fear, β = 0.19, p < 0.01. Combat exposure was not directly or indirectly related to suicidality.Overall, these findings suggest that veterans with a history of potentially transgressive acts may present to the VA with a constellation of symptoms that are associated with combat-related guilt. Transgressive acts were identified using a qualitative approach, allowing a broader sampling of this domain. Results were limited by the use of self-report data and by gathering data from participants who were Veterans seeking compensation and pension evaluations for PTSD. The clinical implications suggest that focusing on fear-related outcomes and ignoring guilt- and shame-based reactions may lead to an incomplete case conceptualization. Clinicians working with veterans with moral injury are encouraged to prepare themselves for the discomfiting therapeutic experiences of bearing witness to and empathizing with clients' memories of their actions, which may include atrocities. Effective and empathic treatments that address the guilt and shame associated with transgressive acts are needed to adequately care for returning veterans.",

    "articleAbstract": "Anger is a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with a range of clinical and functional impairments, and may be especially prevalent among veterans with PTSD. Effective anger management therapies exist but may be undermined by poor engagement or lack of treatment availability. Finding ways to engage veterans in anger management therapy or to improve access can be helpful in improving clinical outcomes. This randomized controlled trial compared anger management treatment (AMT) with AMT augmented by a mobile application (app) system, Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX).Participants were 58 veterans enrolled in 12 sessions of either AMT alone or AMT with the RELAX system (AMT + RELAX). The RELAX system includes the RELAX app, a wearable heart rate monitor, a remote server, and a web-based therapist interface. RELAX allows the user to practice skills, monitor symptoms, and record physiological data. The server collects data on app use. A web-based interface allows the therapist to access data on between-session practice, and skills use. Measures administered at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-and 6-month follow-up include state and trait anger, dimensions of anger, PTSD, depression, interpersonal functioning, and satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nesting of time points within participants and participants within treatment groups. Predictors were Treatment Condition (AMT + RELAX and AMT), Linear Time (baseline, post-treatment, 3-and 6-month follow-up), and Quadratic Time and Treatment Condition × Linear Time interaction. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (Armonk, New York). Approval was obtained from the institutional review board.Across groups, the treatment dropout rate was 13.8%; of those who remained in treatment, 90% received an adequate dose of treatment (10 or more sessions). There were no significant differences between groups on attendance or treatment completion. Participants in both treatments demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in anger severity and significant post-treatment reductions in PTSD. Veterans did not report significant changes in depression or interpersonal functioning. Veterans in the AMT + RELAX group reported spending significantly less time on homework assignments, and they rated the AMT + RELAX app as helpful and easy to use, with these ratings improving over time.Findings suggest that AMT + RELAX was beneficial in reducing anger symptoms and promoting efficient use of the between-session practice; however, AMT + RELAX did not outperform AMT. This study is an important contribution as it is one of the first randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of a technology-enhanced, evidence-based psychotherapy for anger management. Findings are limited because of small sample size and modifications to the technology during the trial. However, the results highlight the possible benefits of mobile app-supported treatment, including increasing the accessibility of treatment, lowering therapist workload, reducing costs of treatment, reducing practice time, and enabling new activities and types of treatments. This study presents preliminary evidence that mobile apps can be a valuable addition to treatment for patients with anger difficulties. Future research should evaluate how much therapist involvement is needed to support anger management.",

    "articleAbstract": "Many veterans experience significant compromised spiritual and mental well-being. Despite effective and evidence-based treatments, veterans continue to experience poor completion rates and suboptimal therapeutic effects. Spirituality, whether expressed through religious or secular means, is a part of adjunctive or supplemental treatment modalities to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is particularly relevant to combat trauma. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between spirituality and mental well-being in postdeployment veterans.Electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, JSTOR) were searched from database inception to March 2016. Gray literature was identified in databases, websites, and reference lists of included studies. Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraising Skill Programme Qualitative Checklist.From 6,555 abstracts, 43 studies were included. Study quality was low-moderate. Spirituality had an effect on PTSD, suicide, depression, anger and aggression, anxiety, quality of life, and other mental well-being outcomes for veterans. \"Negative spiritual coping\" was often associated with an increase mental health diagnoses and symptom severity; \"positive spiritual coping\" had an ameliorating effect.Addressing veterans' spiritual well-being should be a routine and integrated component of veterans' health, with regular assessment and treatment. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, including integrating chaplains postcombat, to help address these issues and enhance the continuity of care. Further high-quality research is needed to isolate the salient components of spirituality that are most harmful and helpful in veterans' mental well-being, including the incorporating of veterans' perspectives directly.",

    "articleAbstract": "Military suicide remains a significant concern in many countries. Most psychological autopsy studies in this field focused on certain psychological comorbidities with suicide, namely depression, quality of life, sporadically in different populations. However, much less attention has been paid to Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is among the most common neuropsychiatric conditions in youth. This study aimed to test the associations between childhood ADHD symptoms and several suicidal behaviors, namely suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, and suicidal attempts. We, then, tested whether these associations would be mediated by the level of current depression and quality of life in military recruits.A total of 1,047 military recruits (all male, aged 20-34 years) participated in this questionnaire survey. The participants completed the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, Version IV Scale-Chinese version for ADHD symptoms before 12 years old; the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition, for depressive symptoms and quality of life for the past 6 months; the Adult ADHD Quality-of-Life Scale; and the questions about current self-harm/suicidal behaviors on the Adult Self-Report Scale Inventory-4-Chinese version. Mediation analyses with bootstrapping of total indirect effects were used for statistical analyses.Our Results revealed significant associations between recalled childhood ADHD symptoms/diagnosis (age 6-12 years) and all the three current suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, and suicidal attempts; all p values <0.001). Mediation analyses revealed that all these relationships were significantly and partially mediated by depression (all p values <0.05) and quality of life (p value <0.05, but not for suicidal attempts).The major findings of this study include that the ADHD-suicidality association is partially explained by the mediating effects of depression and quality of life, and that recalled ADHD symptoms had a stronger association with suicide attempt than with suicidal ideation in military recruits. Moreover, our finding of the highest direct effect of ADHD and lowest indirect effects of depression and quality of life on self-harm behavior indicates different associated patterns between deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation and attempts. Our findings concord Nock's suggestion that different prevention strategies for suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, and suicidal attempts are warranted because of distinct courses and underlying psychopathology. This study is limited by a lack of psychiatric interview to make the diagnosis of ADHD and other psychiatric disorders, and only recruiting young men without female participants leading the generalization of our results to young women is questionable. Moreover, the lack of temporal data in this study prohibits us extend our findings to establish causality. The findings imply that assessment and intervention of depression and poor quality of life may help offset suicidal behaviors among military recruits with ADHD symptoms and/or diagnosis. Further investigations about interactions among those factors are warranted.",

    "articleAbstract": "Military veterans diagnosed with dementia compose a large portion of our population. Often ignored are their caregivers and their plight as well as the availability, quality, and accessibility of health care for this demographic. The purpose of this systematic literature review is three fold: to identify opportunities available to increase public awareness on the subject; to identify areas of improvement in the level of care and quality of life for our nation's veterans; and to identify if adequate resources are available to veterans with dementia and their caregivers.The authors conducted systematic searches of three databases: PubMed via The National Center for Biotechnology Information, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Complete via Ebson B. Stephens Company (EBSCO Host), and Google. Data were collected regarding providing care to veterans who are suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers between 2008 and June 2016. Search results were filtered by date range, full text, English language, Boolean operators, and academic journals (n = 14).The review confirmed there are many facilitators and barriers in the coordination of care offered to veterans with dementia. Facilitators of quality care include veteran's expectations, family support, program development, and the availability of services. These positive aspects are aided by several community-based support services, new technology, and preventative care. Barriers are caregiver expectations, coordination of care, providers, and informal and formal costs. These negative facets are due to lack of educational resources, an increased veteran population diagnosed with dementia, limited knowledge of resources, and limited medical service in rural areas.Overall, there are a number of community programs that want to, and can, help veterans with dementia. There are also a number of ways to help veterans with dementia cope with their issues, which include technology and preventative care. Veterans are hindered from receiving help with their dementia concerns due to most veteran's dependence on the Veterans Affairs (VA) for health services, a lack of education about possible treatments and programs, and a lack of services in rural areas. This review will prove useful to providers when evaluating the expansion of VA services and caregiver interventions.",

    "articleAbstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects nearly one-fifth of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans (IAV). The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has invested in making evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD available at every VA facility nationwide; however, an unknown number of veterans opt to receive care in the community rather than with VA. We compared PTSD care utilization patterns among Texas IAV with PTSD, an ethnically, geographically, and economically diverse group.To identify IAV in Texas with service-connected disability for PTSD, we used a crosswalk of VA administrative data from the Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Roster and service-connected disability data from the Veterans Benefits Administration. We then surveyed a random sample of 1,128 veterans from the cohort, stratified by sex, rurality, and past use/nonuse of any VA care. Respondents were classified into current utilization groups (VA only, non-VA only, dual care, and no professional PTSD treatment) on the basis of reported PTSD care in the prior 12 months. Responses were weighted to account for sample stratification and for response rate within each strata. Utilization group characteristics were compared to the population mean using the one sample Z-test for proportions, or the t-test for means. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify survey variables significantly associated with current utilization group.249 IAV completed the survey (28.4% response rate). Respondents reported receiving PTSD care: in the VA only (58.3%); in military or community-based settings (including private practitioners) (non-VA only, 8.7%); and in both VA and non-VA settings (dual care, 14.5%). The remainder (18.5%) reported no professional PTSD care in the prior year. Veterans ineligible for Department of Defense care, uncomfortable talking about their problems, and opposed to medication were more likely to receive non-VA care only, whereas those with lower household income, <50% service connection for PTSD, and reporting high stoicism were more likely to receive no professional treatment. The best model constructed from survey variables correctly predicted utilization group 76% of the time, whereas a model constructed only from variables currently available in VA data predicted utilization group correctly 64% of the time. Important variables distinguishing utilization groups included household income, percent PTSD service connection, routine use of VA health care, having non-VA insurance, past PTSD care at a VA facility or at a community-based facility, attitudes regarding medication, discomfort with mental health care seeking, and perceived treatment efficacy in community-based settings.These findings suggest that preferences for care setting among IAV with PTSD have less influence on care utilization than actual access factors such as household income and service connection. Given that nearly a quarter of respondents indicated receiving as least some PTSD care in community settings, working toward seamless VA/non-VA care coordination remains an important goal for ensuring high-quality care.",

    "articleAbstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated health problems among veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom). Veterans from these conflicts have a higher prevalence of mental disorders and physical diseases, though most studies were conducted using administrative data.This study analyzes data from the National Health Study for a New Generation of U.S. Veterans, a population-based survey that collected data on Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans between 2009 and 2011. Weighted prevalence estimates of deployed and nondeployed veterans were calculated for SF-12 general health perception and clinic and hospital visits. Weighted mean physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores were calculated by demographic and military characteristics. Weighted, adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and prevalence estimates were calculated for physician-diagnosed medical conditions comparing deployed to nondeployed veterans.Of 60,000 veterans sampled, 20,563 responded to the survey (response rate = 34%). Deployed veterans had increased odds for significant hearing loss (aOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.35, 1.63), and lower odds for arthritis (aOR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.83, 0.98), diabetes (aOR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.58, 0.84), and migraines (aOR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.80, 0.97) compared to nondeployed veterans. The prevalence of clinic visits was nearly equal between deployed and nondeployed veterans, though nondeployed veterans reported a higher percentage of hospitalizations that were overnight or longer. The SF-12 MCS was higher among the nondeployed group compared to the deployed group (p < 0.0001), though the deployed group reported a higher PCS compared to the nondeployed (p < 0.0001). The SF-12 MCS and PCS were lower than the U.S. population mean of 50.Deployed veterans are at increased risk for some health conditions; however, nondeployed veterans also report a variety of health conditions. Addressing the unique health concerns of both deployed and nondeployed veterans is important and continued observation of all veterans is recommended.",

    "articleAbstract": "Triage is the act of stratifying the need for medical attention. Effective triage must account for injury patterns and severity. Personnel making triage decisions must also consider the patients' physiologic states. Vital signs can possibly be used to assess for the presence of physiological derangements such as coagulopathy, acidosis, or a significant base deficit. Providers could use this knowledge to assist with triage at casualty collection points where laboratory studies or point of care testing may not be available.With institutional approval, data were extracted from the Joint Theater Trauma Registry for all patients with thoracic trauma between 2002 and 2012. Patients were identified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and pulse pressure were correlated with coagulopathy (international normalization ratio ≥ 1.5), acidosis (pH < 7.2) or an elevated base deficit (>6) on admission. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and odds ratios were calculated.HR > 100, SBP < 90, or pulse pressure <30 were associated with an increased risk for acidosis (odds ratio 3.06 [95% confidence interval 2.48-3.78], 4.72 [3.85-5.78], and 2.73 [2.15-3.48], respectively), coagulopathy (2.21 [1.72-2.83], 4.55 [3.57-5.80], and 2.73 [2.15-3.48], respectively), and base deficit >6 (2.17 [1.88-2.50], 3.48 [2.87-4.22], and 2.22 [1.78-2.77], respectively). HR was a moderately sensitive marker (0.74), whereas SBP was a specific marker (0.93).SBP < 90 is an effective marker for ruling in physiologic derangement after thoracic trauma. HR > 100 was associated with over twice the odds for physiologic derangement. Vital signs can be used to assess for physiologic derangement in the population studied and may help in triage.",

    "articleAbstract": "Air Force Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATTs) provide fixed-wing aeromedical evacuation for combat casualties. Multiple studies have evaluated CCATT trauma patients; however, nearly 50% of patients medically evacuated from combat theaters are for nontraumatic medical illnesses to include stroke, myocardial infarctions, overdose, and pulmonary emboli. Published data are limited regarding illness types, in-flight procedures, and adverse events.The objective of our study was to characterize patients with nontraumatic medical illnesses transferred via CCATT to include a description of in-flight procedures and events.We performed a retrospective review of CCATT medical records of patients with nontraumatic medical illnesses transported via CCATT from theater of operations to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center between January 2007 and April 2015. We abstracted data from CCATT records to include demographics, description of current illness, vital signs, labs, in-flight procedures and medications, and in-flight adverse events. Following descriptive analysis, comparative tests were performed based on service status of patients and primary diagnoses.We reviewed 672 records of critically ill medical patients transported via CCATT, most of whom were male (90%, n = 606). Approximately 56% of the patients were U.S. active duty members; the remainder included U.S. contractors and civilians, and foreign citizens or unknown. The three categories (active duty, contractor/civilian, foreign/unknown) significantly differed from one another in age. Over half of the patients received a primary or secondary cardiac diagnosis. The most common in-flight procedures and medications included supplementary oxygenation, anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications, analgesics, and ventilation. Up to 20% of patients required continuous medication infusions other than analgesics. Patients most frequently experienced in-flight complications related to their primary diagnoses.Fifty-six percent (672) of 1,209 CCATT records that were queried were of patients with medical conditions. The most common primary diagnoses of CCATT medical patients were cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological in etiology. Mechanical ventilation and continuous medication infusions were required in approximately 20% of patients. The data provided by this study may assist in guiding future CCATT training requirements and resource allocation, as well as clinical practice guideline development.",

    "articleAbstract": "To compare the incidence of intrauterine device (IUD) provision within the beneficiary population of a military tertiary care facility from 2008 to 2014 and in correlation with the publication of landmark contemporary guidelines for contraceptive use.This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a military tertiary care facility using coding data to examine the trend in IUD provision correlated with published contraceptive practice guidelines from November 2008 to December 2014. The incidence of device provision was calculated per 1,000 female beneficiaries more than the age of 14 per month. The primary outcome was the mean monthly incidence of IUD in correlation with publication of the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (2010) and the Practice Guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2011). For the subset of provisions that occurred by Family Medicine providers, the American Academy of Family Physicians (2012) was the second comparison clinical guideline.A total of 3,950 IUDs were placed during the study period. There was a statistically significant increase in the overall mean monthly incidence of IUD placement from 0.48 (SE 0.04) before guideline publication to 1.96 (SE 0.07) after the publications (analysis of variance, p < 0.01). Each publication was associated with a statistically significant sequential increase in the incidence of IUD provision. The incidence of provision remained elevated above baseline levels (range 0.93-3.03) for the 34 studied months after the 2011 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Guideline.The incidence of IUD provision significantly increased during the study period and in association with published guidelines guiding contraceptive management.",

To minimize barriers to contraception and improve access to care for family planning needs, a novel full-service walk-in clinic for contraception was created. The objective of this study is to describe utilization of a walk-in contraceptive clinic including patient demographics, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) initiation rates, projected cost savings, and patient satisfaction within the first 6 months of operation.This is a prospective cohort and quality improvement study of 2,207 women presenting to a same day full-service contraception clinic from February 1, 2016, to August 31, 2016. Patient volume, demographics of participants, type of contraceptive service provided, LARC initiation, and LARC removal rates were recorded prospectively. Outcomes were compared with the Student t-test or χ(2) test as appropriate.The mean age of participants seen in the first 6 months was 25 years; 70% of attendees were active duty women and 88% were enlisted service members. LARC initiation increased from 12% to 39%. Operation PINC is a cost savings initiative, saving the Navy a potential $15 million a year and 2.7 million lost person-hours by preventing unintended pregnancy.Offering same day contraceptive services is a potential cost savings, patient satisfier, which targets women at risk for unintended pregnancy, improves LARC initiation, and has the potential to improve operational readiness of female service members and ultimately decrease unintended pregnancy rates.",

    "articleAbstract": "Research has demonstrated the positive effects of exercise during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes, but very little research has evaluated the effect of pregnancy on women's fitness or the length of time needed to recover prepregnancy fitness after delivery. These questions are important in providing anticipatory guidance to women, from elite athletes to women who just want to know how their bodies will change after pregnancy. To women in the military, postpartum fitness is critically important because failing the mandatory biannual physical fitness assessment (PFA) can severely damage or prematurely end a woman's career. Therefore, understanding the expected changes in fitness, the timeline required to regain prepregnancy fitness levels after delivery, and understanding risk factors for physical fitness testing failure is an important aspect of obstetrical care in military populations. The Navy PFA is a unique opportunity to measure the effect of pregnancy on women's ability to perform a standardized fitness assessment. The objective of this research is to use data from the Navy PFA to compare fitness levels in individual women before and after pregnancy, and to identify individuals at risk for poor fitness levels and Physical Readiness Test (PRT) failure postpartum.A cohort of pregnant sailors stationed at Naval Medical Center San Diego in 2013 and 2014 was identified from Physical Readiness Information Management System. PFA results before pregnancy (PRE) were compared with results from the first postpartum PFA cycle (PP1) and second postpartum cycle (PP2). To evaluate risk factors for poor postpartum fitness levels, a nested case control was created including women who failed PP1 compared with women who passed.142 women were included in the cohort study and 99 women were included in the case control portion. Muscular strength was reduced postpartum; the mean number of sit-ups was 73.4 and 67.1 (p ≤ 0.001) and the mean number of push-ups was 38.5 and 35.2 (p = 0.002) prepregnancy and postpartum, respectively. Sixteen women failed PP1 compared with 5 women failing before pregnancy; odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (1.3, 10.5). Women who failed PP1 were significantly older compared with women who passed PP1, mean age 31.4 and 27.3 (p = 0.02); respectively. Significantly more women failing PP1 had a diagnosis of gestational diabetes OR 5.4 (1.1, 27.4) and anemia in pregnancy OR 11.9 (1.2, 164.5).At 6 months postpartum, active duty women have decreased muscular and cardiovascular fitness, and have not yet regained prepregnancy weight. These changes put women at high risk for failing the PFA. These changes resolve by the second postpartum PFA. Women above the age of 30 and those who develop gestational diabetes or anemia during pregnancy are at risk for poor postpartum fitness. The Navy should consider extending the time allowed for women to meet PFA standards postpartum and develop a program to monitor women's progress toward PFA standards and provide assistance as needed.",

    "articleAbstract": "Many differences between U.S. military beneficiaries and the U.S. general population, including differences in health care access, are known factors affecting invasive breast cancer outcomes. Thus, comparing the two populations for any outcome differences and their contributing factors may provide insights to breast cancer prognosis.Using a marginal Cox proportional hazards regression model, we compared disease-specific survival (DSS) and 5-year DSS rates between 418 patients from the Clinical Breast Care Project at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (CBCP-WR) and a set of 1:5 randomly matched patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Patients were compared in the \"demographic model\" (adjusted by diagnosis year, age, and race) and the \"overall model\" (further adjusted by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, stage, and grade).In the \"overall model,\" CBCP-WR patients were less likely overall to die from breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.631, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.437-0.911; p = 0.014). This increase in survival was also significant in African American patients (HR = 0.524, 95% CI = 0.277-0.992; p = 0.047) and patients older than 50 (HR = 0.511, 95% CI = 0.306-0.854; p = 0.010). The advantage in 5-year DSS rate for CBCP-WR patients was 5.3% (93.1% vs. 87.8%; p < 0.001) in the \"demographic model\" and 3.4% (91.3% vs. 87.9%; p = 0.018) in the \"overall model.\"CBCP-WR patients demonstrated significantly better DSS over matched SEER patients. Although a portion of the outcome disparity, i.e., 36% of the 5.3% DSS rate difference, could be explained by differences in tumor characteristics, the cause(s) behind the majority of the disparity has yet to be identified. Identification and further analysis of contributing factors to survival differences have the potential to improve clinical practice and outcomes for invasive breast cancer patients.",

    "articleAbstract": "Sea sickness may greatly impact the readiness of Service personnel deployed aboard naval vessels. Medications used in the treatment of sea sickness may have adverse effects, limiting their use as flight crew. Although the prevalence of sea sickness in flight crews remains unclear, individual susceptibility and high sea states are established risk factors. Literature review can guide optimized management strategies for this population.The first author conducted a PubMed search using the terms \"sea sickness\" \"flight crew\" \"scopolamine,\" \"hyoscine,\" and \"cinnarizine,\" identifying 15 articles of 350 matches, which addressed potential impact to flight performance. Analysis also included two historic reports about motion sickness maintained within the U.K. Army Aviation Centre's aeromedical archives in Middle Wallop, Hampshire. Both authors reviewed aeromedical policy for the International Civil Aviation Organization, U.K. Civil Aviation Authority, U.S. Federal Aviation Authority, the National Aeronautics Space Administration, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force.Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, has fewer operationally relevant side effects than cinnarizine or first-generation antihistamines. Although no aeromedical authorities endorse the unsupervised use of scopolamine, many will consider authorizing its temporary use following an initial assessment on the ground. Evidence supports the concomitant use of stimulant medication for augmenting antinausea effects and countering the potential sedative effects of scopolamine.Scopolamine should be considered as a first-line medication for flight crews at risk of sea sickness but such use must be guided by the appropriate aeromedical authority, ideally in conjunction with a ground trial to evaluate individual response. The limited evidence to support concurrent use of stimulants must be weighed against the challenges of maintaining accountability of controlled substances in the operational environment.",

    "articleAbstract": "Military-connected youth are at increased risk for experiencing distinct psychosocial and behavioral health vulnerabilities. Although behavioral health interventions have been developed to treat vulnerabilities in military-connected youth, little is known about the methodological quality of studies evaluating these interventions. In this study, a systematic review of behavioral health interventions for military-connected youth was conducted to examine methodological quality and treatment outcomes.Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies evaluating behavioral health interventions for military-connected youth which yielded 3,324 citations. Methodological quality was evaluated by 2 researchers with 3 measures that assessed scientific rigor, transparency, external and internal validity, and power for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method trials. Interrater reliability was strong (κ = 0.81). Sample characteristics and treatment outcomes were also assessed.Fourteen studies meeting full inclusion criteria evaluated 10 behavioral health interventions. Methodological quality scores for all studies were poor to fair, with limitations in reporting, external and internal validity, and power. Research designs were predominantly nonexperimental. Treatment effects for both psychosocial and behavioral health outcomes were consistently positive for all studies. In studies reporting effect sizes, treatment effects were small to moderate (d = 0.01-0.42, odds ratio = 0.04-0.47, b = -0.02-0.56). Demographic and military characteristics of samples were inconsistently reported.Behavioral health interventions for military-connected youth have noteworthy methodological limitations, indicating a need to employ more rigorous research strategies. Positive treatment outcomes, however, suggest promising interventions for improving psychosocial and behavioral health problems in military-connected youth. Future research directions and implications for clinical-community practice are also discussed.",

    "articleAbstract": "In the era of genetic engineering of pathogens, distinguishing unnatural epidemics from natural ones is a challenge. Successful identification of unnatural infectious disease events can assist in rapid response, which relies on a sensitive risk assessment tool used for the early detection of deliberate attacks (i.e., bioterrorism).A systematic review was conducted according to the outline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews. Published papers related to the detection of unnatural diseases were searched in MEDLINE (January 1927-April 2016), EMBASE (January 1937-March 2016), and Web of Science (January 1978-March 2016). Full texts were reviewed for the selection of studies on scoring systems specially designed to discern between unnatural and natural outbreaks.A total of 1,753 papers were reviewed, of which we identified the following five scoring systems specifically designed for detecting unnatural outbreaks: (1) the Grunow-Finke epidemiological assessment tool, (2) potential epidemiological clues to a deliberate epidemic, (3) bioterrorism risk assessment scoring, (4) and (5) two modified scoring systems based on (3). Various criteria ranging from the information on perpetrators, type of agents, spatial distribution, and intelligence of deliberate release were involved. Of these systems, the Grunow-Finke assessment tool remains the most widely used, but has low sensitivity for correctly identifying unnatural epidemics when tested against actual historical outbreaks. Others were applied into a few scenarios but provided different perspectives for bioterrorism detection and bio-preparedness.There are few risk assessment tools for differentiating unnatural from natural epidemics. These tools are increasingly necessary and valuable, but improved scoring systems with higher sensitivity, specificity, timeliness, and wider application to biological attacks must be developed.",

    "articleAbstract": "First-trimester vaginal bleeding is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department (ED). Many studies have looked at risk factors, evaluation, and treatment, but none have looked at the motivating factors for seeking care. The objective was to identify the most commonly held concerns by women experiencing first-trimester vaginal bleeding.A questionnaire was distributed to pregnant patients as they checked into the ED from January to July of 2013 with concern for first-trimester vaginal bleeding. Patients were instructed to rank a prepopulated list of reasons motivating their visit on the basis of level of importance. The study was given expedited approval by the Office of the Institutional Review Board.The most common reason behind a visit for vaginal bleeding in the first trimester was to have an ultrasound and blood work performed to evaluate the well-being of their fetus (41.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 34-50.1%]). The second most common reason, with a rate of 34% (CI 26.7-42.2%), was to simply know whether or not the patient was having a miscarriage, with no specific method of evaluation mentioned. A minority of patients ranked the potentially emergent conditions such as ectopic (3.5%), life-threatening hemorrhage (4.3%), or otherwise abnormal pregnancy (2.1%) as being their chief concern.First-trimester vaginal bleeding is a commonly encountered complaint in ED. Results obtained in this study reveal the largest proportion of patients surveyed expected an ultrasound and blood work and wanted to know by the end of the visit if she was having a miscarriage. This information gained from this study may be helpful to the emergency physician in managing expectations, catering to the patient's concerns, and may also be useful in boosting patient satisfaction.",

    "articleAbstract": "Recent system reforms within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have led to establishment of 5 theatre commands and a general joint logistics command. These reforms have presented new challenges to the organization and implementation of medical services. The medical service of the PLA must keep pace with these reforms by applying innovative theories to establish appropriate organizational guidelines and structures. The medical service must also adapt to the modern and future eras of information warfare.We review the existing structure and features of the military medical service of the PLA, highlighting issues related to ongoing reform within the PLA and the characteristics of modern and future information warfare. Reflection on current rules for medical evacuation and treatment of war-related injuries were made, and related organizational and structural innovations were proposed.Recent reforms and the characteristics of modern information warfare have rendered the current medical service and medical evacuation system of the PLA inefficient. The scale of the echelon configuration should be adjusted to establish a more focused, effective, and intelligent medical service. Resource allocation and general joint logistics should be optimized to establish a new well-rounded, three-dimensional medical evacuation system, and the \"stabilize before healing\" rule should be applied at all levels of the medical service. These changes should help to create a modern, effective, and responsive medical service within the PLA.This article explores how the military medical service of the PLA could adapt to system reform in order to implement efficient treatment of war injuries, reduce mortality and morbidity rates, and maintain combat readiness in the modern era of information warfare.",

    "articleAbstract": "There is evidence that immune system dysregulation and inflammation may play a role in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous studies have reported elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) in individuals with PTSD. However, it is unclear whether exacerbation of PTSD symptoms late in life is also associated with elevated inflammation. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the relationship between inflammation and late-life PTSD.We recruited veterans either diagnosed with PTSD after the age of 55 or with no diagnosis of PTSD. Six veterans did not meet all eligibility criteria, including five who did not meet criteria for PTSD and one with celiac disease. The final sample included a total of 32 male veterans (16 veterans diagnosed with PTSD after 55 and 16 veterans without PTSD). The groups were matched as closely as possible on age, body mass index, and combat exposure. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Inflammation was measured using serum CRP level.The two groups did not differ on sample characteristics including age, body mass index, tobacco use, medication use, and military history. CRP level was found to be significantly higher in the PTSD group than in the comparison group (Z = -3.047, p = 0.002), which was also observed after adjusting for depression scores (F(1, 27) = 8.30, p = 0.0077).The results from this pilot study suggest that late-life PTSD may be associated with increased inflammation. Further research in larger samples is needed to corroborate these findings and to clarify the relationship between inflammation and PTSD, which may lead to improved methods of diagnosis and treatment.",

    "articleAbstract": "The safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a 12-week structured exercise program targeting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women Veterans of childbearing age was tested in a pilot study.Thirty-one women Veterans of childbearing age were enrolled in the study, 22 remained eligible after the baseline assessment, and 16 completed the exercise protocol. The exercise program consisted of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (brisk walking), 4 times a week, for 12 weeks. Data were collected on duration, intensity, and side effects. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale was administered at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks. Weekly assessments provided data on PTSD and depression symptoms, pain, and quality of life.Both post-traumatic and depressive symptoms improved significantly by the end of study. There were no adverse events related to exercise. A small focus group provided subjective experiences supporting positive effects of exercise on emotion and physical health.The preliminary results of this study suggests that 12 weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise may be a promising intervention for PTSD in women Veterans of childbearing potential. Further controlled studies are warranted to determine efficacy of moderate intensity exercise as a treatment modality for this population.",

    "articleAbstract": "Training in literature appraisal and statistical interpretation is one of the residency training requirements outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Frequently, a journal club format is used to teach this competency although this teaching modality is not standardized or well studied in regard to its efficacy.This study sought to determine the effect of a structured journal club curriculum that incorporated The Lancet Handbook of Essential Concepts in Clinical Research on objective and self-assessed knowledge pertaining to study design and interpretation. The study was a retrospective observational study evaluating the effect of a structured journal club curriculum using the Lancet text with pre- and postimplementation assessment using a resident self-assessment survey. The study examined a monthly journal club curriculum that covered 1 topic/chapter from the assigned text, paired with a contemporary article to highlight the chapter topic. Resident self-assessed and objective knowledge was evaluated and compared using a survey taken before and after the curriculum change. The study was completed during 1 academic year at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington, an academic military medical training and tertiary care center. Study surveys were distributed to all 17 obstetrics and gynecology residents throughout the 4 residency training years. Of the 17 potential participants, 13 (76%) participated in the precurriculum assessment and 14 (82%) participated after its completion.There was no significant improvement in resident self-assessed knowledge following curriculum implementation. There was a trend toward improved objective knowledge pertaining to study design and interpretation after curriculum completion, but this was not statistically significant.There is a lack of standardized and well-studied methods to teach residents how to evaluate and appraise medical literature and research. The Lancet Handbook of Essential Concepts in Clinical Research may be a useful tool to teach some of these tenets in the residency training environment, but this limited study did not prove this assertion.Three is a dearth of proven and well-studied means to teach the tenets of study design, statistical interpretation, and critical literature appraisal to trainees with any consistency or validity. This study demonstrated a trend toward better objective knowledge related to study design, interpretation, and understanding after a change in our training curriculum that implemented The Lancet Handbook of Essential Concepts in Clinical Research into the monthly journal club curriculum. Resident self-rated knowledge and proficiency in their abilities to understand research and study design were not significantly changed with the curriculum.Better evidence is needed to guide future educational curricula directed toward teaching the competency of medical literature review and appraisal.",

    "articleAbstract": "Even moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy can pose risks to the fetus, making reliable and consistent detection of drinking in pregnancy critical. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) have shown some ability to detect lower levels of drinking, but the sensitivity of commercial EtG/EtS testing to lower levels of drinking among women of childbearing age is unknown. This study sought to determine the ability of an EtG/EtS algorithm, as well as EtG alone, to detect alcohol consumption in women of childbearing age using commercial testing and cutoffs.Ten women (ages 21-39 years of age) were administered one, two, or three standard drinks in separate sessions. Urinary EtG/EtS was measured at baseline and again at five timed intervals for 72 hours following each session. Samples from the first five participants used a commercial algorithm in which a positive test was EtG > 100 ng/ml and EtS > 25 ng/ml; samples from the next five participants were considered positive if only EtG was >100 ng/ml.All samples were positive at the 12-hour follow-up. By 24 hours, sensitivity for one standard drink was poor for the combined EtG/EtS assay as well as for EtG alone (20% detection) and modest for two standard drinks (40% detection). There were no positive EtG results after 36 hours.The EtG/EtS cutoffs used in the present study, which are representative of those used by commercial laboratories, were not sensitive enough to reliably detect light to moderate drinking beyond a 12-hour window among women of childbearing age.",

    "articleAbstract": "Latinos experience more severe pain relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Although pain is associated with alcohol use, little is known about pain/alcohol associations among Latinos. The current study examined whether emotion dysregulation explained associations between pain intensity/disability and alcohol use among Latinos in primary care.Participants were 252 low-income Latino adults (mean age = 38.7 years, SD = 10.8; 86.1% female; 95.2% reported Spanish as their first language) who completed self-report measures of pain, emotion dysregulation, and alcohol use.There was a significant indirect effect of pain intensity via emotion dysregulation in relation to alcohol use severity. In addition, there was a significant indirect effect of pain-related disability via emotion dysregulation in relation to alcohol use severity. Pain intensity and pain-related disability were each associated with emotion dysregulation, which in turn was associated with the severity of alcohol use. Effects were evident after controlling for sex, marital status, education, and years in the United States. Alternative models examined \"reverse\" indirect effects and were statistically rejected.Among Latinos in primary care, emotion dysregulation is a possible explanatory factor underlying pain and alcohol use associations.",

    "articleAbstract": "Numerous studies have modeled the effects of stress in the laboratory, demonstrating that smokers who are exposed to experimental stressors exhibit significant increases in acute psychological distress. Whether these stress reactions are predictive of stress-induced smoking during an actual quit attempt, however, has not been examined. Furthermore, the possibility that such effects are particularly strong among smokers with higher ambient levels of distress has not been addressed.Nicotine-dependent smokers (N = 60; 40 women, 20 men) completed the Brief Symptoms Index (BSI) and then participated in a laboratory stress task 1 week before a quit attempt. Acute psychological distress was measured immediately before and after exposure to stressful and neutral stimuli. After they quit, participants completed a smoking diary for 14 days in which they recorded the degree to which their smoking was precipitated by emotional stress.Consistent with our hypotheses, BSI scores predicted both exaggerated laboratory stress responses (p < .005) and smoking that was attributable to stress during the 14-day postquit period (p < .01). Laboratory stress reactions were predictive of stress-induced smoking (p < .01), and acute psychological stress reactions mediated the effects of BSI on stress-induced smoking.Acute psychological stress reactivity is a potential mechanism underlying the effect of stress-induced smoking during a quit attempt.",

    "articleAbstract": "The transition from high school to college is a unique developmental period to examine the relationship between social networks and alcohol use, because during this transition, students enter new environments and alcohol use becomes more pervasive. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which personal social networks change during this transition and to examine how changes in the composition of networks are related to alcohol use.Participants (N = 374, 57.8% female) reported on their alcohol use and provided information about individuals in their social network before and immediately after their first year of college. These network members were matched across the two observations and were classified as either carryover (i.e., named at both assessments), dropped (i.e., named at only the first assessment), or added (i.e., named at only the second assessment).We found robust turnover, such that only 22% of network members were retained from the first observation to the second. Furthermore, heavy drinking in high school was associated with retaining more friends during the transition to college, but once in college, adding more heavy drinkers as friends was associated with the greatest alcohol risk.These findings show how changes in the composition of the social network influence an individual's alcohol use during the transition to college. Results from this study could be used to improve interventions that address the composition of the social network as a whole, as well as the characteristics of each individual in their social network.",

    "articleAbstract": "Research on attentional biases to alcohol images has used heterogeneous sets of stimuli (e.g., an isolated beer can or a group of people drinking). However, alcoholic beverage preferences play an important part in determining an individual's alcohol use pattern and may influence attentional biases, especially for inexperienced drinkers. The current study examined whether alcoholic beverage preferences affect event-related potential (ERP) indices of cue reactivity to different types of alcohol images (e.g., beer, wine, and distilled spirits) in heavy episodic drinkers.ERPs were recorded in 14 heavy episodic drinkers (7 male) who completed a Go/No-Go task using preferred and nonpreferred alcohol images with nonalcoholic beverage images as controls.Larger N2 amplitudes for preferred alcohol images were observed relative to control images and to nonpreferred alcohol images, indicating increased attentional capture by preferred beverages. P3 amplitudes and latencies were not sensitive to preferences, but latencies were delayed and amplitudes were enhanced on No-Go trials (i.e., trials requiring response inhibition).These results suggest that alcoholic beverage preference is a factor influencing alcohol cue reactivity in heavy-episodic-drinking college students. This information has methodological significance and may also be applied to improve treatment and prevention programs that focus on attentional bias modification and inhibitory control training.",

    "articleAbstract": "Twitter data offer new possibilities for tracking health-related communications. This study is among the first to apply advanced information processing to identify geographic and content features of cannabis-related tweeting in the United States.Tweets were collected using streaming Application Programming Interface (March-May 2016) and were processed by eDrugTrends to identify geolocation and classify content by source (personal communication, media, retail) and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). States were grouped by cannabis legalization policies into \"recreational,\" \"medical, less restrictive,\" \"medical, more restrictive,\" and \"illegal.\" Permutation tests were performed to analyze differences among four groups in adjusted percentages of all tweets, unique users, personal communications only, and positive-to-negative sentiment ratios.About 30% of all 13,233,837 cannabis-related tweets had identifiable state-level geo-information. Among geolocated tweets, 76.2% were personal communications, 21.1% media, and 2.7% retail. About 71% of personal communication tweets expressed positive sentiment toward cannabis; 16% expressed negative sentiment. States in the recreational group had significantly greater average adjusted percentage of cannabis tweets (3.01%) compared with other groups. For personal communication tweets only, the recreational group (2.47%) was significantly greater than the medical, more restrictive (1.84%) and illegal (1.85%) groups. Similarly, the recreational group had significantly greater average positive-to-negative sentiment ratio (4.64) compared with the medical, more restrictive (4.15) and illegal (4.19) groups. Average adjusted percentages of unique users showed similar differences between recreational and other groups.States with less restrictive policies displayed greater cannabis-related tweeting and conveyed more positive sentiment. The study demonstrates the potential of Twitter data to become a valuable indicator of drug-related communications in the context of varying policy environments.",

    "articleAbstract": "In 2010, British Columbia introduced laws allowing police to suspend licenses and impound vehicles of drinking drivers based on roadside breath alcohol analysis results. This study examines regional variation in the effectiveness of the new laws and identifies local factors that may have modified the laws' effectiveness.First, we used an interrupted time series design with a negative binomial mixed model to study the change in rate of single-vehicle nighttime crashes (SVNCs; a proxy for alcohol-related crashes) in each of British Columbia's 118 police patrols after the laws were introduced. Next, the role of explanatory factors was studied using patrol-level estimated percent reduction in SVNCs as the response variable in a linear regression model with spatially autocorrelated errors that included explanatory factors as covariates.The average rate of SVNCs across police patrols was 12% lower (95% CI [9.1%, 14.8%]) following the new laws, and all police patrols included in our model had estimated reductions in SVNCs. Reductions in SVNCs were positively associated with the number of alcohol-serving establishments per capita and with socioeconomic status and were negatively associated with baseline rates of traffic citations.The laws were associated with improved road safety across the province but were least effective in more socioeconomically disadvantaged regions. Increased effectiveness in regions with more alcohol-serving establishments may have indicated a specific deterrent effect on drinking drivers who frequent these establishments. The laws were also more effective in regions with lower baseline traffic law enforcement (i.e., lower citation rates), perhaps because media reports about the immediate roadside penalties regime created unease in drinking drivers who previously knew that their risk of punishment for traffic law violations was low.",

    "articleAbstract": "The present study sought to inform models of risk for drugged driving through empirically identifying patterns of marijuana use, alcohol use, and related driving behaviors. Perceived dangerousness and consequences of drugged driving were evaluated as putative influences on risk patterns.We used latent profile analysis of survey responses from 897 college students to identify patterns of substance use and drugged driving. We tested the hypotheses that low perceived danger and low perceived likelihood of negative consequences of drugged driving would identify individuals with higher-risk patterns.Findings from the latent profile analysis indicated that a four-profile model provided the best model fit. Low-level engagers had low rates of substance use and drugged driving. Alcohol-centric engagers had higher rates of alcohol use but low rates of marijuana/simultaneous use and low rates of driving after substance use. Concurrent engagers had higher rates of marijuana and alcohol use, simultaneous use, and related driving behaviors, but marijuana-centric/simultaneous engagers had the highest rates of marijuana use, co-use, and related driving behaviors. Those with higher perceived danger of driving while high were more likely to be in the low-level, alcohol-centric, or concurrent engagers' profiles; individuals with higher perceived likelihood of consequences of driving while high were more likely to be in the low-level engagers group.Findings suggested that college students' perceived dangerousness of driving after using marijuana had greater influence on drugged driving behaviors than alcohol-related driving risk perceptions. These results support targeting marijuana-impaired driving risk perceptions in young adult intervention programs.",

We tested for differences associated with legal involvement and with client perceptions of coercion among individuals entering drug misuse treatment in England.Data collection involved 342 treatment agencies. Measures of motivation and readiness for treatment were taken from the Circumstances, Motivation, and Readiness (CMR) scale. Referral source was ordered to represent level of legal involvement and conditions. Perceived coercion was defined by a CMR item. Linear regression models, adjusting for client complexity, tested for differences in motivation and readiness by these measures.Levels of motivation and readiness did not differ according to level of legal conditions (coefficient = -0.38, 95% CI [-1.65, 0.88]). Motivation was inversely associated with perceived coercion (coefficient = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.05, -0.50], p = .014).At the point of treatment entry, criminal justice referral and aligned conditions have no impact on levels of motivation to achieve positive treatment outcomes. Concerns around lower levels of motivation are better focused on those who perceive themselves as coerced rather than on those whose referral carries a level of legal condition.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) significantly increases the likelihood of quit success at least over the short term, yet some smokers prematurely discontinue use. NRT side effects are often cited as the primary reason for medication discontinuation. The current study examined a theoretical pathway by which two smoking-related emotional vulnerabilities (anxiety sensitivity and emotion dysregulation) were related to the number of NRT (nicotine patch) side effects reported 1 week following a scheduled quit attempt. It was hypothesized that anxiety sensitivity would have an indirect effect on NRT side effects through emotion dysregulation.A total of 179 treatment-seeking, adult daily smokers with elevated anxiety sensitivity (47.5% male; M age = 39.73 years, SD = 13.87) were enrolled in a smoking cessation trial.Covariate-adjusted analyses provided support for the hypothesized pathway, such that emotion dysregulation explained the association between anxiety sensitivity and NRT side effects (b = 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [0.002, 0.03]; completely standardized estimate = .15).The findings underscore the importance of developing cessation treatments that incorporate techniques to enhance emotion regulation, particularly among smokers higher in anxiety sensitivity, to decrease the risk of NRT side effects.",

The economic impact of alcohol reduction using nalmefene treatment was not evaluated.The model simulates patient-level alcohol consumption over a 5-year time horizon across different treatment cohorts. Study outcomes included probabilities of alcohol-attributable diseases and injuries as well as deaths from these events. The approach used nalmefene clinical trial data, a time horizon of 1 and 5 years, and a U.K. societal perspective. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Compared with the PS strategy, NMF + PS was associated at Year 5 with a gain of 0.047 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an additional £503, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £10,613 per QALY gained. When compared with the strategy without treatment, NMF + PS was associated with a gain of 0.228 QALYs and an additional £1,795, leading to an ICER of £1,758 per QALY gained. The NMF + PS strategy dominated both treatment strategies when considering the U.K. societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.A combination of NMF and PS was better than PS alone, considering a 5-year time horizon and a societal perspective.",

    "articleAbstract": "Little is known regarding patterns of alcohol use and alcohol-related care among transgender adults. This study examined alcohol use and alcohol-related care across transgender status in a probability sample of U.S. adults.We conducted secondary analyses of the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, focusing on adults in eight states that administered both an Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention module and a Gender Identity module (n = 58,381). Measurements included transgender status, sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol consumption (any alcohol use, risky drinking, heavy episodic drinking, and any unhealthy alcohol use), and alcohol-related care (alcohol screening during healthcare visits and advice about unhealthy alcohol use). We tested the association between transgender status and alcohol consumption and alcohol-related care using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics.Approximately 0.6% of respondents (n = 283) self-identified as transgender. Overall, there were no significant differences in alcohol consumption or screening between transgender and nontransgender adults. A greater proportion of transgender than nontransgender adults reported being advised to reduce alcohol use (20.7% vs. 7.8%, p = .012). However, this difference was not significant after adjusting for other sociodemographic characteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.31, 95% CI [0.91, 5.86], p = .077).In this representative sample from eight U.S. states, we did not find differences related to transgender status in rates of alcohol use or of alcohol-related care.",

    "articleAbstract": "This study examined the prevalence and correlates of past-year alcohol initiation among young adolescents ages 12-14 and, among recent initiates, progression to current use, heavy episodic use, and alcohol use disorder (AUD).The 2004-2013 data from the annual cross-sectional National Survey of Drug Use and Health among 12- to 14-year-olds living in civilian U.S. households (n = 87,470) were used to estimate the prevalence and correlates of alcohol initiation.Lifetime prevalence of alcohol use was 19.9%; 14.1% reported past-year initiation. Among those with past-year initiation, 39.7% reported past-month use, 17.9% reported past-month heavy episodic use, and 10.4% met criteria for past-year AUD. Each alcohol estimate was higher among females than among males. Alcohol initiation increased with age; however, among past-year initiates, age was not associated with past-month use, heavy episodic use, or past-year AUD. In adjusted models, tobacco and illicit drug use were associated with each alcohol indicator tested; depression was associated with alcohol initiation and AUD among recent initiates.Progression from initiation to heavy episodic use and development of AUD happened rapidly for some young adolescents, including those who used other substances. Our results suggest the need for targeted clinical and public health efforts to prevent and reduce the burden of drinking and harmful drinking among this age group, especially among females, whose use and prevalence of use and misuse exceeded those of males.",

    "articleAbstract": "Per-capita alcohol consumption in Australia increased between 2001 and 2007 and has subsequently declined, particularly for young people over this period. We examine trends in general attitudes to alcohol and to perceptions of risk from alcohol consumption to assess whether consumption trends have been mirrored by changing ideas about alcohol. We also examine whether trends in attitudes vary across sociodemographic subgroups.Data are from the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (n = 127,916), 2001-2013. To examine trends in attitudes to alcohol and perceptions of risk related to alcohol, logistic regression was used to assess changes over time, with interaction analyses used to explore whether changing attitudes have been consistent across sociodemographic subgroups.There were statistically significant increases in the percentage of the population naming excessive alcohol consumption as the most serious drug problem in Australia (22.6% in 2001 to 43.6% in 2013, p < .001), naming alcohol as the drug that causes the most deaths (22.7% in 2001 to 34.2% in 2013, p < .001), and suggesting thresholds for low-risk drinking below two drinks per day for men (22.4% in 2001 to 33.0% in 2013, p < .001) and women (54.4% in 2001 to 64.8% in 2013, p < .001). These trends were consistent across all sociodemographic subgroups.Australian attitudes to alcohol became more conservative between 2001 and 2013. These trends may partly explain the decline in youth drinking observed over the same period, with young people's consumption potentially more likely to be affected by growing social concern about alcohol, although shifts in attitudes occurred even while consumption was increasing.",

    "articleAbstract": "Impulsivity and subjective response to alcohol are predictors of alcohol use disorder. The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend prior research examining relationships between impulsivity and subjective response patterns. In addition, impulsivity and initial subjective response patterns were examined in relation to current heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems.Data were cross-sectional, retrospective self-reports, obtained from baseline assessments from five studies affiliated with the Yale Center for the Translational Neuroscience of Alcoholism. Analyses were conducted in a sample restricted to nondependent, young adults (n = 186) and in a larger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 363). Data were analyzed using hierarchical regression in three separate types of models.In the young adult, nondependent sample, impulsivity was a statistically significant predictor of lower recent sedative subjective response. Impulsivity and initial sedative subjective response patterns were statistically significant predictors of past-year heavy drinking. Impulsivity, but not initial subjective response patterns, was a statistically significant predictor of past-year alcohol-related problems. Findings in the larger sample were similar.More-impulsive individuals may perceive less sedation from alcohol, which is associated with increased heavy drinking. However, higher levels of impulsivity may be more responsible than diminished subjective response for poor decision making that results in negative drinking consequences. These results suggest that high impulsivity and certain subjective response patterns are worthy intervention targets.",

    "articleAbstract": "Although substance use and problems among Mexican Americans are associated with both immigration to the United States and living at the U.S.-Mexico border, little is known about relationships between age at immigration and substance use by gender within the border context. The purpose of this study was to analyze the association of age at immigration with heavy alcohol use, alcohol use disorders (AUD), and drug use among Mexicans Americans living both on and off the U.S.-Mexico border.Household surveys were conducted, using area probability sampling of 2,336 Mexican Americans (1,185 female), ages 18-65, living at the Texas-Mexico border in the metropolitan areas of Laredo and McAllen/Brownsville, and in the nonborder location of San Antonio.Females immigrating before age 12 were less likely to report heavy alcohol use (odds ratio [OR] = 0.309), and those immigrating before age 21 were less likely to report any drug use during the last year compared with their U.S.-born counterparts (OR = 0.473; OR = 0.386, respectively). Males immigrating after age 20 were less likely to report heavy alcohol use (OR = 0.478), and those immigrating between ages 12 and 20 were less likely to report AUD (OR = 0.479) and drug use (OR = 0.255) compared with their U.S.-born counterparts. Early age at immigration (before age 12) was significantly associated with drug use for males living on the border compared with those living off the border.Findings suggest that among females, immigrating before age 12 (vs. being born in the United States) is protective against heavy alcohol and drug use, but among males, immigrating before age 12 results in similarly heavy patterns of use as their U.S.-born counterparts, partially supporting previous findings that early immigration is particularly risky in relation to substance use and AUD.",

    "articleAbstract": "Social relationships, such as committed partnerships, limit risky behaviors like heavy drinking, in part, because of increased social control. The current analyses examine whether involvement in committed relationships or social support extend beyond a main effect to limit genetic liability in heavy drinking (gene-environment interaction) during young adulthood.Using data from the young adult wave of the Finnish Twin Study, FinnTwin12 (n = 3,269), we tested whether involvement in romantic partnerships or social support moderated genetic influences on heavy drinking using biometric twin modeling for gene-environment interaction.Involvement in a romantic partnership was associated with a decline in genetic variance in both males and females, although the overall magnitude of genetic influence was greater in males. Sex differences emerged for social support: increased social support was associated with increased genetic influence for females and reduced genetic influence for males.These findings demonstrate that social relationships are important moderators of genetic influences on young adult alcohol use. Mechanisms of social control that are important in limiting genetic liability during adolescence extend into young adulthood. In addition, although some relationships limit genetic liability equally, others, such as extensive social networks, may operate differently across sex.",

    "articleAbstract": "Reducing drug-involved driving is a national policy priority, but little is known about the extent to which drivers receive warnings about the impairment potential of their prescribed medications. We used data from the 2013-2014 National Roadside Survey (NRS) to quantify the proportion of drivers who received warnings regarding potentially impairing medications and the association with driving-related risk perceptions.Drivers randomly selected at 60 sites completed the self-administered survey, which contained questions on their use of prescription medications.Overall, 7,405 drivers completed the prescription drug portion of the NRS. Of these, 19.7% reported recent use (within the past 2 days) of a potentially impairing prescription drug, and 78.2% said the drug had been prescribed for their use. Users of prescribed sedatives (85.8%) and narcotics (85.1%) were most likely to report receiving information about potential impairment, compared with only 57.7% and 62.6% of users of prescribed stimulant and antidepressant medications, respectively. Receipt of warnings varied by sex, race/ethnicity, income, geographic region, and time of day. For a majority of drug categories, drivers who reported receiving warnings had significantly higher odds of perceived risk of impaired driving/crash and criminal justice involvement.Most users of prescription medications reported that the drug was prescribed for their use, but not all reported receiving warnings about driving impairment. Our study provides evidence of missed opportunities for information provision on impaired driving, identifies subgroups that may warrant enhanced interventions, and provides preliminary evidence that receipt of impairment warnings is associated with increased perceptions of driving-related risk.",

    "articleAbstract": "Milk is an important and beneficial food from a nutritional point of view, being an indispensable source of high quality proteins. Furthermore, it is a raw material for many dairy products, such as yoghurt, cheese, cream etc. Before reaching consumers, milk goes through production, processing and circulation. Each step involves potentially unsafe factors, such as chemical contamination that can affect milk quality. Antibiotics are widely used in veterinary medicine for dry cow therapy and mastitis treatment in lactating cows, which can cause the presence of antimicrobial residues in milk. In order to ensure consumers' safety, milk is analyzed to make sure that the fixed Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for antibiotics are not exceeded. Multiclass methods can monitor more drug classes through a single analysis, so they are faster, less time-consuming and cheaper than traditional methods (single-class); this aspect is particularly important for milk, which is a highly perishable food. Nevertheless, multiclass methods for veterinary drug residues in foodstuffs are real analytical challenges. This article reviews the major multiclass methods published for the determination of antibiotic residues in milk by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, with a special focus on sample preparation approaches.",

    "articleAbstract": "A total diet study (TDS) provides representative and realistic data for assessing the dietary intake of chemicals, such as contaminants and residues, and nutrients, at a population level. Reproducing the diet through collection of customarily consumed foods and their preparation as habitually eaten is crucial to ensure representativeness, i.e., all relevant foods are included and all potential dietary sources of the substances investigated are captured. Having this in mind, a conceptual framework for building a relevant food-shopping list was developed as a research task in the European Union's 7th Framework Program project, 'Total Diet Study Exposure' (TDS-Exposure), aimed at standardising methods for food sampling, analyses, exposure assessment calculations and modelling, priority foods, and selection of chemical contaminants. A stepwise approach following the knowledge translation (KT) model for concept analysis is proposed to set up a general protocol for the collection of food products in a TDS in terms of steps (characterisation of the food list, development of the food-shopping list, food products collection) and pillars (background documentation, procedures, and tools). A simple model for structuring the information in a way to support the implementation of the process, by presenting relevant datasets, forms to store inherent information, and folders to record the results is also proposed. Reproducibility of the process and possibility to exploit the gathered information are two main features of such a system for future applications.",

    "articleAbstract": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is commonly performed in patients who can pose technical challenges, such as obesity, prior surgery, and subsequent incisional hernias. A new technique, the subcostal trocar approach using four 5-mm with exclusive removal (STAUFFER) LC, was developed to diminish these impediments and is highly advantageous.A retrospective review was performed of medical records for 389 patients who underwent LC from June 2011 through December 2016. STAUFFER LC involves (1) steep patient positioning, (2) visualized 5-mm trocar entry in the right abdomen, (3) use of three additional right subcostal trocars, and (4) gallbladder extraction from the high right lateral trocar site. Patient characteristics, operative details, and outcomes were analyzed and compared.STAUFFER LC was used in 255 patients (65.6%), and standard four-trocar LC (SLC) was performed in 134 patients (34.4%). Overall indications for surgery included chronic cholecystitis (71.7%), acute cholecystitis (19.8%), polyp (2.3%), and other (5.9%). No significant differences were detected in comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification between the two patient groups. More patients in the STAUFFER LC group had previous midline abdominal surgery (P = .06) and significantly higher body mass index (P = .03), and they required less operative time (P < .001). No patient had an entry site injury. No significant difference was noted in morbidity. One patient required a second laparoscopic operation for bleeding. One patient with Crohn's disease and \"hostile abdomen\" had an enterocutaneous fistula that closed spontaneously. In the SLC group, trocar site hernia (TSH) developed in 3 patients.STAUFFER LC is widely applicable and effective, saving operative time and reducing the risk of TSH. It is especially advantageous for obese patients who have had previous surgery.",

    "articleAbstract": "Ovarian cysts are a common finding in reproductive-aged females. Most of them are functional cysts that typically resolve spontaneously and require no treatment. However, ovarian cysts may also be adverse events associated with inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Both approved mTOR inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus are widely used as immunosuppressive agents after organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of mTOR inhibitors vs. non-mTOR inhibitor immunosuppression on the incidence, size and complication rate of ovarian cysts in renal transplant recipients.We retrospectively analysed 571 consecutive female kidney transplant patients in our centre between 2000 and 2008. The follow-up period was extended through December 31st, 2012.102 (17.8%) patients received mTOR inhibitors for at least one month after transplantation. We identified 44 women (7.7%) with new ovarian cysts. Ovarian cysts were significantly more frequent among patients receiving mTOR inhibitors (20.5%) than in the control group (4.9%; p < 0.001). Also the hospitalization rate was higher (p = 0.05) in the mTOR group and ten patients (47.6%) requiring surgery.Future prospective studies are required to determine the underlying cause of ovarian toxicity and treatment strategies have to be developed in order to avoid severe complications.",

The study population was divided into three groups, based on age (<6years, 6-12 years, >12 years). One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of \"age group\" on duration of treatment, post-recovery time, treatment procedures and utilization of different restorative materials. Kappa statistics were used for intra-examiner reliability.A total of 275 patients (174 males and 101 females) were included in the study. The mean age of the patients at the time they received GA was 12.37±10.18 years. Dental procedures performed were mostly restorative in nature (47%). The >12 years group had significantly shorter treatment duration (p<0.05). No significant difference in post-operative recovery time was observed among the three age groups (p>0.05). The <6 years group received significantly less preventive, but more restorative procedures (p<0.05). Significantly fewer extractions were performed in the 6-12 years group (p<0.05). The use of composite restorations was significantly higher in the <6 years group; while amalgam restorations were more frequently used in the >12 years group (P<0.05). Stainless steel crowns were more frequently employed in SNP under 12 years of age (p<0.05). Intra-examiner reliability was good (k=0.94).Most of the dental procedures performed under GA on SNP were restorative procedures. For children less than 6 years of age, had longer treatment time under GA. Composite restorations and stainless steel crowns were more frequently used in the primary dentition and amalgam restorations were more frequently employed in the permanent dentition.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate if there is a difference in MPM between the right and left hand.Two hundred fifty-four patients were obtained from the Complex Operating Unit of Orthodontics of Padua University Hospital. The total sample size has been selected by appropriate statistical calculations resulting in 130 patients. It was decided to further double the sample size of a previous study to ensure a robust statistical analysis. Radiographs of the right and left were obtained using the MPM method. Stages were compared using the right hand as a reference. The statistical analysis (Fisher exact test) was performed for the entire sample and related to gender in order to compare the right and the left hand stages.In MPS2, 6 out 49 (12.2%) males and 7 out 27 females (25.9%) showed MPS3 in the left hand (p-value < 0.05). In all other stages, a total agreement (100%) was found.The authors confirm the use of the right hand as reference. In patients with MPS2 an additional radiograph on the left hand can be taken in order to increase the diagnostic accuracy. In all other stages other radiographs are not needed as a total agreement between the right and left hand was found.",

Research on vulnerable populations, such as children, is necessary but only admissible when researchers strictly follow methodological and ethical standards, together with the respect to human rights; and very especially when the investigation cannot be conducted with other population or when the potential benefits are specifically for that age group. Clinical research in Pediatric Dentistry is not an exception. The aim of the present article was to provide the bioethical principles (with respect to the child/parents' autonomy, benefit/risk analysis, and distributive justice), and recommendations, including informed consent, research ethics committees, conflict of interest, and the \"equipoise\" concept. Current and future worldwide oral health research in children and adolescents must be conducted incorporating their perspectives in the decision-making process as completely as possible. This concept must be carefully considered when a dental clinical study research is going to be planned and conducted, especially in the case of randomized controlled trials, in which children will be recruited as participants.",

The differences in prevalence of AP by gender, ethnicity, dentition and homologous sites at both sides of the mouth were not statistically significant (Chi square). AP was mostly diagnosed at the distal area of the maxillary canine, the proximal areas of the first maxillary primary molars, and the distal area of the mandibular first primary molar. The most affected teeth with AP were the first primary molars followed by the maxillary cuspid, and the second molars.Examination of children's primary teeth should include abnormal mobility, when found it should be followed by radiographic evaluation for the presence of AP, taking in consideration the present findings.",

    "articleAbstract": "Due to the low prevalence of localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP), clinical characteristics of LAP in primary dentition are derived from a few case reports/series in the literature. The goal of this study was to determine common clinical characteristics such as bone and root resorption patterns, in a series of cases with LAP in primary dentition. We hypothesize these cases present aggressive periodontal bone destruction starting mostly around first primary molars and atypical root resorption patterns.We have evaluated 33 LAP cases in primary dentition for pattern of bone destruction, root resorption and early exfoliation.Cases evaluated were aged 5-12 (mean=8.7 years). Thirty cases presented more severe bone loss on first than second molars, with relatively fast progression to second molars, altered pattern of root resorption, mostly external (n=16) and early exfoliation of primary teeth due to periodontal bone loss, rather than physiologic root resorption (n=11).This study showed common clinical characteristics found in LAP in primary molars, including possible initiation on first primary molars and abnormal root resorption patterns. These characteristics are important to be early identified and treated in order to prevent possible progression into the permanent dentition.",

    "articleAbstract": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the apical extrusion of irrigant and depth of irrigant penetration into the dentinal tubules using the EndoVac irrigating system and the manual irrigation system in primary molar teeth.Twenty five extracted primary molars satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into two groups of 29 roots in each group with an equal distribution of apical foramen area. The teeth were mounted in pre-weighed glass bottles and the canals were irrigated with both the irrigating systems using 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution mixed with acid fuchsin which enables the irrigating solution to penetrate efficiently into the dentinal tubules. The amount of irrigant extruded was recorded. The roots were sectioned at 2mm, 4mm and 6mm from the apex and examine the depth of irrigant penetration into the dentinal tubules under a stereomicroscope.Apical extrusion of the irrigant was significantly less with the EndoVac system (1.18±1.04gms) when compared to manual irrigation system (2.3±1.55gms) (P<0.05). EndoVac irrigation system showed greater depth of irrigant penetration into the dentinal tubules (49.90±17.52mm, 32.17±12.20mm and 15.70±8.91mm) compared to the manual irrigation system (30.48±16.27mm, 14.74±9.67mm and 5.59±7.09mm) at 6mm, 4mm and 2mm respectively (P<0.05). Results showed that the depth of irrigant penetration into the dentinal tubules with both the irrigating systems was found to be significantly greater in the six mm sections compared to the four mm and two mm sections (P<0.05).The EndoVac irrigation system showed significantly greater efficacy compared to the manual irrigation system in primary molars with less amount of irrigant extrusion and better depth of irrigant penetration into the dentinal tubules.",

Ten teeth with root canals filled with sterile saline were the control group. Microtensile fracture strength was measured in Mechanical tester Lloyd testing machine.There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the fracture strength of the calcium hydroxide-filled teeth after 90 days (19.1 MPa) compared with the control (35.8 MPa). Dentin microtensile fracture strength of the calcium hydroxide-filled teeth decreased at an average of 0.142 MPa per day.Calcium hydroxide placed in root canals for an extended time had a significantly negative effect on root strength. Long-term success of root canal treatment in primary anterior teeth is estimated as 65% with most of the failures result from trauma recurrence.Our results stress the need to evaluate the pros and cons of root canal treatment compared to extractions of non-vital primary incisors.",

Potassium and Selenium though present in appreciable amounts did not show any significant difference between the two groups (p-value>0.05).In caries free subjects, copper and fluoride levels were significantly higher while the level of lead was lower as compared to caries-active children. Potassium and selenium did not show any significant differences within the two groups.",

The data were analyzed using the mixed-methods: qualitative (metaphor analysis) and quantitative (chi-square) data analysis techniques.The dentists and DSs produced 259 metaphors. These metaphors were gathered under six different conceptual categories that define a PDP as unpredictable, dangerous, uncontrollable, requiring care and sensitivity, valuable, and orientable. The most important factors leading to these conceptions were the uncooperativeness of some PDPs and the effectiveness of behavior management.The results of this study indicate that there was no significant difference among DSs, general dentists and specialist dentists with respect to six conceptual categories that identify the conceptions about PDPs.",

Sociodemographic and health data were collected from their mothers using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression modelling for DDE prevalence and negative binomial regression modelling for the extent of DDE.The prevalence of any enamel defects was 64.0% (95% Confidence Interval: 61.4, 67.0); the main types were diffuse opacities (35.0%), demarcated opacities (29.5%) and hypoplasia (3.7%). In general, older children had a lower prevalence and extent of enamel defects than their counterparts (p<0.001). There were no other significant associations.Enamel defects are common, especially among younger children, but the role of pre-, peri- and postnatal exposures remains unclear.",

This study was constructed to investigate the presence of 16 PAHs in six commonly consumed vegetables collected from the markets in Shandong, China by a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe (QuEChERS)-based extraction method coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results showed that the vegetables were polluted with PAHs at an alarming level, of which celery contained the highest total concentration of PAHs (Σ16 PAH), whereas cucumbers contained the lowest Σ16 PAH. Besides, the dietary exposure of PAHs was assessed in these vegetables based on the maximum Σ16 PAH. The results showed that the populations in Shandong were exposed to 23-213 ng/d of PAHs through these six vegetables, suggesting that vegetables are the major sources of PAHs in the diet. Hence, it is necessary to monitor the PAH levels in vegetables. Our study provides guidance for future legislative actions regarding PAH levels in vegetables in China.",

During 2015 to 2016, a total of 51 Arabica (Coffea arabica) coffee samples from Benguet province and 71 Robusta (Coffea canephora var. Robusta) coffee samples from the provinces of Ifugao and Kalinga were analysed for OTA contamination. The OTA-producing fungal contaminants during drying and storage of Arabica and Robusta coffee were Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus ochraceus. Ochratoxin A was more commonly detected in Robusta coffee (36.6%) than in Arabica coffee (21.6%). Among the contaminated samples, Robusta coffee cherries in the drying yard had the highest mean OTA level (120.2 μg kg(-1), n = 10) while roasted Robusta coffee beans had the lowest mean level (4.8 μg kg(-1), n = 9). The onset of contamination of Arabica coffee occurred during storage, with a mean OTA level of 46.7 μg kg(-1) (n = 9). Roasted coffee had lower OTA content although five samples had levels >5.0 μg kg(-1). Pearson Chi-square analysis (χ(2)) and Fisher's exact test revealed that several post-harvest practices involving non-removal of the husk or hull and mixing of defective coffee were significantly associated with the occurrence of OTA during drying and storage (p < 0.05). No significant associations, however, were identified during roasting. This study suggests that the post-harvest practices in Cordillera Administrative Region should focus on the removal of defective coffee in all stages of post-harvest and rapid reduction of moisture content particularly during drying.",

Unfortunately, in some of these cases idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity have been documented in a minority of patients. This review aims to tackle the problem of benzopyrone (particularly coumarin) toxicity by considering their metabolic pathways and identifying relevant alleles needed to take a targeted pharmacogenetic approach in its future use.The nontoxic 7-hydroxylation and the toxic heterocyclic \"ring-splitting\" epoxidation pathways are the two main detoxification pathways in the hepatometabolism of coumarin, the former catalyzed by CYP2A6 and the latter by possibly CYP1A and CYP2E. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) clears toxic aldehyde intermediates. CYP2A6 polymorphism screening methods, including genotyping, by real-time polymerase chain reaction and chromatography-mass spectroscopy functional metabolite assays; efficiency of these techniques are continually improving. ALDH polymorphisms have also been implicated, with clinically viable screening tests, rapid genotyping, and sensitive questionnaires already available for ALDH2*1/ALDH2*2. Dysfunctional polymorphisms of the above genes and others are significantly more prevalent in Eastern Asian populations, uncommon in Caucasian populations. The role of other enzymes/genes in the pathway is yet to be clarified.Although screening techniques are becoming increasingly clinically feasible, uncertainty remains on the link between the genotype, metabolic phenotype, and the exact gene products involved. These must be elucidated further before a targeted pharmacogenomic approach is fully viable. In the meantime, treatment should be avoided in those with vulnerable familial and ethnic descents if used.",

    "articleAbstract": "The positive effects of caffeine ingestion on aerobic performance are well-established; however, recent findings are suggesting that caffeine ingestion might also enhance components of anaerobic performance. A commonly used test of anaerobic performance and power output is the 30-second Wingate test. Several studies explored the effects of caffeine ingestion on Wingate performance, with equivocal findings. To elucidate this topic, this paper aims to determine the effects of caffeine ingestion on Wingate performance using meta-analytic statistical techniques. Following a search through PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and SportDiscus(®), 16 studies were found meeting the inclusion criteria (pooled number of participants = 246). Random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) for peak power output and mean power output was performed. Study quality was assessed using the modified version of the PEDro checklist. Results of the meta-analysis indicated a significant difference (p = .005) between the placebo and caffeine trials on mean power output with SMD values of small magnitude (0.18; 95% confidence interval: 0.05, 0.31; +3%). The meta-analysis performed for peak power output indicated a significant difference (p = .006) between the placebo and caffeine trials (SMD = 0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.47 [moderate magnitude]; +4%). The results from the PEDro checklist indicated that, in general, studies are of good and excellent methodological quality. This meta-analysis adds on to the current body of evidence showing that caffeine ingestion can also enhance components of anaerobic performance. The results presented herein may be helpful for developing more efficient evidence-based recommendations regarding caffeine supplementation.",

    "articleAbstract": "This study examined agreement between self-perceived sleep and sleep estimated via activity monitors in professional rugby league athletes. 63 athletes, from three separate teams wore actigraphy monitors for 10.3 ± 3.9 days. During the monitoring period, ratings of perceived sleep quality (on a 1-5 and 1-10 Likert scale), and an estimate of sleep duration were recorded daily. Agreement between sleep estimated via activity monitors and self-perceived sleep was examined using mean bias, Pearson correlation (r) and typical error of the estimate (TEE). 641 nights of sleep were recorded, with a very large, positive correlation observed between sleep duration estimated via activity monitors and subjective sleep duration (r = 0.85), and a TEE of 48 minutes. Mean bias revealed subjective sleep duration overestimated sleep by an average of 19.8 minutes. The relationship between sleep efficiency estimated via activity monitors and self-perceived sleep quality on a 1-5 (r = 0.22) and 1-10 Likert scale (r = 0.28) was limited. The outcomes of this investigation support the use of subjective measures to monitor sleep duration in rugby league athletes when objective means are unavailable. However, practitioners should be aware of the tendency of athletes to overestimate sleep duration.",

    "articleAbstract": "An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated (in-house) for the quantification of selected brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), tetrabromobisphenol S (TBBPS) and bromophenols (BPs), in various food matrices. The sample preparation consisted of extraction of TBBPS with acidified acetonitrile followed by a fast dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE) clean-up and extraction of the other BFRs with a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) with subsequent clean-up using acidified silica (44%, w/w). The limits of quantification of the method varied widely for the types of food matrices and the different classes of BFRs from 4 pg g(-1) wet weight (ww) to 8 ng g(-1) ww. For most of the analytes the apparent recovery was in the range 70-120%, and the method precision (under repeatability conditions) was below 20%. The method was successfully applied in proficiency testing exercises as well as for analysis of various food items. Only 25% of the collected food samples contained BFRs, with 4-bromophenol and α-HBCD as the only detected compounds. The contaminated foodstuffs were fish and eggs with concentrations in the range from 48 to 305 pg g(-1) ww.",

    "articleAbstract": "Glioblastoma remains one of the most common central nervous system tumors with an extremely poor prognosis. Recently, rapid progress in immunotherapy has provided new options for the treatment of glioblastoma. Vaccination, the primary method of immunotherapy, stimulates the body's tumor-specific immune response by the injection of foreign antigens. Peptide vaccines involve the injection of tumor-specific antigens, such as EGFRvIII or heat-shock proteins. Cell-based vaccines, which primarily include dendritic cell vaccines and tumor cell vaccines, involve injections of ex vivo-modified cells. Despite the encouraging results of phase I/II clinical trials, no successful phase III clinical trials involving glioblastoma immunotherapy, including glioblastoma vaccinations, have been reported to date. In this review, the authors summarize the published outcomes of glioblastoma vaccine therapy, explore its future prospects based on ongoing clinical trials, and discuss combined therapy as a future direction for glioblastoma treatment.",

    "articleAbstract": "Prior to availability of an effective vaccine, an estimated 4 million cases of varicella occurred annually in the United States, resulting in 10,000 hospitalizations and over 100 deaths.  With the increased usage of a two-dose varicella vaccine (as recommended by the ACIP), approval of other VZV-containing products and the adoption of varicella vaccination in additional countries, the demand for VZV-containing vaccines has increased. This study (NCT02062502) evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of VARIVAX™ (VAR, varicella vaccine live) manufactured using a new seed manufacturing process (VARNSP) compared to the currently licensed VAR. Healthy children 12-23 months were randomized (1:1) into Group 1 (2 doses of VARNSP given concomitantly with M-M-R™ II, ∼3 months apart) versus  Group 2 (2 doses of VAR given concomitantly with M-M-R™ II, ∼3 months apart).  Serum samples collected prior to vaccination on Day 1 and 6 weeks Postdose 1 were tested for antibody to VZV using a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA).  Safety was assessed Days 1 to 42 following each vaccination. Six weeks Postdose 1, the response rate (percent of subjects with VZV antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/mL) of VARNSP was non-inferior compared to VAR.  Vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) were comparable with the exception of measles-like rash, where a greater number of rashes were observed with VAR than VARNSP.  The 2 vaccination groups were comparable with incidence rates of AEs, injection-site AEs, vaccine-related AEs, systemic AEs, and serious AEs. This new process is an important innovation for the extreme demand of sustaining sufficient supplies of varicella vaccine to protect our communities against diseases caused by VZV.",

    "articleAbstract": "The oxidation of Winery Wastewater (WW) by conventional aerobic biological treatment usually leads to inefficient results due to the presence of organic substances, which are recalcitrant or toxic in conventional procedures. This study explores the combination of biological and chemical processes in order to complete the oxidation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable compounds in two sequential steps. Thus, a biological oxidation of a diluted WW is carried out by using the activated sludge process. Activated sludge was gradually acclimated to the Diluted Winery Wastewater (DWW). Some aspects concerning the biological process were evaluated (kinetics of the oxidation and sedimentation of the sludge produced). The biological treatment of the DWW led to a 40-50% of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal in 8 h, being necessary the application of an additional process. Different chemical processes combining UVA-LEDs radiation, monoperoxysulfate (MPS) and photocatalysts were applied in order to complete the COD depletion and efficient removal of polyphenols content, poorly oxidized in the previous biological step. From the options tested, the combination of UVA, MPS and a novel LaCoO3-TiO2 composite, with double route of MPS decomposition through heterogeneous catalysis and photocatalysis, led to the best results (95% of polyphenol degradation, and additional 60% of COD removal). Initial MPS concentration and pH effect in this process were assessed.",

    "articleAbstract": "Studies show disparities in maternal health behaviors according to acculturation, but whether paternal factors influence these patterns is unknown. We assessed the relationships between fathers' ethnicity and place of birth with maternal smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding initiation overall and for 30 major ethnic groups.Data were from the Standard Certificate of Live Births on 1,053,096 births in Massachusetts between 1996 through 2010. We examined the concordance of maternal and paternal ethnicity and place of birth across three categories (United States-born white, United States-born Other ethnicity, and foreign-born), and then in relation to maternal smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding initiation. Multivariable models adjusted for maternal age, marital status, education, plurality, parity, prenatal care, delivery source of payment, and year of birth.United States-born white mothers were less likely to smoke during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60, 0.73) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (AOR 1.56; 95% CI: 1.46, 1.66) if their partners were foreign-born. In contrast, foreign-born mothers whose partners were United States-born of Other ethnicity or United States-born white had a 1.65-5.12 higher odds of smoking during pregnancy and were 26%-41% less likely (AORs 0.59-0.74) to initiate breastfeeding than if their partners were also foreign-born. Results were consistent across most racial/ethnic groups.Our findings offer new insight into the social pathways by which acculturation impacts maternal health behaviors and add to growing evidence that fathers are valuable to maternal health. Future efforts to understand how acculturation results in poorer maternal health behaviors should account for paternal influences.",

    "articleAbstract": "We previously reported that local subcutaneous echo-free space (SEFS) in the leg was stirringly correlated with extracellular fluid (ECF) status in the same part of the leg when assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). In this study, we examined whether local SEFS represents the ECF status in the entire limb.In 51 legs and 40 arms with lymphedema (LE), subcutaneous tissue ultrasonography was performed to determine SEFS severity (range, 0-2). BIA was also performed to calculate the L-Dex(®) score (LDS), which is a BIA-derived parameter to represent ECF status, for the arm and modified LDS (mLDS) for the leg (the right arm was used as a reference instead of the contralateral leg). SEFS severity in any part of the leg showed good correlation with mLDS, but that in the lateral lower calf showed the strongest correlation (ρ = 0.86). In contrast, only SEFS severity in the medial forearm showed good correlation with LDS (ρ = 0.74).Local SEFS may represent ECF status in the entire limb in both the leg and arm LE.",

    "articleAbstract": "Manure amendment in agricultural practice can have a large effect on herbicide dissipation because the period of manure plowing is close to the period of herbicide application. In addition, manure amendment is among the frequently encountered options in ameliorating pesticide pollution. In this research, the dissipation of the herbicide pendimethalin was examined after amendment with two common green manures, Lupinus luteus (L) or Cosmos bipinnatus (C), for 110 days in pH 5.2 and 7.7 soils (Sankengtzu [Sk] and Erhlin [Eh] soil, respectively). The microbial activity and ecology changes were examined by using Biolog EcoPlate and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In Sk soil, the half-lives of pendimethalin with L, C, and blank treatment were 49.0, 54.9, and 62.2 days, respectively, whereas that in Eh soil they were 46.3, 52.6, and 34.8 days, respectively. Pendimethalin dissipated quickly in more neutral soil (Eh soil), but the addition of manure can only increase the dissipation rate in acidic soil (Sk soil), indicating that the amendment of manures exerted different effect in pendimethalin dissipation rates in different pH soils. The application of pendimethalin and/or manure altered the microbial community activity after 24 h of incubation. After 110 days, the microbial community activities in green manure-amended soil were more similar to that with blank than pendimethalin treatment in both types of soils. In comparison with treatment C, microbial communities were more similar between treatment L and blank, indicating the superior effect over pendimethalin on microbial communities when applying Lupinus luteus. The research showed that the application of herbicide pendimethalin changed soil microbial community, and the amendment of manures exerted different effect in pendimethalin dissipation rates in different pH soils. It is assumed that the change in dissipation rates was originated from the microbial community change after different manure amendment.",

Integrins are type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins located on the cell surface, widely expressed in leukocytes, which play an important role in the inflammatory pathway. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of anti-integrin therapy and to assess ongoing clinical trials in ocular disease. We performed a search on PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase for the published literature available using the MeSH terms: \"integrin therapy\" and \"αLβ2,\" \"α4β1\" and \"α4β7,\" \"αvβ3,\" \"αvβ5,\" and \"αvβ1\" and/or \"ophthalmology,\" and \"clinical trials.\" We used no language restrictions. We generated searches to account for synonyms of these keywords and MESH headings as follows: (1) \"integrin,\" \"therapy,\" or \"treatment\"; (2) \"clinical trials,\" \"ophthalmology,\" or \"ocular.\" In addition, the analysis included phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials with a minimal follow-up of six months. Integrin antagonists have shown their capacity to improve signs and symptoms of patients with dry eye disease, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and vitreomacular traction.",

In a recent publication, we described the development of an ex vivo enteroid-macrophage co-culture model using human primary cells. We reported that macrophages residing underneath the epithelial monolayer acquired \"resident macrophage\" phenotype characterized by lower production of inflammatory cytokines and strong phagocytic activity. These macrophages extended projections across the epithelium, which captured ETEC applied to the apical side of the epithelium and reduced luminal bacterial load. Additional evidence presented in this addendum confirms these findings and further demonstrates that macrophage adaptation occurs regardless of the stage of differentiation of epithelial cells, and that ETEC uptake arises rapidly after infection. The enteroid-macrophage co-culture represents a novel and relevant tool to study host-cell interactions and pathogenesis of enteric infections in humans.",

In this article, we describe a fast, repeatable, low-cost technique to detect bar edge and stabilizers.A perioperative scan is performed by means of a portable ultrasonograph a few minutes before the operation. The bar edge stabilizer is detected as a hyperechogenic image with a concentric crescent while the bar edge is detected as a hyperechogenic dashed line with net edges. The scan is performed, and the actual projection on the skin of the metal plaque bulk is then labeled on the patient's chest by an ink marker.We believe that this method may improve morbidity, operative time, and consequently, hospitalization length and costs.",

    "articleAbstract": "Abstracts Background: Among current surgical options used for treating breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), autologous lymph node transfer (ALNT) is shown to provide favorable results. However, postoperative donor-site lymphedema (DSL), following the lymphatic flap harvesting from the groin area, has already been reported. Our aim is to summarize the recent literature for evidence of DSL following an ALNT for BCRL.A PubMed bibliographic search was performed for published studies evaluating donor-site complications following LNT in BCRL patients. We recorded demographic data of the patients, the type of flap used, the follow-up, the donor-site morbidity, and the diagnostic tests performed pre- and postoperatively. Statistical analysis was conducted to document any correlation between the incidence of DSL and the abovementioned recorded parameters. According to our results, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. From a total of 189 patients, three cases with DSL of the lower limb were reported (1.6%). No statistically significant correlations were found.ALNT has become increasingly popular and is considered an effective surgical option for treating BCRL of the upper limb. Although the incidence of postoperative DSL is low, insufficient data on patients' demographics, surgical details, and postoperative assessment do not allow extracting significant correlations. Meticulous technique of lymph node harvesting should be seriously considered to further minimize this infrequent but debilitating complication.",

    "articleAbstract": "Background Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. Influenza vaccine is an important influenza prevention strategy and the preparations used display good safety and tolerability profiles. But the safety of applying influenza vaccine on the clinical cured leprosy patients is unclear. Methods We conducted an observational clinical study, in Wuhan between November 15, 2016 and March 1, 2017. Two groups of participants ≥50 years of age received a 0.5ml dose of the inactivated split-virion trivalent influenza vaccine and a follow-up 28 days observation of any solicited and unsolicited adverse events. Results A total of 134 subjects were included in the study. The total rate of reactogenicity was 5.4% [2/37] in leprosy group and 15.5% [15/ 97] in control group, the difference of reactogenicity between two groups not significant (p = 0.1522). For solicited injection-sites adverse events (AEs), 12.4% [12/ 97] participants in the control group reported of itching, pain, erythema, swelling or induration, and no participantsin leprosy group reported of any solicited injection-sites AEs. For solicited systemic AEs, 7.2% [7 / 97] participants in the control group reported of fever, malaise or headache, and 2.7% [1 / 37] participants in the leprosy group reported of fever, statistic result showed that the difference was not significant (p = 0.4438). Unsolicited AEs was reported by one male aged 76, 4 hours after vaccination administration, his plantar ulcer area began bleeding. All AEs were grade 1 or grade 2, and no recurrence of lepra reaction, AEs leading to early withdrawal from the study, or deaths were reported in this study. Conclusions To our knowledge, the present study is the first clinical study to evaluate the safety of influenza vaccine in clinically cured leprosy patients. We concluded that clinically cured leprosy patients are relatively safe for influenza vaccine. More importantly, our study make a positive and scientific efforts to eradicate discrimination on leprosy. In our study, we described a patient with plantar ulcer undergoing bleeding for 4 hours after vaccine administration. Based on evidence we have, we interpret that this adverse event may probably associated with vaccine, and patients with ulcer and leprosy need intensive attention after vaccines administration.",

In this study, we investigated the current situation in this respect of different food supplements and beer brands. Eleven food supplements and 24 beer brands were obtained from Helsinki, Finland. Sample preparation was carried out by established methods while estrogenic activities were assessed by a yeast bioluminescent assay, using two recombinant yeast strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae BMAEREluc/ERα and S. cerevisiae BMA64/luc). All the food supplements as well as 81% of the beer samples tested were found to be estrogenic, with estradiol equivalent concentrations of food supplements and beer brands ranging from 7.5 to 11.5 µg/ml and from below detection limits to 43.6 ng/ml, respectively. The estrogenic activities detected in beer samples were not dependent on the beer's alcoholic content, the country of production, or the size of the production brewery. The results of our study imply that both food supplements and beers can be a significant source of human exposure to estrogens. Therefore, further studies and regular surveillance are warranted.",

    "articleAbstract": "Increased life expectancy of persons living with HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy heightens the importance of preventing and treating chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. While guidelines have increasingly advocated more aggressive use of statins for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction, it is unclear whether people with HIV, especially women, are receiving statins when indicated, and whether their HIV disease is a factor in access. We assessed the cumulative incidence of statin use after an indication in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), from 2000 to 2014. Additionally, we used weighted proportional hazards regression to estimate the effect of HIV serostatus on the time to initiation of a statin after an indication. Cumulative incidence of statin use 5 years after an indication was low: 38% in HIV-seropositive women and 30% in HIV-seronegative women. Compared to HIV-seronegative women, the weighted hazard ratio for initiation of a statin for HIV-seropositive women over 5 years was 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62, 1.43]. Applying the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines increased the proportion of HIV-seropositive women with a statin indication from 16% to 45%. Clinicians treating HIV-seropositive women should consider more aggressive management of the dyslipidemia often found in this population.",

This matched-cohort study included HIV-TB patients as cases and HIV-uninfected tuberculosis (non-HIV-TB) patients as controls. Tuberculosis was culture-confirmed in both groups. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio on age, sex, and year of diagnosis. TB-AEs were defined as Grade 2 or higher requiring drug discontinuation/regimen change. From 2003 to 2015, 94 cases and 376 controls were analyzed (95% men, 98% Asians). Standard four-drug combination therapy was initiated in 91% of cases and 89% of controls (p = 0.45). Cases had a higher frequency of TB-AE [51% (48/94) vs. 10% (39/376), p < 0.001]. Their major TB-AEs were fever (19%), rash (11%), and neutropenia (11%). TB-AEs were more severe in cases [Grade 3 or higher: cases (71%, 34/48) vs. controls (49%, 19/39), p < 0.001]. The time from treatment initiation to TB-AE was shorter in cases [median 18 (interquartile range 12-28) vs. 27 (15-57) days, p = 0.027], and 73% of TB-AEs in cases occurred within 4 weeks of starting anti-tuberculosis treatment. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for TB-AEs in the multivariate Cox analysis [adjusted HR (aHR): 6.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.93-12.3]. TB-AEs occurred more frequently in HIV-TB than in non-HIV-TB patients, and were more severe. The majority of TB-AEs occurred within 4 weeks of initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because TB-AEs may delay ART initiation, careful monitoring during this period is warranted in coinfected patients.",

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective and safe method of preventing HIV infection; however, despite US Food and Drug Administration approval, utilization remains low, in part, due to structural barriers, particularly access to healthcare. In this study, we used social media to recruit black, Hispanic, and white HIV-uninfected 18- to 24-year-old YMSM. Participants completed an online survey about their sexual behavior, healthcare access, and previous use of PrEP. Of the 2297 YMSM surveyed, only 3.4% had used PrEP. PrEP use was associated with higher levels of education, living alone, older age, higher levels of sexual activity, and greater healthcare access, specifically having healthcare insurance and a clinic or primary care provider (PCP) from whom they received care. Among PrEP nonusers, 65% met at least one of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended indications for PrEP use, and of these, 59% had healthcare insurance and received care in a clinic and/or had a PCP. Multi-variable multi-nomial logistic regression modeling identified disparities in access to healthcare by age, race/ethnicity, education, and region. Specifically, older YMSM, blacks and Hispanics, those with fewer years of formal education, and residents of the southern and the western United States were more likely to lack healthcare access. These results demonstrate both potential opportunities and barriers to the scale-up of PrEP among YMSM.",

    "articleAbstract": "This research explores the perceptions of adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) as they transition into parenthood. We conducted hour-long, semistructured audio-recorded interviews with a purposive sample of 17 AYA parents with PHIV who were current or former patients at two US pediatric/adolescent infectious diseases clinics. Participants were asked about challenges/rewards of parenting and anticipated future fertility desires/intentions. Analysis of the transcribed interviews was guided by grounded theory. Mean age of participants was 22 years. The majority were African American (n = 8) or Hispanic (n = 6) and female (n = 14). Two participants were pregnant and others had a range of 1-3 children (mean = 1.4), one of whom was HIV positive. Analyses revealed that time with their child was a valuable commodity. Participants expressed concerns about not \"being there\" for their child due to sickness and worries that their child may experience HIV-related discrimination once a parent's HIV status was disclosed. The importance of being a role model and present in their child's life over time was emphasized and served as motivation to pursue education and employment opportunities. Those parents who intended to have another child were motivated by a strong desire to create a legacy and a family of their own as a way to deal with HIV-related losses and stigma. Participants reported the importance of emotional support offered by providers, as well as concrete social services available in that care setting even if they had transitioned to adult care. AYA also expressed parenting rewards/challenges similar to those of their uninfected peers. As youth with PHIV continue to mature, increasing numbers will become parents. It is incumbent upon both pediatric and adult providers to support newly formed families living in the context of intergenerational HIV infection.",

    "articleAbstract": "The Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) demonstrated that long-term supplemental oxygen did not reduce time to hospital admission or death for patients who have stable COPD and resting and/or exercise-induced moderate oxyhemoglobin desaturation, nor did it provide benefit for any other outcome measured in the trial. Nine months after initiation of patient screening, after randomization of 34 patients to treatment, a trial design amendment broadened the eligible population, expanded the primary outcome, and reduced the goal sample size. Within a few years, the protocol had minor modifications, and a second trial design amendment lowered the required sample size because of lower than expected treatment group crossover rates. After 5.5 years of recruitment, the trial met its amended sample size goal, and 1 year later, it achieved its follow-up goal. The process of publishing the trial results brought renewed scrutiny of the study design and the amendments. This manuscript expands on the previously published design and methods information, provides the rationale for the amendments, and gives insight into the investigators' decisions about trial conduct. The story of the LOTT may assist investigators in future trials, especially those that seek to assess the efficacy and safety of long-term oxygen therapy.

The purpose of this study is to identify the diagnostic accuracy of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1)-a protein biomarker-in comparison with CT-scan findings post-TBI. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review of eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias according to the QUADAS-2 checklist. A total of 13 reports from 10 original studies were included. Based on our analysis, serum UCH-L1 has a high accuracy in predicting CT findings in mild to moderate TBI. Based on the QUADAS-2 checklist, this result has a high risk of bias affecting its applicability. The plasma level of UCH-L1 has moderate accuracy in predicting CT findings when assessed in all GCS levels. This result has a low risk of bias and low concerns regarding applicability. Pooled analysis suggests that the plasma/serum UCH-L1 level has high accuracy in predicting CT findings in a wide range of GCS in patients with TBI. This result has a high risk of bias and high concern about its applicability. The heterogeneity in approaching TBI biomarker interferes with drawing a definitive conclusion. Therefore, although UCH-L1 is a promising blood-based diagnostic biomarker for TBI, but due to differences in reported diagnostic accuracy, further studies are needed to recommend UCH-L1 as an alternative to CT scanning.",

In this study, we collected data from 7293 industrial workers in China. The association between occupational exposure of noise and dust and blood pressure was investigated. Controlling for demographic variables, including sex, age, and length of service, a stepwise regression model with backward elimination was constructed. The results showed that both noise and dust decreased the level of systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001). This finding prompted the manufacturing industry to reduce noise and dust hazards and protect the occupational health of workers. Prospective studies in different populations are still required to verify the net contribution of noise and dust to the decrease in blood pressure.",

    "articleAbstract": "Objective The present research relies on two main objectives. The first is to investigate whether latent model analysis through a structural equation model can be implemented on driving simulator data in order to define an unobserved driving performance variable. Subsequently, the second objective is to investigate and quantify the effect of several risk factors including distraction sources, driver characteristics, road and traffic environment on the overall driving performance and not in independent driving performance measures Methods For the scope of the present research, 95 participants from all age groups were asked to drive under different types of distraction (conversation with passenger, cell phone use) in urban and rural road environment with low and high traffic volume in a driving simulator experiment. Then, in the framework of the statistical analysis, a correlation table is presented investigating any of a broad class of statistical relationships between driving simulator measures while a structural equation model has been developed in which overall driving performance is estimated as a latent variable based on several individual driving simulator measures. Results Results confirm the suitability of the structural equation model and indicate that the selection of the specific performance measures that define overall performance should be guided by a rule of representativeness between the selected variables. Moreover, results indicate that conversation with the passenger was not found to have a statistically significant effect indicating that drivers do not change their performance while conversing with a passenger compared to undistracted driving. On the other hand, results support the notion hypothesis that cell phone use has a negative effect on driving performance. Furthermore, regarding driver characteristics, both age, gender and experience have a significant effect on driving performance indicating that driver-related characteristics play the most crucial role in overall driving performance Conclusions The findings of this study allow a new approach on the investigation of driving behaviour in driving simulator experiments and in general. By the successful implementation of the structural equation model, driving behaviour can be assessed in terms of the overall performance and not through individual performance measures which allows an important scientific step forward from piecemeal analyses to a sound combined analysis of the interrelationship between several risk factors and overall driving performance.",

Supply chain failures or bottlenecks may be attributed to: weak and poorly institutionalized logistic management information systems (LMIS), poor physical infrastructures in LMICs, lack of trained and dedicated staff for supply chain management, inadequate funding, and rigid government policies on task sharing. However, there is evidence that implementing effective LMISs and involving public and private providers will distribution channels resulted in reduction in medical commodities' stockout rates.Supply chain bottlenecks contribute significantly to persistent high stockout rates for modern contraceptives in LMICs. Interventions aimed at enhancing uptake of contraceptives to reduce the problem of unmet need in LMICs should make strong commitments towards strengthening these countries' health commodities supply chain management systems. Current evidence is limited and additional, and well-designed implementation research on contraception supply chain systems is warranted to gain further understanding and insights on the determinants of supply chain bottlenecks and their impact on stockouts of contraception commodities.",

We hypothesized that the (-G308A) polymorphism of the TNF-α gene is associated with the severity of PPF and that these polymorphisms influence TNF-α expression.In this cross-sectional study, we genotyped these polymorphisms within the TNF-α gene in 256 Brazilian subjects infected with Schistosoma mansoni, with different patterns of PPF.The genotype (-308) AA was associated with a significant increase in the risk to advanced PPF (OR = 4.60; p = 0.009). In addition, median levels of TNF-α were higher in patients with moderate to advanced PPF, compared with mild fibrosis (20 and 17.3 pg/mL, respectively; p = 0.040). There was no association between average serum levels of TNF-α and (-G308A) TNF-α polymorphism.Our results suggest that genotypes (-308) AA may be a risk factor for severity in advanced PPF, in this Brazilian population, and could potentially be used to predict the severity of advanced PPF in schistosomiasis.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nauclea latifolia is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of male reproductive diseases. Despite its vast uses, its effects on the male reproductive system have not been scientifically proven. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Nauclea latifolia root decoction on sexual behavior and functions in male rabbits. Twenty-four male rabbits were divided into four groups: The first group received daily distilled water orally. The second, third, and fourth groups were orally treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight of Nuclea latifolia root, respectively. Sexual behavior parameters were carried out on weeks 1, 2, and 3 of the study. Testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured from the serum, while the testes tissue samples were used for antioxidant and histopathological examinations. Treatment with 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight resulted in significantly (p < .05) increased frequencies of mounting and intromission. In addition, the ejaculation latency was significantly prolonged (p < .05). The latencies of mounting and intromission were significantly decreased (p < .05), whereas ejaculation frequency increased. Serum testosterone, FSH, and LH increased significantly (p < .05) after treatment with Nuclea latifolia. There was an increase in epididymal sperm counts at 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight doses compared to the control. The extract also increased sperm motility and viability and improved testicular oxidative status. Histological examination revealed an increase in germinal layer thickness. The present study suggests that treatment with N. latifolia improves male sexual function and fertility and protects the testes from oxidative damage.",

    "articleAbstract": "Based on a previous survey by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) in the USA, quite a number of foreign research scientists have been found guilty of research misconduct. However, it remains unclear as to whether or not cultural factors really contribute to research misconduct. This study is based on a series of interviews with Malaysian researchers from the local universities regarding their own professional experiences involving working with researchers or research students from different countries or of different nationalities. Most of the researchers interviewed agreed that cultures do shape individual character, which influences the way that such individuals conduct research, their decision-making and their style of academic writing. Our findings also showed that working culture within the institution also influences research practices, as well as faculty mentorship of the younger generation of researchers. Given the fact such misconduct might be due to a lack of understanding of research or working cultures or practices within the institution, the impact on the scientific community and on society could be destructive. Therefore, it is suggested that the institution has an important role to play in orienting foreign researchers through training, mentoring and discussion with regard to the 'does' and 'don'ts' related to research, and to provide them with an awareness of the importance of ethics when it comes to conducting research.",

    "articleAbstract": "Heart failure (HF) is associated with disturbances in mitochondrial energy production. This mitochondrial dysfunction is reflected by depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in different tissues. Our aims were to determine if there was a correlation between mtDNA content measured in myocardial tissue and the easily accessible peripheral blood cells of patients with non-ischemic HF; and to determine if there was a correlation between myocardial mtDNA and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction.We prospectively collected paired myocardial tissue and peripheral blood samples from 13 consecutive end-stage non-ischemic HF patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. mtDNA content was assessed with real-time quantitative PCR by calculating the relative ratio of two specific mitochondrial sequences and one nuclear control gene sequence.HF patients with lower myocardial mtDNA content had a significantly lower LV ejection fraction (r = 0.65, p = 0.016). Peripheral blood mtDNA content correlated positively with right ventricular myocardial mtDNA content (r = 0.63, p = 0.021). We also observed that averaged myocardial DNA content tended to correlate with peripheral blood mtDNA content (r = 0.53, p = 0.061).In non-ischemic HF patients, myocardial mtDNA content is positively correlated with peripheral blood mtDNA content and LV function as assessed by echocardiography.",

    "articleAbstract": "Interaction between biological systems and environmental electric or magnetic fields has gained attention during the past few decades. Although there are a lot of studies that have been conducted for investigating such interaction, the reported results are considerably inconsistent. Besides the complexity of biological systems, the important reason for such inconsistent results may arise due to different excitation protocols that have been applied in different experiments. In order to investigate carefully the way that external electric or magnetic fields interact with a biological system, the parameters of excitation, such as intensity or frequency, should be selected purposefully due to the influence of these parameters on the system response. In this study, pancreatic β cell, the main player of blood glucose regulating system, is considered and the study is focused on finding the natural frequency spectrum of the system using modeling approach. Natural frequencies of a system are important characteristics of the system when external excitation is applied. The result of this study can help researchers to select proper frequency parameter for electrical excitation of β cell system. The results show that there are two distinct frequency ranges for natural frequency of β cell system, which consist of extremely low (or near zero) and 100-750 kHz frequency ranges. There are experimental works on β cell exposure to electromagnetic fields that support such finding.",

Consecutive adult patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at our institution and who had received fluconazole as systemic antifungal prophylaxis from June 2007 to January 2015 were included. We compared the clinical outcomes between patients with a past history of IA who showed a complete resolution of chest CT abnormalities (n = 13) and those without a previous history of IA (n = 137).The cumulative incidence of proven or probable IA was 8.8% in the group without a past history of IA and 0.0% in the group with a past history of IA (p = .268). The cumulative incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal disease (IFD) within 100 days after allogeneic HSCT was 10.9% in the group without a past history of IA and 15.4% in the group with a past history of IA (p = .647). Fluconazole was switched to anti-mould agents in two-thirds of the patients in each group by day 100 after HSCT.Fluconazole was confirmed to be an acceptable prophylactic agent early after allogeneic HSCT in appropriately selected patients.",

However, not all subjects with allergic asthma develop the LAR after allergen inhalation. Blood-based transcriptional biomarkers that can identify such individuals may help in subject recruitment for clinical trials as well as provide novel molecular insights.To identify blood-based transcriptional biomarker panels that can predict an individual's response to allergen inhalation challenge.We applied RNA sequencing to total RNA from whole blood (n=36) collected before and after allergen challenge and generated both genome-guided and de novo datasets: UCSC genes, UCSC gene-isoforms, Ensembl and Trinity. Candidate biomarker panels were validated using the NanoString platform in an independent cohort of 33 subjects.The Trinity biomarker panel consisting of known and novel biomarker transcripts had an AUROC of greater than 0.70 in both the discovery and validation cohorts. The Trinity biomarker panel was useful in predicting the response of subjects that elicited different responses (accuracy between 0.65-0.71) and subjects that elicit a dual response (accuracy between 0.70-0.75) upon repeated allergen inhalation challenges.Interestingly, the biomarker panel containing novel transcripts successfully validated compared to panels with known, well-characterized genes. These biomarker-blood tests may be used to identify asthmatic subjects who develop the LAR, and may also represent members of novel molecular mechanisms that can be targeted for therapy.",

Women with RPL were divided into two groups according to their homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) scores. The IR group received metformin approximately 3 months before pregnancy. The percentage of lymphocyte subsets and other blood biochemical indices were tested. The HOMA-IR and fasting serum insulin levels were related to the percentage of lymphocyte subsets. The women with RPL had higher CD3(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) cell levels while CD56(+)CD16(+)cell levels were lower. A higher likelihood of cellular immune abnormalities was observed. Women with normal lymphocyte subsets had normal pregnancy outcomes. Metformin significantly downregulated CD3(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) cells and improved pregnancy outcomes. IR was associated with cellular immune abnormalities in RPL. The data suggests that metformin affected the immune/inflammatory response, which may regulate the cellular immune balance and improve pregnancy outcomes.

    "articleAbstract": "20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoicacid (20-HETE) is an important mediator that regulates vascular tone and blood pressure (BP). Although various experimental animal hypertension models demonstrated that 20-HETE contributes to increased vascular resistance and BP, these effects have not been studied in Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)-induced hypertension model. In this study, we investigated the effects of 20-HETE on the vascular responsiveness and BP in an L-NAME-induced hypertension. Wistar Albino rats were used in this study. Hypertension was induced by the addition of L-NAME to drinking water for 5 weeks. The study was performed in three stages: first, BP changes were monitored in real time in the presence of 20-HETE enzymatic inhibitor, N-hydroxy-N´-(4-butly-2-methylphenyl)-formamidine (HET-0016) for 1 h. Second, vascular responses of the conduit and resistance arteries were investigated in the presence or absence of HET-0016 in the organ bath. Third, BP was monitored weekly in some hypertensive animals treated with HET-0016 and vascular responses were investigated at the end of the experiment. We demonstrated an increase in 20-HETE levels in the resistance arteries of hypertensive animals. 20-HETE inhibition by HET-0016 significantly decreased BP in L-NAME-induced hypertension model. In addition, HET-0016 treatment caused significant improvement in vascular dilator and constrictor responses in the conduit and resistance arteries. This study demonstrates an important role of 20-HETE in increasing BP and altering vascular responsiveness in L-NAME-induced hypertension model, which suggests a possible involvement of 20-HETE in essential hypertension development in humans.",

    "articleAbstract": "Fibrocytes are circulating cells that have fibroblast properties. They are produced by the bone marrow stroma, and they move from the blood to injured organs using multiple chemokine pathways. They exhibit marked functional and phenotypic plasticity in response to the local tissue microenvironment to ensure a pro-inflammatory or a more resolving phenotype. They can adopt immune cell properties and modulate conventional immune cell functions. Although their exact function is not always clear, they have emerged as key effector cells in several fibrotic diseases like keloid, scleroderma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, evidence suggested that fibrocytes could contribute to bronchial obstructive diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this review, we summarize the reported roles of fibrocytes and their pathfinding into the lung in the context of asthma and COPD. We give an overview of the different roles played by fibrocytes and discuss their possible contributions to these obstructive diseases.",

    "articleAbstract": "Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease with substantial morbidity and increasing mortality. As a part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's workshop to better understand this disease and improve the outcomes of sarcoidosis patients, we reviewed the available data on health care burden and outcomes of this disease in the United States (U.S.). Disparities in outcomes exist by race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic groups, with African Americans having disproportionately more severe disease. Mortality rates are highest in African Americans, but may be increasing in Caucasians. The health care burden of sarcoidosis is defined not only by its somatic manifestations, but is also greatly impacted by psychosocial, economic, and comorbid conditions associated with this disease. Fatigue, depression, cognitive dysfunction, treatment side effects, and pain syndromes are highly prevalent in this population and contribute to poor outcomes. The direct and indirect economic costs to patients and society are likely also substantial, although not well defined. We recommend leveraging existing and future technology and infrastructure in order to more accurately define and monitor the overall total sarcoidosis-attributable health care burden and patient outcomes in the U.S.",

This study aims at characterizing mixtures of those biopolymers at high concentrations (up to 100 mg·mL(-1)) at which collagen has mesogenic properties. We use a structural approach combining polarization-resolved multiphoton microscopy, polarized light microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and transmission electron microscopy to analyze gelatin and collagen/gelatin dense phases in their sol and gel states from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale. We first report the formation of a lyotropic crystal phase of gelatin A and show that gelatin must structure itself in particles to become mesogenic. We demonstrate that mixtures of collagen and gelatin phase segregate, preserving the setting of the pure collagen mesophase at a gelatin ratio of up to 20% and generating a biphasic fractal sample at all tested ratios. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetric analysis shows that each protein separates into two populations. Both populations of gelatins are stabilized by the presence of collagen, whereas only one population of collagen molecules is stabilized by the presence of gelatin, most probably those at the interface of the fibrillated microdomains and of the gelatin phase. Although further studies are needed to fully understand the involved mechanism, these new data should have a direct impact on the bioengineering of those two biopolymers.",

    "articleAbstract": "To reduce unwanted variation in the passage speed of DNA through solid-state nanopores, we demonstrate nanoscale pre-confinement of translocating molecules using an ultra-thin nanoporous silicon nitride membrane separated from a single sensing nanopore by a nanoscale cavity. We present comprehensive experimental and simulation results demonstrating that the presence of an integrated nanofilter within nanoscale distances of the sensing pore eliminates the dependence of molecular passage time distributions on pore size, revealing a global minimum in the coefficient of variation of the passage time. These results provide experimental verification that the inter- and intra-molecular passage time variation depends on the conformational entropy of each molecule prior to translocation. Furthermore, we show that the observed consistently narrower passage time distributions enables a more reliable DNA length separation independent of pore size and stability. We also demonstrate that the composite nanofilter/nanopore devices can be configured to suppress the frequency of folded translocations, ensuring single-file passage of captured DNA molecules. By greatly increasing the rate at which usable data can be collected, these unique attributes will offer significant practical advantages to many solid-state nanopore-based sensing schemes, including sequencing, genomic mapping, and barcoded target detection.",

    "articleAbstract": "Thermal transport in amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO2) is traditionally treated as random walks of vibrations owing to its greatly disordered structure, which results in a mean free path (MFP) approximately the same as the interatomic distance. However, this picture has been debated constantly and in view of the ubiquitous existence of thin a-SiO2 layers in nanoelectronic devices, it is imperative to better understand this issue for precise thermal management of electronic devices. Different from the commonly used cross-plane measurement approaches, here we report on a study that explores the in-plane thermal conductivity of double silicon nanoribbons with a layer of a-SiO2 sandwiched in-between. Through comparing the thermal conductivity of the double ribbon samples with that of corresponding single ribbons, we show that thermal phonons can ballistically penetrate through a-SiO2 of up to 5 nm thick even at room temperature. Comprehensive examination of double ribbon samples with various oxide layer thicknesses and van der Waals bonding strengths allows for extraction of the average ballistic phonon penetration depth in a-SiO2. With solid experimental data demonstrating ballistic phonon transport through a-SiO2, this work should provide important insight into thermal management of electronic devices.",

    "articleAbstract": "Complex nanoemulsions, comprising multi-phase nanoscale droplets, hold considerable potential advantages as vehicles for encapsulation and delivery as well as templates for nanoparticle synthesis. Although methods exist to controllably produce complex emulsions at the micron-scale, very few methods exist to produce them at the nano-scale. Here, we examine a recently developed method involving a combination of high-energy emulsification with conventional co-surfactants to produce oil-water-oil (O/W/O) complex nanoemulsions. Specifically, we study in detail how the composition of the conventional ethoxylated co-surfactants Span80 and Tween20 influences the morphology and structure of the resulting complex nanoemulsions in the water-cyclohexane system. Using a combination of small-angle neutron scattering and cryo-electron microscopy, we find that the co-surfactant composition controls the generation of complex droplet morphologies including core-shell and multi-core shell O/W/O nanodroplets, resulting in an effective \"state diagram\" for the selection of nanoemulsion morphology. Additionally, the co-surfactant composition can be used to control the thickness of the water shell contained within the complex nanodroplets. We hypothesize that this degree of control, despite the highly non-equilibrium nature of the nanoemulsions, is ultimately determined by a competition between the opposing spontaneous curvature of the two co-surfactants, which strongly influences the interfacial curvature of the nanodroplets due to their ultra-low interfacial tension. This is supported by a strong correlation between co-surfactant compositions that produce complex nanoemulsions and those that produce homogeneous mixed micelles in equilibrium surfactant-cyclohexane solutions. Ultimately, we show that the formation of complex O/W/O nanoemulsion is weakly perturbed upon addition of hydrophilic polymer pre-cursors, facilitating their use as templates for the formation of polymer nanocapsules.",

    "articleAbstract": "The capabilities of Atomic Force Microscopes and Optical Tweezers to probe unfolding or surface-to-molecule bond rupture at a single-molecular level are widely appreciated. These measurements are typically carried out unidirectional under non-equilibrium conditions. Jarzynski's equality has proven useful to relate the work obtained along these non-equilibrium trajectories to the underlying free energy of the unfolding or unbinding process. Here, we quantify biases that arise from the molecular design of the bond rupture experiment for probing surface-to-molecule bonds. In particular, we probe the well-studied amine/gold bond as a function of the linker's length which is used to anchor the specific amine functionality during a single molecule unbinding experiment. With increasing linker length, we observe a significant increase in the average work spent on polymer stretching and a strongly biased estimated interaction free energy. Our data demonstrate that free energy estimates converge well for linker lengths below 20 nm, where the bias is ˂10-15%. With longer linkers severe methodical limits of the method are reached, and convergence within a reasonable number of realizations of the bond rupture is not feasible. Our results also provide new insights into stability and work dissipation mechanisms at adhesive interfaces at the single-molecular level, and offer important design and analysis aspects for single-molecular surface-to-molecule experiments.",

First the emulsion structure is analyzed microscopically through optical and epifluorescence microscopies, and macroscopically by the study of the rheological behaviors. The average droplet size decreases with h-BN concentration whereas the emulsions achieve good stability at 2 wt% BN concentrations and for a one to one o/w ratio. In all formulations, the emulsions are of water-in-oil (W/O) type due mainly to the hydrophobicity of h-BN.",

    "articleAbstract": "The intra- and intermolecular bonding in the known phase of dihydroxylammonium 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate, TKX-50, has been analyzed based on the experimentally determined charge density distribution from high resolution X-ray diffraction data obtained at 20 K. This was compared to the charge density obtained from DFT calculations with periodic boundary conditions using both direct calculations and derived structure factors. Results of topological analysis of the electron density corroborate that TKX-50 is best described as a layered structure linked primarily by a number of hydrogen bonds as well as by a variety of other interactions. Additional bonding interactions were identified, including a pair of equivalent 1,5-type intramolecular closed-shell interactions in the dianion. Refinement of anharmonic motion was shown to be essential for obtaining an adequate model, despite the low temperature of the study. Although generally unusual, the implementation of anharmonic refinement provided a significant improvement compared to harmonic refinement of both traditional and split-core multipole models.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nitrenium and oxenium ions are important reactive intermediates in synthetic and biological processes, and their ground electronic configurations are of great interest due to having distinct reactivities and properties. In general, the closed-shell singlet state of these intermediates usually react as electrophiles, while reactions of the triplet states of these ions react like typical diradicals (e.g. H-atom abstractions). Non-substituted phenyl nitrenium ions (Ph-NH+) and phenyl oxenium ions (Ph-O+) have closed-shell singlet ground states with large singlet-triplet gaps resulting from a strong break in the degeneracy of the p orbitals on the formal nitrenium/oxenium center. Remarkably, we find computationally (CBS-QB3 and G4MP2) that azulenyl nitrenium and oxenium ions can have triplet ground states depending upon the attachment position on the azulene core. For instance, CBS-QB3 predicts 1-azulenyl nitrenium ion and 1-azulenyl oxenium ion are singlet ground state species with considerable singlet-triplet gaps of -47 and -45 kcal/mol to the lowest-energy triplet state, respectively. In contrast, 6-azulenyl nitrenium ion and 6-azulenyl oxenium ion have triplet ground states with a singlet-triplet gap of +7 and +10 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, the triplet states are π,π* states, rather than the typical n,π* states seen for many aryl nitrenium or oxenium ions. This dramatic switch in favored electronic states can be ascribed to changes in ring aromaticity/antiaromaticity, with the switch from ground-state singlet ions to triplet-favored ions resulting from both a destabilized singlet state (Hückel antiaromatic) and a stabilized triplet (Baird aromatic) state. Density functional theory (UB3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)) was used to determine substituent effects on the singlet-triplet energy gap for azulenyl nitrenium and oxenium ions, and we find that the unusual ground triplet states can be further tuned by employing electron-donating or -withdrawing groups on the azulene ring. This work demonstrates that azulenyl nitrenium and oxenium ions can have triplet π,π* ground states, and provides a simple recipe for making ionic intermediates with distinct electronic configurations and consequent prediction of unique reactivity and magnetic properties from these species.",

    "articleAbstract": "A method to generate levitating monodisperse microdroplet clusters with an arbitrary number of identical droplets is presented. Clusters with 1 to 28 droplets levitate over a locally heated water layer in an ascending vapor-air jet. Due to the attraction to the center of the heated area combined with aerodynamic repulsion between the droplets, the clusters form structures, which are quite diverse and different from densest packing of hard spheres. The clusters self-organize into stable and reproducible configurations dependent on the number of droplets while independent of droplets' size. The central parts of larger clusters reproduce the shape of smaller clusters. The ability to synthesize stable clusters with a given number of droplets is important for tracing droplets, which is crucial for potential applications such as micro-reactors and for chemical analysis of small volumes of liquid.",

    "articleAbstract": "A new class of donor-acceptor hetero-dimers based on two singlet-fission-active chromophores, i.e. Pentacene (Pc) and Perylenediimide (PDI), were developed to investigate the role of charge transfer state on the excitonic dynamics. The CT state is efficiently generated upon photoexcitation. However, the resulting CT state decays to different energy states depending on the energy levels of the CT state. It undergoes extremely rapid deactivation to the ground state in polar CH2Cl2, whereas transformation to Pc triplet in nonpolar toluene. The efficient triplet generation in toluene is not due to singlet fission, but CT-mediated intersystem crossing. In the light of energy landscape, it is suggested the deep energy level of CT state relative to that of the triplet pair state makes the CT state actually serve as a trap state that cannot undergoes iSF process. These results provide guidance for the design of singlet fission materials and highlight the requisite for more widely applicable design principles.",

    "articleAbstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are an emerging class of environment-friendly media useful in a variety of applications. However, the microscopic structure of these liquids is quite unclear and issues like whether spatial and dynamic heterogeneity is a generic feature of the ionic DESs and whether the solute molecules experience similar environment and interactions with the medium irrespective of their charge are still open. In this work, we have attempted to address some of these issues for ethaline, a less viscous and ionic DES consisting of a mixture of 1:2 mole ratio of choline chloride and ethylene glycol by monitoring the fluorescence response of a number of carefully chosen neutral and charged probe molecules in ensemble and single molecule conditions. Specifically, we have examined the liquid state structure of ethaline by studying the rotational and translational diffusion dynamics of the solutes measured by monitoring the time-dependence of fluorescence anisotropy in ensemble condition and fluorescence correlation signal of extremely dilute samples diffusing through confocal volume. These studies clearly reveal dynamic heterogeneity of the medium, though no spatial heterogeneity is observable through excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence measurements. The insights obtained from this study will be helpful in understanding the nature of solute-solvent interactions in this type of complex media.",

    "articleAbstract": "Three new modified peptides named grassystatins D-F (1-3) were discovered from a marine cyanobacterium from Guam. Their structures were elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The hallmark structural feature in the peptides is a statine unit, which contributes to their aspartic protease inhibitory activity preferentially targeting cathepsins D and E. Grassystatin F (3) was the most potent analogue, with IC50 values of 50 and 0.5 nM against cathepsins D and E, respectively. The acidic tumor microenvironment is known to increase the activation of some of the lysosomal proteases associated with tumor metastasis such as cathepsins. Because cathepsin D is a biomarker in aggressive forms of breast cancer and linked to poor prognosis, the effects of cathepsin D inhibition by 1 and 3 on the downstream cellular substrates cystatin C and PAI-1 were investigated. Furthermore, the functional relevance of targeting cathepsin D substrates was evaluated by examining the effect of 1 and 3 on the migration of MDA-MD-231 cells. Grassystatin F (3) inhibited the cleavage of cystatin C and PAI-1, the activities of their downstream targets cysteine cathepsins and tPA, and the migration of the highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer cells, phenocopying the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of cathepsin D.",

    "articleAbstract": "Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy of a new water-soluble transition metal complex acting as a vibrational probe shows that over a wide range of concentration and polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecular mass (2000, 8000, and 20,000 Da), the time scale of the sensed hydration dynamics differs negligibly from bulk water (D2O). A notable exception is PEG-400, where we observe a sharp dynamical slowdown near the critical overlap concentration, indicating that chain interactions and possibly collective hydration alters the water dynamics in a manner similar to previous observations in crowded protein solutions. PEG is well known to establish a highly stable hydration shell because the spacing between adjacent ethereal oxygens nearly matches water's hydrogen bonding network. Although these first-shell water molecules are likely significantly retarded, they present a polymer-templated water-like (i.e. \"iceberg\") interface to subsequent hydration shells, and thus diminish the largely entropic perturbation to water's orientational dynamics. In additional to the longer PEGs, a series of concentration dependent 2D-IR measurements using aqueous PEG-400 shows a pronounced hydration slowdown in the vicinity of the critical overlap concentration (c*). Unlike the longer PEGs, PEG-400 has a lower propensity to adopt a helical conformation in water, and this dynamical transition likely reflects the crowding-induced collective hydration slowdown associated with the influence of multiple macromolecular interfaces. Comparison between these dynamical results and previously reported steady-state infrared spectroscopy of aqueous PEG-1000 solutions reveals a strikingly identical dependence on number of water molecules per ethylene oxide monomer, scaled according to the critical overlap concentration.",

Single-crystal XRD reveals that, except for 1, all complexes possess two crystallographically distinct molecules within the unit cell. Both of these crystallographically distinct molecules possess the same molecular formula, but the orientation of the coordinating ligand distinctly differs from those in complexes 2-5. Alternating-current magnetic susceptibility measurement reveals that complexes 1-3 exhibit slow relaxation of magnetization in the presence of an optimum external magnetic field. In contrast to 1-3, complex 4 shows a blockade of magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field, a signature characteristic of a single-ion magnet (SIM). The distinct magnetic behavior observed in 4 compared to other complexes is correlated to the suitable ligand field around a prolate Er(III) ion. Although the ligand field stabilizes an easy axis of anisotropy, quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) is still predominant in 4 because of the low symmetry of the complex. The combination of low symmetry and an unsuitable ligand-field environment in complexes 1-3 triggers faster magnetization relaxation; hence, these complexes exhibit field-induced SIM behavior. In order to understand the electronic structures of complexes 1-4 and the distinct magnetic behavior observed, ab initio calculations were performed. Using the crystal structure of the complexes, magnetic susceptibility data were computed for all of the complexes. The computed susceptibility and magnetization are in good agreement with the experimental magnetic data [χMT(T) and M(H)] and this offers confidence on the reliability of the extracted parameters. A tentative mechanism of magnetization relaxation observed in these complexes is also discussed in detail.",

Here we show that a strong scale effect occurs in nanometer size octadecylammine thin films. This effect is attributed to the different distribution of molecules depending on the size of the film. To accurately describe this effect, we have developed a model which is a reinterpretation of the linearized Thomas-Fermi approximation. Within this model, we have been able to characterize the polarizability of thin films independently of the thickness of the film.",

The oxide thicknesses and the growth rates are obtained from these simulation results.

    "articleAbstract": "Reexamination of the absolute configuration of recently isolated eburnane alkaloids from Malaysian Kopsia and Leuconotis species by X-ray diffraction analysis and ECD/TDDFT has revealed the existence of biosynthetic enantiodivergence. Three different scenarios are discerned with respect to the composition of the enantiomeric eburnane alkaloids in these plants: first, where the new eburnane congeners possess the same C-20, C-21 absolute configurations as the common eburnane alkaloids (eburnamonine, eburnamine, isoeburnamine, eburnamenine) occurring in the same plant; second, where the new eburnane congeners possess opposite or enantiomeric C-20, C-21 absolute configurations compared to the common eburnane alkaloids found in the same plant; and, third, where the four common eburnane alkaloids were isolated as racemic or scalemic mixtures, while the new eburnane congeners were isolated as pure enantiomers with a common C-20, C-21 configuration (20α, 21α). Additionally, the same Kopsia species (K. pauciflora) found in two different geographical locations (Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo) showed different patterns in the composition of the enantiomeric eburnane alkaloids. Revision of the absolute configurations of a number of new eburnane congeners (previously assigned based on the assumption of a common biogenetic origin to that of the known eburnane alkaloids co-occurring in the same plant) is required based on the present results.",

    "articleAbstract": "A protein's stability may range from non-existent, as in the case of intrinsically disordered proteins, to very high, as indicated by a protein's resistance to degradation, even under relatively harsh conditions. The stability of this latter group is usually under kinetic control due to a high activation energy for unfolding that virtually traps the protein in a specific conformation, thereby conferring resistance to proteolytic degradation and misfolding-aggregation. The usual outcome of kinetic stability is a longer protein half-life. Thus, the protective role of protein kinetic stability is often appreciated, but relatively little is known about the extent of biological roles related to this property. In this review, we will discuss several known or putative biological roles of protein kinetic stability, including protection from stressors to avoid aggregation or premature degradation, achieving long-term phenotypic change, and regulating cellular processes by controlling the trigger and timing of molecular motion. The picture that emerges from this analysis is that protein kinetic stability is involved in a myriad of known and yet to be discovered biological functions via its ability to resist degradation and control the timing, extent, and permanency of molecular motion.",

    "articleAbstract": "Mechanical force, with its ability to distort, bend and stretch chemical bonds, is unique in the way it activates chemical reactions. In polymer mechanochemistry, the force is transduced in a directional fashion and the efficiency of activation depends on how well the force is transduced from the polymer to the scissile bond in the mechanophore (i.e. mechanochemical coupling). We have investigated the effects of regio- and stereochemistry on the rate of force-accelerated retro-Diels-Alder reactions of furan/maleimide adducts. Four adducts, presenting an endo or exo configura-tion and proximal or distal geometry, were activated in solution by ultrasound-generated elongational forces. A combina-tion of structural (1H NMR) and computational (CoGEF) analyses allowed us to interrogate the mechanochemical activa-tion of these adducts. We found that, unlike its thermal counterpart where the reactivity is dictated by the stereochemis-try, the mechanical reactivity is mainly dependent on the regiochemistry. Remarkably the thermally active distal-exo adduct becomes inert under tension due to a poor mechanochemical coupling.",

In this study, a shikimic acid (SA) biosensor was constructed from a LysR-type transcriptional regulator (ShiR) of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The SA biosensor specifically responded to the increase of intracellular SA concentration over a linear range of 19.5 ± 3.6 to 120.9 ± 1.2 fmole at the single-cell level. This new SA biosensor was successfully used to 1) monitor the SA production of different C. glutamicum strains; 2) develop a novel result-oriented high-throughput ribosome binding site screening and sorting strategy that was used for engineering high-yield shikimate-producing strains; and 3) engineer a whole-cell biosensor through the co-expression of the SA sensor and a shikimate transporter shiA gene in C. glutamicum RES167. This work demonstrated that a new intracellular SA biosensor is a valuable tool facilitating the fast development of microbial SA producer.",

We also demonstrated the regioselective π-functionalization using prefunctionalized designed molecules possessing the same substructure on the C60 cage. The single crystal X-ray analysis and electrostatic potential map revealed that the orientation of entrapped H2O inside the naphthalene-fused open-cage C60 derivative is electrostatically demanded due to the naphthalene-fusion and construction of the opening.",

We report herein an exceptionally effective chiral photocatalyst that recruits prochiral quinolones using a series of hydrogen-bonding and π-π interactions. The organization of these substrates within the chiral environment of the transition metal photosensitizer leads to efficient Dexter energy transfer and effective stereoinduction. The relative insensitivity of these organometallic chromophores towards ligand modification enables the optimization of this catalyst structure for high enantiomeric excess (ee) at catalyst loadings as much as 100-fold lower than the optimal conditions reported for analogous chiral organic photosensitizers.",

    "articleAbstract": "The creation of reaction networks capable of exhibiting responses that are properties of entire systems represents a significant challenge for the chemical sciences. The system-level behavior of a reaction network is linked intrinsically to its topology and the functional connections between its nodes. A simple network of chemical reactions constructed from four reagents, in which each reagent reacts with exactly two others, can exhibit upregulation of two products even when only a single chemical reaction is addressed catalytically. We implement a system with this topology using two maleimides and two nitrones of different sizes-either short or long and each bearing complementary recognition sites-that react pairwise through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions to create a network of four length-segregated replicating templates. Comprehensive 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments unravel the network topology, confirming that, in isolation, three out of four templates self-replicate, with the shortest template exhibiting the highest efficiency. The strongest template effects within the network are the mutually crosscatalytic relationships between the two templates of intermediate size. The network topology is such that the addition of different preformed templates as instructions to a mixture of all starting materials elicits system-level behavior. Instruction with a single template up-regulates the formation of two templates in a predictable manner. These results demonstrate that the rules governing system-level behavior can be unraveled through the application of wholly synthetic networks with well-defined chemistries and interactions.",

Development of multifunctional electronic textiles (e-textiles) with the capacity to interact with the local environment is a promising strategy for achieving electronic transduction of physical and chemical information. This paper describes a simple and rapid approach for fabricating multifunctional e-textiles by integrating conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into fabrics through direct solution-phase self-assembly from simple molecular building blocks. These e-textiles display reliable conductivity, enhanced porosity, flexibility, and stability to washing. The functional utility of these integrated systems is demonstrated in the context of chemiresistive gas sensing, uptake, and filtration. The self-organized frameworks on textiles (SOFT)-devices detect and differentiate important gaseous analytes (NO, H2S, and H2O) at ppm levels and maintain their chemiresistive function in the presence of humidity (5000 ppm, 18% RH). With sub-ppm theoretical limits of detection (LOD for NO = 0.16 ppm and for H2S = 0.23 ppm), these constitute the best textile-supported H2S and NO detectors reported and the best MOF-based chemiresistive sensors for these analytes. In addition to sensing, these devices are capable of capturing and filtering analytes.",

We illustrate that the method can be very efficiently used to determine Pu oxidation states, which control the solubility limit of Pu in a glass matrix. HR-XANES results show that the addition of excess Si3N4 is not sufficient for complete reduction of Pu to Pu(III), which has a relatively high solubility limit (9-22 wt % Pu) due to its network-modifying behavior in glasses. We provide evidence that the initially added Pu(VI) might be partly preserved during vitrification at 1200/1400 °C in Ar atmosphere. Pu(VI) could be very advantageous for vitrification of Pu-rich wastes, since it might reach solubility limits of 40 wt % comparable to U(VI).",

    "articleAbstract": "Streptomycetes are well-known producers of biologically active secondary metabolites. Various efforts have endeavored to increase productions of these metabolites, while few approaches could well coordinate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and other physiological events of their hosts. Here we develop a universal autoregulated strategy for fine-tuning the expression of secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in Streptomyces species. First, inducible promoters were used to control the expression of secondary metabolites BGCs. Then, the optimal induction condition was determined by response surface model in both dimensions of time and strength. Finally, native promoters with similar transcription profile to the inducible promoter under the optimal condition were identified based on time-course transcriptome analyses, and used to replace the inducible promoter following an elaborate replacement approach. The expression of actinorhodin (Act) and heterogeneous oxytetracycline (OTC) BGCs were optimized in Streptomyces coelicolor using this strategy. Compared to modulation via constitutive promoters, it could dramatically improve the titers of Act and OTC by 1.3- and 9.1-fold, respectively. The autoregulated fine-tuning strategy developed here opens a novel route for titer improvement of desired secondary metabolites in Streptomyces.",

    "articleAbstract": "Recent research has reported increased tolerance to agrochemicals in target and non-target organisms following acute physiological changes induced through phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, the most inducible populations are those from more pristine locations, far from agrochemical use. We asked why do populations with no known history of pesticide exposure have the ability to induce adaptive responses to novel agrochemicals? We hypothesized that increased pesticide tolerance results from a generalized stressor response in organisms, and would be induced following sublethal exposure to natural and anthropogenic stressors. We exposed larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) to one of seven natural or anthropogenic stressors (predator cue (Anax spp.), 0.5 or 1.0 mg carbaryl/L, road salt (200 or 1000 mg Cl-/L), ethanol-vehicle control, or no-stressor control) and subsequently tested their tolerance to a lethal carbaryl concentration using time-to-death assays. We observed induced carbaryl tolerance in tadpoles exposed to 0.5 mg/L carbaryl and also in tadpoles exposed to predator cues. Our results suggest that the ability to induce pesticide tolerance likely arose through evolved anti-predator responses. Given that anti-predator responses are widespread among species, many animals might possess inducible pesticide tolerance, buffering them from agrochemical exposure.",

    "articleAbstract": "The rise of multi- and even totally antibiotic resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis underlines the need for new antibiotics. The pathogen is resistant to β-lactam compounds due to its native serine β-lactamase, BlaC. This resistance can be circumvented by administration of a β-lactamase inhibitor. We studied the interaction between BlaC and the inhibitor clavulanic acid. Our data show hydrolysis of clavulanic acid and recovery of BlaC activity upon prolonged incubation. The rate of clavulanic acid hydrolysis is much higher in the presence of phosphate ions. A specific binding site for phosphate is identified in the active site pocket, both in the crystalline state and in solution. NMR spectroscopy experiments show that phosphate binds to this site with a dissociation constant of 30 mM in the free enzyme. We conclude that inhibition of BlaC by clavulanic acid is reversible and that phosphate ions can promote the hydrolysis of the inhibitor.",

    "articleAbstract": "Inexorably, the environmental persistence and damage caused by polyolefins have become major drawbacks to their continued long-term use. Global shifts in thinking from fossil-fuel to renewable biobased resources have urged researchers to focus their attention on substituting fossil-fuel based polymers with renewable and biodegradable alternatives on an industrial scale. The recent development of biodegradable polyesters from ring opening polymerization (ROP) of bioderived cyclic ester monomers has emerged as a promising new avenue toward this goal. Ever increasing numbers of metal-based initiators have been reported in the literature for the controlled ROP of cyclic esters, in particular for the polymerization of lactide to produce poly(lactic acid) (PLA). PLA has several material weaknesses, which hinder its use as a replacement for commodity plastics. Despite many advances in developing highly active and controlled catalysts for lactide polymerization, no single catalyst system has emerged to replace industrially used catalysts and provide access to PLA materials with improved properties. We reported the first example of indium(III) for the ring opening polymerization of lactide. Since then, indium(III) has emerged as a useful Lewis acid in initiators for the controlled polymerization of lactide and other cyclic esters. In particular, we have developed a large family of chiral dinuclear indium complexes bearing tridentate diaminophenolate ligands and tetradentate salen and salan ligands. Complexes within our tridentate ligand family are highly active initiators for the moderately isoselective living and immortal polymerization of rac-lactide, as well as other cyclic esters. We have shown that subtle steric effects influence aggregation in these systems, with polymerization typically proceeding through a dinuclear propagating species. In addition, profound effects on polymerization activities have been observed for central tertiary versus secondary amine donors in these and other related systems. In contrast, our well-controlled and highly active chiral indium salen systems are more isoselective than the tridentate analogues and polymerize lactide via a mononuclear propagating species. Again, we have noticed that subtle steric and electronic changes to the ligand can influence both polymerization activity and stereoselectivity via aggregation phenomena. Recently, we have reported a promising new chiral indium catalyst supported by a tetradentate salan ligand. This catalyst is remarkably water and air stable and can be activated by linear and branched alcohols to provide controlled access to multiblock copolymers in air. This catalyst represents an important step forward toward generating new, commercially relevant catalysts for ROP of cyclic esters to produce novel biodegradable polymers, and highlights the unique value of indium-based catalysts in the field.",

    "articleAbstract": "The technological development of LC-MS instrumentation has led to significant improvements of performance and sensitivity, enabling high-throughput analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts. Most software suites allow pre-processing of LC-MS chromatograms to obtain comprehensive information on single constituents. However, more advanced processing needs, such as the systematic and unbiased comparative metabolite profiling of large numbers of complex LC-MS chromatograms remains a challenge. Currently, users have to rely on different tools to perform such data analyses. We developed a two-step protocol comprising a comparative metabolite profiling tool integrated in ACD/MS Workbook Suite, and a web platform developed in R language designed for clustering and visualization of chromatographic data. Initially, all relevant chromatographic and spectroscopic data (retention time, molecular ions with the respective ion abundance, and sample names) are automatically extracted and assembled in an Excel spreadsheet. The file is then loaded into an online web application that includes various statistical algorithms and provides the user with tools to compare and visualize the results in intuitive 2D heatmaps. We applied this workflow to LC-ESIMS profiles obtained from 69 honey samples. Within few hours of calculation with a standard PC, honey samples were pre-processed and organized in clusters based on their metabolite profile similarities, thereby highlighting the common metabolite patterns and distributions among samples. Implementation in the ACD/Labs software package enables ulterior integration of other analytical data, and in silico prediction tools for modern drug discovery.",

    "articleAbstract": "Free fatty acids (FFAs) are vitally important components of lipids that modulate biological metabolism in various ways. Although the molecular structures are simple, the analysis of FFAs is still challenging due to their unique properties and wide concentration range. In the present study, a high-coverage liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was established for the quantification of FFAs in serum samples using two structural analogues 5-dimethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl piperazine (Dns-PP) and diethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl piperazine (Dens-PP) as twins derivatization reagents. The Dns labeling of FFAs could significantly enhance their MS response via the introduction of easily ionizable moiety of tertiary amine-containing part and aid fragmentation in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Our results demonstrated that the detection sensitivities of FFAs were increased by 50-1500 folds compared with non-derivatization method. At the same time, Dens labeled standards were used as one-to-one internal standards to ensure accurate quantifications. Thirty-eight FFAs, covering short-, medium- and long-chain, could be quantified in wide dynamic range with lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) varied from 2 to 20 nM. Using this method, we analyzed serum FFAs in rat models of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and irinotecan-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, respectively. The findings were further compared with those revealed by previous untargeted metabolomics. The results indicate that twins derivatization based LC-MS provides more accurate view of global FFAs alternation and has great application potential in the fields of targeted metabolomics.",

Here, we present the development of a nanosecond Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, 220 mJ) in holographic Denisyuk reflection mode method for creating ablative nanopatterns from thin films of four ink colors (black, red, blue, and brown). We establish the use of ink as a recording medium in different colors and absorption ranges to rapidly produce optical nanostructures in 1D geometries. The gratings produced with four different types of ink had the same periodicity (840 nm); however, they produce distant wavelength dependent diffraction responses to monochromatic and broadband light. The nanostructures of gratings consisting of blue and red inks displayed high diffraction efficiency of certain wavelengths while the black and brown ink based gratings diffracted broadband light. These gratings have high potential to be used as low-cost photonic structures in wavelength-dependent optical filters. We anticipate that the rapid production of gratings based on different ink formulations can enable optics applications such as holographic displays in data storage, light trapping, security systems, and sensors.",

In this work, we use cavity quantum electrodynamics analysis to theoretically demonstrate that it is possible to design an electric spaser with an open resonator in the extreme quantum limit in an all-carbon platform. Carbon nanotube quantum dot plays the role of a gain element and Coulomb Blockade is observed. Graphene nanoribbons are used as the resonator and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) field distribution with quantum electrodynamics features can be observed. From an engineering perspective, our work makes preparations for integrating spasers into nanocircuits and/or photodynamic therapy applications.",

    "articleAbstract": "The first paper-based polyion-sensitive optodes are reported. Dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid (a cation exchanger) and chromoionophore I (a lipophilic optical pH indicator) are printed on filter paper in the absence of any plasticizer and/or ad-ditional hydrophobic polymeric phase. The resulting optodes exhibit sensitive colorimetric response to polycations such as protamine but not to small inorganic cations because only polycations are able to form cooperative ion pairs with di-nonylnaphthalene sulfonate adsorbed to the cellulose paper. The color change of the optode is recorded via an iPhone cam-era and analyzed by an iPhone App. The protamine sensing optode platform is used to indirectly detect protease activity (trypsin) based on proteolytic digestion of protamine, and polyanions (pentosan polysulfate and heparin) based on the strong binding reaction of polyanions with protamine. The indirect sensing system is further simplified on a multilayer mem-brane device that consists of an optode paper site modified with buffer to prevent optode dependence on sample pH, and an underlying cellulose acetate filter membrane coated with protamine to eliminate addition of the indicator polycation into the sample. The detection of pentosan polysulfate concentrations in an undiluted urine sample is successfully demonstrated via this approach. Lastly, it is shown that plasticizer-free polyanion-sensitive optodes based on an adsorbed layer of quater-nary ammonium type anion exchanger and a phenolic azo type proton chromoionophore can also be fabricated directly on cellulose paper strips.",

Understanding their structure-function relationships requires sensitive, accurate structural analyses to determine parameters like degree of polymerization (DP), fraction of acetylation (FA) or pattern of acetylation (PA). NMR, the gold standard for FA analysis, requires large amounts of sample. Here, we describe an enzymatic / mass spectrometric fingerprinting method to analyze the FA of chitosan polymers. The method combines the use of chitinosanase, a sequence-specific hydrolase that cleaves chitosan polymers into oligomeric fingerprints, UHPLC-ESI-MS, and partial least squares regression (PLSR). We also developed a technique to simulate enzymatic fingerprints in silico that were used to build the PLS models for FA determination. Overall, we found our method to be as accurate as NMR while at the same time requiring only microgram amounts of sample. Thus the method represents a powerful technique for chitosan analysis.",

    "articleAbstract": "Fiber enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) is an arising new technique for versatile highly sensitive and selective multigas analysis in various applications, such as environmental monitoring and medical breath diagnosis. In this study, the performance of FERS was thoroughly studied with the help of a specially designed multichannel Raman chemical imaging. Several types of hollow core photonic crystal fibers were thoroughly analyzed in terms of their performance in light confinement and sensitive gas sensing. The optimal fiber length for Raman gas sensing was found to be 15 cm in our spectroscopic system. To separate the Raman scattering of the target gas molecules from the background generated by the silica microstructure of the fiber, the optimal diameter of a spatial filter was analyzed and quantified as Ø3.9 μm, which balances the suppression of the silica background and the attenuation of the gas signal, originating from different regions in the plane of the fiber end-face. To achieve an easy-to-use gas monitoring system with stable performance, an automated coupling-method was developed, to simplify the alignment of the FERS setup. The optimized design of the FERS setup has remarkable potential for highly sensitive, miniaturized, easy-to-use, and versatile gas sensing.",

    "articleAbstract": "Multiple-tracer approaches for investigating glucose metabolism in humans usually involve the administration of stable and radioactive glucose tracers and the subsequent determination of tracer enrichments in sampled blood. When using conventional, low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS), the number of spectral interferences rises rapidly with the number of stable tracers employed. Thus, in LRMS, both computational effort and statistical uncertainties associated with the correction for spectral interferences limit the number of stable tracers that can be simultaneously employed (usually two). Here we show that these limitations can be overcome by applying high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The HRMS method presented is based on the use of an Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at a mass resolution of 100000 to allow electrospray-generated ions of the deprotonated glucose molecules to be monitored at their exact masses. The tracer enrichment determination in blood plasma is demonstrated for several triple combinations of (13)C- and (2)H-labeled glucose tracers (e.g., [1-(2)H1]-, [6,6-(2)H2]-, [1,6-(13)C2]glucose). For each combination it is shown that ions arising from (2)H-labeled tracers are completely differentiated from those arising from (13)C-labeled tracers, thereby allowing the enrichment of a tracer to be simply calculated from the observed ion intensities using a standard curve with curve parameters unaffected by the presence of other tracers. For each tracer, the HRMS method exhibits low limits of detection and good repeatability in the tested 0.1-15.0% enrichment range. Additionally, due to short sample preparation and analysis times, the method is well suited for high-throughput determination of multiple glucose tracer enrichments in plasma samples.",

    "articleAbstract": "Black phosphorous (b-P), and more recently black phosphorous arsenic alloys (b-PAs), are candidate 2D materials for the detection of mid-wave and potentially long-wave infrared radiation. However, studies to date have utilized laser-based measurements to extract device performance and the responsivity of these detectors. As such, their performance under thermal radiation and spectral response has not been fully characterized. Here, we perform a systematic investigation of gated-photoconductors based on black phosphorous-arsenic alloys as a function of thickness over the composition range of 0% to 91% As. Infrared transmission and reflection measurements are performed to determine the bandgap of the various compositions. The spectrally resolved photoresponse for various compositions in this material system is investigated to confirm absorption measurements, and we find that the cut-off wavelength can be tuned from 3.9 μm to 4.6 μm over the studied compositional range. In addition, we investigated the temperature dependent photoresponse and performed calibrated responsivity measurements using blackbody flood illumination. Notably, we find that the specific detectivity (D*) can be optimized by adjusting the thickness of the b-P/b-PAs layer to maximize absorption and minimize dark current. We obtain a peak D* of 6×10(10) cm Hz(1/2) W(-1) and 2.4×10(10) cm Hz(1/2) W(-1) for pure b-P and b-PAs (91% As) respectively at room temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than commercially available mid-wave infrared detectors operating at room temperature.",

Remarkably, the exposed Lewis acid Cd(II) sites of activated 1 make it an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides at 1 and 20 atm. Importantly, the activated samples of 1 can be reused at least five circles with excellent catalytic performance.

Here, we report the application of a previously developed robotic screening platform, here extended to enable a multiplexed high-throughput cell partitioning analysis in ATPS. We investigated the influence of polymer molecular weight and tie-line length on the resolution of five model cell lines in \"charge-sensitive\" polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-dextran ATPS. We show, how these factors influence cell partitioning, and that the combination of low molecular weight PEGs and high molecular weight dextrans enable the highest resolution of the five cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability of each cell line from the mixture is highly dependent on the polymer molecular weight composition and tie-line length. Using a countercurrent distribution model we demonstrate that our screenings yielded conditions that theoretically enable the isolation of four of the five cell lines with high purity (>99.9%) and yield.",

This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with the presence of sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) using big data analytics.Using a case-control design, we evaluated the risk factors associated with the presence of SSAs and TSAs. Subjects who underwent colonoscopies from 2002 to 2012 as part of the comprehensive health screening programs undertaken at the Samsung Medical Center, South Korea, participated in this study.Of the 48,677 individuals who underwent colonoscopies, 183 (0.4%) had SSAs and 212 (0.4%) had TSAs. The multivariate analysis determined that being aged ≥50 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidential interval [CI] 1.27-2.90, P=0.002) and a history of CRC among first-degree relatives (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.57-6.27, P=0.001) were significant risk factors associated with the presence of SSAs, and that being aged ≥50 years (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.79-3.80, P<0.001), obesity (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.36, P=0.010), and a higher triglyceride level (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.36, P=0.010) were independent risk factors associated with the presence of TSAs.We used big data analytics to determine the risk factors associated with the presence of specific polyp subgroups, and individuals who have these risk factors should be carefully scrutinized for the presence of SSAs or TSAs during screening colonoscopies.",

    "articleAbstract": "Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD) and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) are two common pediatric hip disorders that affect the 3-dimensional shape and function of the proximal femur. This study applied the principles of continuum mechanics to statistical shape modeling (SSM) and determined 3-D metrics for the evaluation of shape deformations in normal growth, LCPD, and SCFE. CT scans were obtained from 32 patients with asymptomatic, LCPD, and SCFE hips ((0.5-0.9mm)(2) in-plane resolution, 0.63mm slice thickness). SSM was performed on segmented proximal femoral surfaces, and shape deformations were described by surface displacement, strain, and growth plate angle metrics. Asymptomatic normal femurs underwent coordinated, growth-associated surface displacements and anisotropic strains that were site-specific and highest at the greater trochanter. After size- and age-based shape adjustment, LCPD femurs exhibited large displacements and surface strains in the femoral head and neck, with associated changes in femoral head growth plate angles. Mild SCFE femurs had contracted femoral neck surfaces, and surface displacements in all regions tended to increase with severity of slip. The results of this paper provide new 3-D metrics for characterizing the shape and biomechanics of the proximal femur. Statement of Clinical Significance: Quantitative 3-D metrics of shape may be useful for understanding and monitoring disease progression, identifying target regions for shape modulation therapies, and objectively evaluating the success of such therapies.

These injection machines, together with their cargo of subversive effector proteins are capable of manipulating the cellular environment of the host in order to ensure persistence of the pathogen. In order to fully appreciate the functions of Type 3 effectors it is necessary to gain spatio-temporal knowledge of each effector during the process of infection. A number of genetic modifications have been exploited in order to reveal effector protein secretion, translocation and subsequent activity and localisation within host cells. In this review, we will discuss the many available approaches for tracking effector protein dynamics and discuss the challenges faced to improve the current technologies and gain a clearer picture of effector protein function.",

    "articleAbstract": "The California red-legged frog (CRLF), delta smelt (DS), and the California tiger salamander (CTS) are three species listed under the United States Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), all of which inhabit aquatic ecosystems in California. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has conducted deterministic screening-level risk assessments for these species potentially exposed to malathion, an organophosphorus insecticide and acaricide. Results from our screening-level analyses identified potential risk of direct effects to DS as well as indirect effects to all three species via reduction in prey. Accordingly, for those species and scenarios in which risk was identified at the screening-level, we conducted a refined probabilistic risk assessment for CRLF, DS, and CTS. The refined ERA was conducted using best available data and approaches, as recommended by the 2013 National Research Council (NRC) report Assessing Risks to Endangered and Threatened Species from Pesticides. Refined aquatic exposure models including the Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM), the Vegetative Filter Strip Modeling System (VFSMOD), the Variable Volume Water Model (VVWM), the Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS), and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were used to generate estimated exposure concentrations (EECs) for malathion based on worst-case scenarios in California. Refined effects analyses involved developing concentration-response curves for fish and species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Quantitative risk curves, field and mesocosm studies, surface water monitoring data, and incident reports were considered in a weight-of-evidence approach. Currently labeled uses of malathion are not expected to result in direct effects to CRLF, DS or CTS, or indirect effects due to effects on fish and invertebrate prey.

    "articleAbstract": "Research is limited on diet challenges to improve health. A short-term, vegan protein diet regimen nutritionally balanced in macronutrient composition compared to an omnivorous diet was hypothesized to improve metabolic measurements of blood sugar regulation, blood lipids, and amino acid metabolism.This randomized, cross-over, controlled vegan verses animal diet challenge was conducted on 21 (11 female,10 male) healthy participants. Fasting plasma was measured during a 3-day diet intervention for clinical biochemistry and metabonomics. Intervention diet plans met individual caloric needs. Meals were provided and supervised. Diet compliance was monitored.The vegan diet lowered triglycerides, insulin and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), bile acids, elevated magnesium levels, and changed branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism (p<0.05), potentiating insulin and blood sugar control after 48 hours. Cholesterol control improved significantly in the vegan verses omnivorous diets. Plasma amino acid and magnesium concentrations positively correlated with dietary amino acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and dietary fiber inversely correlated with insulin, HOMA-IR and triglycerides. Nutritional biochemistries, BCAAs, insulin and HOMA-IR were impacted by sexual dimorphism. A health-promoting, BCAA-associated metabolic signature was produced from a short-term, healthy, controlled, vegan diet challenge when compared with a healthy, controlled, omnivorous diet.

The operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS), postoperative duration of chest tube placement, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the groups.Surgeries were conducted successfully in all patients, and no mortality occurred during the perioperative period. The ERAS group had better VAS on the third postoperative day, shorter chest tube duration, and shorter length of hospital stay (P < 0.05). No differences between the groups in terms of operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, VAS on the first postoperative day, or complication rate were found (P > 0.05).ERAS using uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for NSCLC patients is safe and practicable, and could also reduce the length of hospital stay.",

    "articleAbstract": "Cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) are pre-emergence herbicides that inhibit anisotropic cell expansion resulting in a severely swollen and stunted growth phenotype. Resistance to group 21 CBIs, such as isoxaben, is conferred by missense mutations in CELLOSE SYNTHASE A (CesA) genes required for primary cell wall synthesis, concluding that this is their in vivo target.Herein, we show that grasses exhibit tolerance to group 21 CBIs and explore the mechanism of tolerance to isoxaben in the grass Brachypodium distachyon (L.). Comparative genomics failed to identify synonymous point mutations that have been found to confer isoxaben resistance in the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). Brachypodium did not metabolize (14) C-isoxaben. We next explored the role of grass-specific non-cellulosic cell wall components, specifically the hemicellulose polysaccharide mix linkage glucans (MLG), as a potential tolerance mechanism by compensating for the loss of cellulose during cell elongation. A partial-transcriptional knockdown T-DNA insertion was found in a key MLG synthesis gene, Cellulose synthase-like F6 (CslF6) and this mutant was found to be 2.1 times more sensitive to isoxaben than wild-type plants.These data suggest that the composition and compensatory response of grass cell walls may be a factor in conferring tolerance to group 21 CBIs.",

    "articleAbstract": "There are very few reports on the epidemiology of chronic hypoparathyroidism. A population-based study was undertaken to describe the prevalence and incidence of hypoparathyroidism in Tayside, Scotland. Data on biochemistry, hospital admissions, prescribing and death records in Tayside Scotland from 1988 to 2015 were linked electronically. Patients with at least three serum albumin corrected calcium concentrations below the reference range that were taken in an out-patient setting were included in the study. Patients with severe chronic kidney disease prior to low calcium were excluded from the study. Patients with hypocalcaemia were included if they had either previous neck surgery/irradiation, a low serum PTH or were treated with Vitamin D. Patients were identified as having either a post-surgical, a non-surgical cause, or had secondary hypoparathyroidism e.g. hypomagnesaemia. Overall 18,955 patients were identified with hypocalcaemia. Of these 222 patients had primary hypoparathyroidism, 116 with post-surgical and 106 with non-surgical chronic hypoparathyroidism. In 2015 the prevalence of primary hypoparathyroidism was 40 per 100,000, with a rate of 23 and 17 per 100,000 respectively for post-surgical and non-surgical. 80% of the former and 64% of the latter were female. The mean serum calcium at diagnosis was 1.82mmol/l (SD ± 0.24) and the annual incidence varied from 1-4 per 100,000. Overall, 71% of patients were prescribed Vitamin D and/or calcium, whilst activated Vitamin D was used in 48% of post-surgical cases and 43% of non-surgical cases. Thyroxine and/or hydrocortisone were prescribed in over 90% of post-surgical and 64% of non-surgical cases. In conclusion, the prevalence of non-surgical chronic hypoparathyroidism was greater than previously reported using this population-based approach. Many had mild hypocalcaemia and did not receive any treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "articleAbstract": "To study the local and systemic effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization, Nicotiana attenuata plants impaired in their interactions with AMF due to silencing of a calcium- and calmodulin dependent protein kinase (inverted repreat (ir)CCaMK) were grown competitively in pairs with empty vector (EV) plants, with and without two different types of inoculum. When inoculated, EV plants strongly outperformed irCCaMK plants. Foliar transcript profiling revealed that AMF colonization significantly changed gene expression of P-starvation and -transporter genes in irCCaMK plants. The Pht1 family phosphate transporter NaPT5 was not only specifically induced in roots after AMF colonization, but also in leaves of AMF-colonized irCCaMK plants, and in plants grown under low Pi conditions in the absence of AMF. The P-starvation signature of inoculated irCCaMK plants corresponded with increases in selected amino acids and phenolic compounds in leaves. We also found a strong AMF induced increase in amino acids and phenolic metabolites in roots. Plants impaired in their interactions with AMF clearly have a fitness disadvantage when competing for limited soil nutrients with a fully functional isogenic line. The additional role of the AMF-induced Pht1 family transporter NaPT5 in leaves under P-starvation conditions will require further experiments to fully resolve.",

    "articleAbstract": "There are few studies on the long-term efficacy of adalimumab treatment for patients with Crohn's disease. We have conducted a large, multicenter, retrospective cohort study to evaluate the long-term retention rate and prognostic factors associated with the discontinuation of adalimumab treatment in patients with Crohn's disease.Data were collected from all patients with Crohn's disease who had received at least one induction dose of 160 mg of adalimumab between October 2010 and December 2013 at 41 institutions. The cumulative retention rates of adalimumab treatment following the first administration were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors related to the cumulative retention rates were evaluated by log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression analysis.A total of 1189 patients were included in the study. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year cumulative retention rates of adalimumab were 81%, 72%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed female sex, previous infliximab use, perianal disease, concomitant treatment with prednisolone at baseline, higher C-reactive protein levels, and lower albumin levels as significant independent predictors of poor retention rate of adalimumab treatment. Significantly more female patients than males discontinued adalimumab because of adverse events, especially skin reactions, infections, and arthralgia.Our data demonstrated a good retention rate of adalimumab in patients with Crohn's disease over a 4-year period. Female sex, perianal disease, concomitant treatment with prednisolone at baseline, previous infliximab use, higher C-reactive protein levels, and lower albumin levels were associated with poor retention of adalimumab treatment.",

    "articleAbstract": "Salmonella typhimurium is commonly described as a food-borne pathogen. However, natural and drinking water are known to be important sources for the transmission of this pathogen in developing and developed countries. The standard method to determine Salmonella is laborious and many false positives are detected. To solve this, the present work was focused on the development of a capillary zone electrophoresis method coupled to ultraviolet detection for determination of Salmonella typhimurium in water (mineral and tap water). Separations were performed in less than 11 minutes using 4.5 mM Tris (hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, 4.5 mM boric acid and 0.1 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetate (pH 8.4) with 0.1% v/v poly ethylene oxide as separation buffer. The precision of the method was evaluated in terms of repeatability obtaining a relative standard deviation of 10.5%. Using the proposed method Salmonella typhimurium could be separated from other bacteria that could be present in water such as Escherichia coli. Finally, the proposed methodology was applied to determine Salmonella typhimurium in tap and mineral water. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "articleAbstract": "Osteocyte processes are an order of magnitude more sensitive to mechanical loading than their cell bodies. The mechanisms underlying this remarkable mechanosensitivity are not clear, but may be related to the infrequent αVβ3 integrin sites where the osteocyte cell processes attach to canalicular walls. These sites develop dramatically elevated strains during load-induced fluid flow in the lacunar-canalicular system and were recently shown to be primary sites for osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cell mechanotransduction. These αVβ3 integrin sites lack typical integrin transduction mechanisms. Rather, stimulation at these sites alters Ca(2+) signaling, ATP release and membrane potential. In the current studies, we tested the hypothesis that in authentic osteocytes in situ, key membrane proteins implicated in osteocyte mechanotransduction are preferentially localized at or near to β3 integrin-foci. We analyzed these spatial relationships in mouse bone osteocytes using immunohistochemistry combined with Structured Illumination Super Resolution Microscopy, a method that permits structural resolution at near electron microscopy levels in tissue sections. We discovered that the purinergic channel pannexin1, the ATP-gated purinergic receptor P2X7R and the low voltage transiently opened T-type calcium channel CaV3.2-1 all reside in close proximity to β3 integrin attachment foci on osteocyte processes, suggesting a specialized mechanotransduction complex at these sites. We further confirmed this observation on isolated osteocytes in culture using STochasitc Optical Resonance Microscopy. These findings identify a possible structural basis for the unique mechanosensation and transduction capabilities of the osteocyte process. This article is protected by copyright.

    "articleAbstract": "The control of the container-inhabiting mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is difficult with conventional methods due to its selection of cryptic peridomestic habitats. We evaluated whether autodissemination stations are able to deliver sufficient pyriproxyfen to sentinel containers to produce significant pupal mortality in different habitats such as competing oviposition sites, peridomestic habitats, junk yards and tire piles. We also tested how far the pesticide could be transferred over a 200 m range.Autodissemination stations performed effectively for 8-12 weeks under field conditions. Pupal mortality was reduced in sentinel cups with high competing oviposition habitats (5 Vs 20) in isolated plots, however, similar results were not seen in residential areas. Increasing the number of stations per plot (from 1 to 4) enhanced the efficacy. Peridomestic habitat trials showed the highest pupal mortality (50.4%) and site contamination with pyriproxyfen (82.2%) among the trials. Autodissemination stations were able to contaminate habitats in a junk yard (50.0%) and tire piles (40.2%). Pyriproxyfen was detected in sentinel cups up to 200m from stations. Detection of pyriproxyfen by residue analysis (0.005 to 0.741 μg L(-1) ) in field samples confirmed the transfer of the insect growth regulator.Autodissemination stations have shown promising potential as a novel pest management tool against container mosquitoes in field trials in different habitats confronted by mosquito control personnel.",

    "articleAbstract": "Non-surgical hypoparathyroidism (Ns-HypoPT) and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) are both rare diseases, characterized by hypocalcemia. In Ns-HypoPT, PTH levels are low, whereas patients with PHP often have very high levels due to receptor-insensitivity to PTH (PTH-resistance). Accordingly, we hypothesized that indices of bone turnover and bone mineralization/architecture are similar in Ns-HypoPT and PHP despite marked differences in PTH levels. We studied 62 patients with Ns-HypoPT and 31 with PHP as well as a group of age- and sex matched healthy controls. We found a significantly higher areal BMD by DXA among patients with Ns-HypoPT, both compared with PHP and the background population. Compared with Ns-HypoPT, PHP patients had significantly lower total and trabecular volumetric BMD assessed by QCT scans at the spine and hip. HRpQCT-scans, showed a lower trabecular area and volumetric BMD as well as a lower trabecular number at the tibia in PHP compared to Ns-HypoPT and matched controls. In PHP, PTH levels correlated with levels of markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, P1NP), and bone resorption (CTx). In adult males, levels of bone markers were significantly higher in PHP compared with Ns-HypoPT. Levels of procalcitonin and calcitonin were significantly higher in PHP compared with Ns-HypoPT. In conclusion, indices of bone turnover, density, and microarchitecture differ between patients with Ns-HypoPT and PHP. Our data suggest that patients with PHP do not have a complete skeletal resistance to PTH and that the effects of chronically high PTH levels in PHP are mostly confined to the trabecular tissue.

Here, the aim was to highlight differences between the proteomic response of the roots of two potato cultivars contrasting in their response to nitrogen deficiency, in an effort to understand which proteins and metabolic pathways contribute to the tolerance of N deprivation. The two cultivars 'Topas' (tolerant) and 'Lambada' (sensitive) were grown under both an N sufficient and an N deficient regime, using an in vitro- based cultivation system. Responsive proteins were identified and quantified using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics. The contrasting cultivars differed with respect to components of the glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway as well as protein and amino acid synthesis machinery. Additional differences were associated with protein catabolism and defense mechanisms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "articleAbstract": "To identify viewpoints among men with depression about depression and its treatment, consider how these might influence help-seeking behaviour, and generate ideas for interventions and future research.Q methodology.Twenty-nine men with depression completed a Q sort by ranking a set of statements about depression and help-seeking according to their relative agreement with each statement. Factor analysis was used to identify viewpoints relating to male understandings of depression and help-seeking, which were interpreted in the context of participant characteristics and additional information from post-sorting interviews.A two-factor solution accounting for 45% of the total variance was considered the best fit for the data. The 2 factors were: (1) Help is available if you can get to the point of asking for it (34% of the variance) and (2) depression should be dealt with in private; help-seeking makes you vulnerable (11% of the variance). Participants who were significantly associated with both factors described a sense of shame, relating to their own or others' views that being depressed and help-seeking are in conflict with socially constructed 'masculine' values, such as strength and self-sufficiency. In the viewpoint represented by Factor 1, however, the benefits of help-seeking outweigh the negatives. In contrast, the viewpoint represented in Factor 2 holds that depression should remain a private struggle and that help-seeking is too risky a move to make.In order to access treatment, men must first recognize depression, then overcome considerable perceived and internalized stigma to ask for help. Improving public knowledge about the nature of depression; positive messages about the act of help-seeking, types of treatment available, and effectiveness of treatments; and work to overcome the challenges posed by long waiting times and other service constraints may increase rates of help-seeking, and represent areas for future research.Interventions to improve recognition of depression symptoms, particularly in the absence of recent negative life events or suicidal ideation, might help to improve help-seeking rates among men. Media campaigns should consider focusing on the positive elements of help-seeking and potential for recovery, and the impact of such campaigns should be evaluated. Improving public knowledge of the types of non-medical intervention that are available for depression may help to increase help-seeking rates. Clinical services and commissioners should be aware of the impact of long waiting times and strict discharge policies on service users, especially those who have difficulty asking for help.",

    "articleAbstract": "The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury, and dehydration. In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with 1 CBD (CPAP1s), 9 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with 3 CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), 4 chitinases, and 3 chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Q-PCR and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20E treatment. These results provide a genome-level view of the chitin-binding protein in silkworm and suggest that BmCBP1 participates in the formation of the new cuticle during molting.

Adding a small amount of ionic liquids significantly shortens the separation time and improves the separation efficiency. The conditions of ionic-liquid-modified high-speed countercurrent chromatography including solvent systems, types and content of added ionic liquids, and ionic liquids post-treatment were investigated. The established method was successfully applied to separate alkaloids from lotus leaves using a two-phase solvent system composed of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/methanol/water/[C4 mim][BF4 ] (1:5:1:5:0.15, v/v). Four alkaloids pronuciferine (1.7 mg), N-nornuciferine (4.3 mg), nuciferine (3.1 mg), and roemerine (2.1 mg) were obtained with the purities of 90.53, 92.25, 99.86 and 98.63%, respectively from 100 mg crude extract of lotus leaves. The results indicated that ionic-liquid-modified high-speed countercurrent chromatography method was suitable for alkaloid separation from lotus leaves and would be a promising method for the separation of alkaloids from other natural products.

    "articleAbstract": "Altered glucose metabolism has been found in a variety of malignant diseases and recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer. However, the molecular mechanism behind it is far from well understood. In current study, we found silencer of death domains (SODD) regulates glucose uptake of colorectal cancer cells. When cultured under low level of glucose, SODD overexpressing RKO and SW1417 cells generated more colonies, compared with control cells, in clonogenic assay. SODD upregulation enhanced RKO and SW1417 cells viability. Furthermore, SODD induced more GLUT1 (Glucose transporter 1) expression and enhanced glucose uptake. AKT phosphorylation was upregulated in SODD overexpression cells. Moreover, inhibition of GLUT1 or AKT could reverse SODD induced glucose uptake enhancement. In conclusion, our findings indicate that SODD positively regulates glucose uptake and may be a potential therapeutic target of colorectal cancer.",

    "articleAbstract": "Ischemic cerebral stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability world-wide. Neuronal injury following cerebral ischemia initiates a complex series of signaling cascades that lead to neuronal cell death. MicroRNA 29b (miR-29b) has reported involvement in the pathogenic process of ischemic brain injury. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a highly selective α2 adrenergic receptor stimulant that exerts a protective effect on brain tissue. To determine whether Dex might directly influence miR-29b expression after an ischemic injury, human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for the purpose of creating a neuronal injury model that mimics the effects of brain ischemia in vitro. Next, the association of miR-29b with the protective effect of Dex against ischemic brain injury was studied through the enhancement or inhibition of miR-29b expression by transfection with an miR-29b mimic or inhibitor. We demonstrated that Dex treatment could reduce miR-29b expression, increase cell viability, and inhibit cell apoptosis in the OGD-induced neuronal injury model in vitro. Furthermore, down-regulation of miR-29b expression produced effects on OGD-induced neuronal injuries that were similar to those produced by Dex treatment. Moreover, up-regulation of miR-29b reversed the protective effect of Dex treatment against OGD-induced neuronal injury. Therefore, down-regulation of miR-29b expression might play a role in anti-apoptotic signaling similar to that played by Dex. Elucidation of the role played by miR-29b in ischemia, and identification of a definite association between Dex and miR-29b may lead to the development of new strategies for treating ischemic brain injuries.",

One reason for this failure is that the majority of pre clinical outcome measurements emphasise structural changes, such as gross morphology and histology, and do not address pain or its alleviation, which is a key component of treatment success in man. With increasing emphasis on 'patient reported outcome measurements (PROM)' in clinical practice, in this study we have used two different telemetric methods (geolocation and Fitbark activity trackers) to measure movement behaviour, i.e. an indirect PROM, in an ovine osteoarthritis induction and an osteochondral defect model performed in adult female Welsh Mountain sheep. This study demonstrates that both systems can be used to track movement and activity of experimental sheep before and after surgery and that the Geolocator system recorded a decrease in distance moved and activity at the end of the experimental period in both models. The Fitbark activity tracker also recorded significant alterations in movement behaviour at the end of these studies and this method of recording showed a correlation between Fitbark data and radiography, macroscopic and histological scoring (well recognised outcome measurements), particularly in animals with large (10mm) defects i.e. more severe pathology. These results suggest that telemetry is able to track movement behaviour in experimental sheep and that the methodology should be considered for inclusion in outcome measures in preclinical orthopaedic research.

In this context, 3T3 feeder layer cells (mouse embryo fibroblast) are generally utilized to maintain and expand LSCs. The aim of this study is to develop a novel culture method (animal-derived products free) to expand LSCs, using umbilical cord derived human unrestricted somatic stem cells (hUSSCs) instead of 3T3 cell with an emphasis on maintaining of the Stemness in LSCs. Using flow-cytometer, isolated hUSSCs were characterized for CD105, CD90, CD166, CD34, CD45, CD31 cell surface markers and their differentiation capability into adipogenic as well as osteogenic lineages were evaluated. In addition to colony-forming efficiency (CFE), epithelial lineage differentiation and karyotyping, LSC properties were evaluated for ABCG2, ΔNP63-α, CK19, CK3 and CK12 mRNA and protein expressions using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry, when these cells were co-cultured with hUSSCs (in comparison with 3T3 feeder layer). LSCs, co-cultured with hUSSCs, showed normal karyotype (46, XX), while they could efficiently form colony (86 ± 3) and display up-regulation of the genes associated with stemness and down-regulation of corneal epithelial differentiation genes. Consistent with 3T3 feeder cells, hUSSCs with spindle-shaped morphology and quick splitting up properties had ability to preserve the stem like-cell phenotype of LSCs. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR and flow-cytometer. Findings of present study suggest hUSSCs as a promising alternative method for 3T3 feeder layer cells, to preserve growth and stemness of LSCs ex vivo culture.",

The current study extends this scant literature by assessing whether racial/ethnic differences in heavy drinking have changed over time (possibly accounting for mixed findings from prior research); and tests for an age-crossover effect in heavy drinking using longitudinal data from two cohorts born 20 years apart.Data are from the 1979 (n=10,963) and 1997 (n=8,852) cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Generalized estimating equations were used to model trajectories of heavy drinking frequency from ages 17-31. Racial/ethnic differences were determined using sex-stratified models and three-way interactions of race/ethnicity with age, age-squared and cohort.Racial/ethnic differences in heavy drinking trajectories have changed over time in men and women. In the older NLSY cohort, Hispanic men and Black women surpassed White men's and women's heavy drinking frequency by age 31. This crossover was absent in the younger cohort, where trajectories of all racial-sex groups converged by age 31. Normative trajectories have changed in Hispanics and Whites of both sexes, with a delay in age of peak frequency, and greater levels of heavy drinking in the younger cohort of women.Changes in heavy drinking trajectories over time suggest the need for targeted interventions during young adulthood. While disparities in young adult heavy drinking were no longer apparent in the more recent birth cohort, continued monitoring is important. This article is protected by copyright.

The small number of dogs that were seronegative for one or more of the antigens (n = 31) may have had waning of previous serum antibody or may have been rare genetic non-responders to that specific antigen.UK veterinarians can be reassured that triennial revaccination of adult dogs with core vaccines provides long-lived protective immunity. In-practice serological test kits are a valuable tool for informing decision-making about canine core revaccination.",

    "articleAbstract": "It is estimated that over 300,000 total hip replacements are performed each year in the USA. For European countries, the number of hip replacement procedures per 100,000 people performed in 2007 varied from less than 50 to over 250. To facilitate postoperative rehabilitation, pain must be adequately treated. Peripheral nerve blocks and neuraxial blocks have been proposed to replace or supplement systemic analgesia.We aimed to compare the relative effects (benefits and harms) of the different nerve blocks that may be used to relieve pain after elective hip replacement in adults.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1946 to December Week 49, 2016), Embase (Ovid SP) (1980 to December week 49, 2016), CINAHL (EBSCO host) (1982 to 6 December 2016), ISI Web of Science (1973 to 6 December 2016), Scopus (from inception to December 2016), trials registers, and relevant web sites.We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in adults undergoing elective primary hip replacement and comparing peripheral nerve blocks to any other pain treatment modality. We applied no language or publication status restrictions.Data were extracted independently by two review authors. We contacted study authors.We included 51 RCTs with 2793 participants; of these 45 RCTs (2491 participants: peripheral nerve block = 1288; comparators = 1203) were included in meta-analyses. There are 11 ongoing studies and three awaiting classification.Compared to systemic analgesia alone, peripheral nerve blocks reduced: pain at rest on arrival in the postoperative care unit (SMD -1.12, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.56; 9 trials, 429 participants; equivalent to 3.2 on 0 to 10 scale; moderate-quality evidence); risk of acute confusional status: risk ratio (RR) 0.10 95% CI 0.02 to 0.54; 1 trial, 225 participants; number needed to treat for additional benefit (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 11 to 22; very low-quality evidence); pruritus (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.70; 2 trials, 259 participants for continuous peripheral nerve blocks; NNTB 4 (95% CI 4 to 8); very low-quality evidence); hospital length of stay (SMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.48; very low-quality evidence; 2 trials, 249 participants; equivalent to 0.75 day). Participant satisfaction increased (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89; low-quality evidence; 5 trials, 363 participants; equivalent to 2.4 on 0 to 10 scale). We did not find a difference for the number of participants walking on postoperative day one (very low-quality evidence). Two nerve block-related complications were reported: one local haematoma and one delayed persistent paresis.Compared to neuraxial blocks, peripheral nerve blocks reduced the risk of pruritus (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.58; 6 trials, 299 participants; moderate-quality evidence; NNTB 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We did not find a difference for pain at rest on arrival in the postoperative care unit (moderate-quality evidence); number of nerve block-related complications (low-quality evidence); acute confusional status (very low-quality evidence); hospital length of stay (low quality-evidence); time to first walk (low-quality evidence); or participant satisfaction (high-quality evidence).We found that peripheral nerve blocks provide better pain control compared to systemic analgesia with no major differences between peripheral nerve blocks and neuraxial blocks. We also found that peripheral nerve blocks may be associated with reduced risk of postoperative acute confusional state and a modest reduction in hospital length of stay that could be meaningful in terms of cost reduction considering the increasing numbers of procedures performed annually.Compared to systemic analgesia alone, there is moderate-quality evidence that peripheral nerve blocks reduce postoperative pain, low-quality evidence that patient satisfaction is increased and very low-quality evidence for reductions in acute confusional status, pruritus and hospital length of stay .We found moderate-quality evidence that peripheral nerve blocks reduce pruritus compared with neuraxial blocks.The 11 ongoing studies, once completed, and the three studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.",

    "articleAbstract": "In photobiocatalytical processes involving the simultaneous oxidation of water and reduction of specific organic molecules (e.g., cofactors), the lack of physical separation of the redox half-reactions adversely affects the product stability. This is largely because organic molecules are generally less stable within harsh oxidative environments. In general, surface co-catalysts are able to improve the selectivity of photocatalysts towards water oxidation. However, harsh oxidative environments reduce the chemical stability of the organic molecules. Herein, we show that the use of Co3O4 as a surface co-catalyst on silver orthophosphate improve water photo-oxidation in the presence of organic dye molecules, such as methylene blue, that typically exhibits susceptibility toward photodegradation. The presence of Co3O4 on the photocatalyst surface prevents the adsorption of the organic dye, thus reducing its degradation rate. These findings provide a promising scenario for the visible light-driven reduction of organic molecules using water as an electron donor.",

The photo-induced carrier temperature is extracted from transient absorption spectra and monitored as a function of time delay. The cooling dynamics of carriers in PbS QDs suggest a reduction of the carrier energy loss rate at longer time delays through the retardation of the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon decay due to partial heating of acoustic phonon modes. A slowed hot carrier cooling time up to 116 ps is observed in the drop cast film. A faster cooling rate was also observed in the highly compact Langmuir-Blodgett film due to the enhanced carrier-LO phonon coupling strength arising from the Coulombic interaction in neighboring QDs, which is verified by temperature dependent steady state PL measurements.",

    "articleAbstract": "The insertion of suitable metals or high Z elements in tumour-avid tetrapyrrole compounds is a promising approach to obtain potential agents for multimodal cancer therapeutics and tumour imaging. Using chlorin p6, a chlorophyll derivative, we synthesized a novel iodinated chlorin p6-copper complex (ICp6-Cu) that can be applied to the photodynamic therapy and photon activation therapy of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of ICp6-Cu with human serum albumin (HSA) using UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The addition of HSA to ICp6-Cu at physiological pH led to a ∼7 nm red shift in its Soret and Q band absorption. The binding constant (Kb) and the number of binding sites (n) of ICp6-Cu obtained from the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA were 2.9 × 10(6) M(-1) and 1.2 respectively. The distance between the Trp-214 residue and ICp6-Cu computed from Förster non-radiative energy transfer (FRET) theory was 3.1 nm. The emission of the ICp6-Cu fluorescence when excited at the protein's Trp absorption (295 nm) further substantiated the FRET between the Trp residue and ICp6-Cu. Synchronous spectroscopy revealed that the quenching of protein Trp fluorescence was higher than that of Tyr with no significant shift in peak position. Results suggested that HSA acts as a carrier protein for ICp6-Cu with a high probability that the binding of ICp6-Cu occurred at subdomain IIA and the binding had no effect on the conformation of HSA.",

In this study, both rheology and small angle neutron scattering (RheoSANS) were used to measure changes in flow-oriented order parameter and viscosity as a function of shear rate for isotropic, biphasic, liquid crystalline, and gel dispersions of CNC in deuterium oxide (D2O). In contrast to plots of viscosity versus shear rate, the order parameter trends showed three distinct rheological regions over a range of concentrations. This finding is significant because the existence of three rheological regions as a function of shear rate is a long-standing signature of liquid crystalline phases composed of rod-like polymers, but observing this trend has been elusive for high-concentration dispersions of anisotropic nanomaterials. The results of this work are valuable for guiding the development of processing methodologies for producing ordered materials from CNC dispersions and the broader class of chiral nanomaterial mesogens.",

    "articleAbstract": "Promising new antimalarial agents were investigated using FT-NIR and deep-UV resonance Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of the seven arylisoquinolines (AIQ) were calculated with the help of density functional theory (DFT). Very good agreement with the experimental data was achieved and a convincing mode assignment was performed with the help of the calculated potential energy distribution (PED). For the non-resonant Raman spectra the most prominent bands were assigned to ν(C[double bond, length as m-dash]C) stretching modes of the isoquinoline system. To differentiate between substances with similar structures, deep-UV resonance Raman spectra were recorded. Raman bands in the range between 1250 and 1210 cm(-1) were assigned to ν(C[double bond, length as m-dash]C) stretching vibrations in combination with δ(HCC) deformation vibrations of the aryl rests. These vibrations of the aryl part of the molecules were selectively enhanced, which, thus, enabled the differentiation of similar active agents from each other. For λexc = 257 nm excitation, strong ν(C[double bond, length as m-dash]C) vibrations of the isoquinoline (benzo-) part dominate the Raman spectrum in the range between 1685 and 1585 cm(-1) and for λexc = 244 nm the Raman signals between 1430 and 1350 cm(-1) were enhanced and assigned to ν(C[double bond, length as m-dash]C) of the isoquinoline (pyridino-) system.",

    "articleAbstract": "We demonstrate a new class of nanostructured topological materials that exhibit a topological quantum phase arising from nanoscale structural motifs. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that an array of bismuth nanotubes (Bi-NTs), a superlattice of Bi-NTs with periodicity in the order of tube diameter, behaves as a nanostructured two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator, as confirmed from the calculated band topology and 1D helical edge states. The underpinning mechanism of the QSH phase in the Bi-NT array is revealed to be inversion of bonding-antibonding levels of molecular orbitals of constituent nanostructural elements in place of atomic-orbital band inversion in conventional QSH insulators. The quantized edge conductance of the QSH phase in a Bi-NT array can be more easily isolated from bulk contributions and their properties can be highly tuned by tube size, representing distinctive advantages of nanostructured topological phases. Our finding opens a new avenue for topological materials by extending topological phases into nanomaterials with molecular-orbital-band inversion.",

    "articleAbstract": "Although recent years have witnessed considerable progress in the synthesis of metal clusters, there is still a paucity of reports on photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of metal cluster/semiconductor systems for solar energy conversion. In this work, highly ordered glutathione (GSH)-protected gold (Au) cluster (Aux@GSH) enwrapped ZnO nanowire array (NW) heterostructures (Aux/ZnO NWs) were designed by a facile, green, simple yet efficient in situ etching-induced electrostatic self-assembly strategy by modulating the intrinsic surface charge properties of building blocks, which renders negatively charged Aux clusters spontaneously and uniformly self-assembles them on positively charged ZnO NWs framework with intimate interfacial integration. It was unraveled that such Aux/ZnO NWs heterostructures demonstrated significantly enhanced PEC water splitting performance in comparison with single ZnO NWs, Au nanoparticles (Au/ZnO NWs) and GSH-capped Agx clusters (Agx/ZnO NWs) decorated ZnO NWs counterparts under both simulated solar and visible light irradiation. The vitally important role of Aux clusters as photosensitizer was unambiguously revealed and the merits of Aux clusters in boosting charge transfer arising from their unique core-shell architecture were highlighted by systematic comparison under identical conditions, based on which Aux cluster-mediated PEC water splitting mechanism is delineated. It is anticipated that our work can highlight the possibility of harnessing metal clusters as efficient light-harvest antennas and open new avenues for rational construction of various highly energy efficient metal cluster/semiconductor heterostructures for widespread photocatalytic and PEC applications.",

    "articleAbstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanostructures have been widely used as catalysts in the petroleum refinery industry for the hydrodesulfurization process, in which sulfur vacancies play a critical role in determining the catalytic activity. Here we report size effects and odd-even effects on the formation of sulfur vacancies in the triangular MoS2 nanosheets using first-principles calculations. By modeling four types of edge structures of MoS2 nanosheets, S-terminated edges are found to be energetically more favorable than Mo-terminated edges, and are then selected for studying energetics of sulfur vacancies. Two types of sulfur dimer vacancies at the center (VS@Cen) and at the corner (VS@Cnr) of the edges of S-terminated MoS2 nanosheets are modeled, respectively. Our results reveal a strong odd-even effect on the formation of sulfur dimer vacancies, particularly for small MoS2 nanosheets, in terms of the size of nanosheets that is defined by the number of Mo atoms on the edge. The VS@Cen dimer vacancy has a low formation energy at an even-number but a high formation energy at an odd-number, while the VS@Cnr dimer vacancy exhibits a complete opposite trend. These results indicate that small MoS2 nanosheets can exhibit unique material properties for catalytic applications.",

The form of the t-J like effective Hamiltonian has been inspired by the acquired DFT data, and the valence state used in DFT calculations has been suggested by the fits to the experimental magnetic data with the effective Hamiltonian. This self-consistent approach breaks through the magnetochemical limitations of vanadium-oxo cluster 1, giving results fully concordant with the experiment and allowing us to determine the valence state of 1, which contrary to other members of this host-guest family appears to feature 9 valence electrons.",

    "articleAbstract": "The BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins (BRDs) is believed to be a promising drug target for therapeutic intervention in a number of diseases including cancer, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. Hence, there is a great demand for novel chemotypes of BET inhibitors. The drug repurposing strategy offers great benefits to find inhibitors with known safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, thus increasing medicinal chemists' interest in recent years. Using the drug repurposing strategy, a BRD4-specific score based virtual screening campaign on an in-house drug library was conducted followed by the ALPHA screen assay test. Nitroxoline, an FDA-approved antibiotic, was identified to effectively disrupt the interaction between the first bromodomain of BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) and acetylated H4 peptide with IC50 of 0.98 μM. Nitroxoline inhibited all BET family members with good selectivity against non-BET bromodomain-containing proteins, thus it is defined as a selective BET inhibitor. Based on the crystal structure of the nitroxoline-BRD4_BD1 complex, the mechanism of action as well as BET specificity of nitroxoline were determined. Since the anticancer activity of nitroxoline against MLL leukemia, one of the BET related diseases, has not been studied before, we tested whether nitroxoline might serve as a potential repurposing drug candidate for MLL leukemia. Nitroxoline effectively inhibited the proliferation of MLL leukemia cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The profound efficacy is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of BET and downregulation of target gene transcription. Our discovery of nitroxoline as a BET inhibitor suggests potential application of nitroxoline and its derivatives for clinical translation in BET family related diseases.",

Here we report a distinct transportation characteristic achieved by actively coupling the carriers with randomly distributed lattice-dipoles for strain-distorted SrNbxTi1-xO3. The strong electron correlations split the conduction band, and lead to a distinguished thermal-emitted carrier transportation with an activation energy of ∼10(-2) eV. Further consistency was demonstrated by the respective changes in orbital configurations observed in near edge X-ray absorption fine structures. The present investigation demonstrates new mechanisms for regulating the carrier transportation using polaronic electron correlations.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nanoscopic pores are used in various systems to attract nanoparticles. In general the behaviour is a result of two types of interactions: the material specific affinity and the solvent-mediated influence also called the depletion force. The latter is more universal but also much more complex to understand since it requires modeling both the nanoparticle and the solvent. Here, we employed classical density functional theory to determine the forces acting on a nanoparticle near a nanoscopic pore as a function of its hydrophobicity and its size. A simple capillary model is constructed to predict those depletion forces for various surface properties. For a nanoscopic pore, complexity arises from both the specific geometry and the fact that hydrophobic pores are not necessarily filled with liquid. Taking all of these effects into account and including electrostatic effects, we establish a phase diagram describing the entrance and the rejection of the nanoparticle from the pore.",

    "articleAbstract": "In this study, a new (99m)Tc(iii) complex [(99m)TcCl(CDO)(CDOH)2B-3C] ((99m)Tc-3Cboroxime: CDOH2 = cyclohexanedione dioxime; 3C-B(OH)2 = 3-(carbamoylphenyl)boronic acid) was evaluated as a radiotracer for heart imaging. (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime was prepared in high radiochemical purity (RCP > 95%). Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed using Sprague-Dawley rats (200-225 g). We found that the heart uptake of (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime (3.43 ± 0.11%ID g(-1)) at 2 min postinjection (p.i.) was close to that of (99m)Tc-Teboroxime (3.00 ± 0.37%ID g(-1)), and the heart uptake value of (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime was almost unchanged over the first 15 min (3.05 ± 0.35%ID g(-1) at 15 min p.i.). (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime had lower uptake than (99m)Tc-Teboroxime in the blood, lungs and muscle over a 60 min period. Its heart/blood, heart/lung and heart/muscle ratios were better than those of (99m)Tc-Teboroxime. These results suggest that (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime has a significant advantage over (99m)Tc-Teboroxime with respect to myocardial retention and heart/background ratios. However, its liver uptake at 2 min p.i. was higher than that of (99m)Tc-Teboroxime. Because of its faster liver clearance, (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime had heart/liver ratios close to or better than that of (99m)Tc-Teboroxime at ≥5 min p.i. As a result, good quality SPECT images could be obtained in any of the 5 min imaging windows over the first 20 min after injection of (99m)Tc-3Cboroxime. More importantly, the results from this study show that the use of the 3-carbamylphenyl group is an interesting approach to achieve long heart retention for new (99m)Tc(iii) radiotracers. Future research will focus on further minimizing liver radioactivity while maintaining high heart uptake over a wide time window.",

    "articleAbstract": "This study seeks to determine the objective and subjective success rates of anterior palatoplasty and its variants for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). A systematic review with two independent searches of Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library and Evidence Based Medicine Reviews was performed to identify publications relevant to OSA and anterior palatoplasty. All relevant studies published before 30 June 2015 were included. Six studies were included in the systematic review. The numbers of patients in each paper ranged from 13 to 77 (total=240), and mean age ranged from 21 to 51 years. Substantial and consistent improvement in polysomnography (PSG) outcomes were observed in patients after the anterior palatoplasty, with or without multilevel surgery. The results showed that the anterior palatoplasty technique provides significantly improvement in the post-operative AHI. The mean pre-operative AHI (in the 6 papers) improved from 16.3 to 7.1, the snore visual analogue scale improved from 7.5 to 3.1 and the Epworth score reduced from 11.3 to 7.3 post-operatively. The overall pro-rated pooled success rate for all the patients was 72.5%, with a mean follow-up of 17.3 months. Anterior palatoplasty is an effective option in the management of patients with mild to moderate OSA.",

There is limited literature addressing nerve function and vein patency following treatment. We prospectively analysed 65 patients with nerve conduction study using surface electromyography at baseline, 1 month and 6 months post-surgery and colour Doppler of the internal jugular vein at baseline and 1 month post-surgery. We also studied functional outcomes of nerve sparing with arm abduction test and Neck Dissection Quality of Life questionnaire. There was a statistically significant increase in mean latency of motor action potential and decrease in the mean amplitude of the motor action potential following surgery, suggesting nerve dysfunction. Following surgery, there was a significant decrease in the diameter of the vein as well as an increase in the velocity of blood flow; there was partial thrombus in 5% of individuals. In conclusion, even though nerve dysfunction compromised shoulder abduction, vein dysfunction rarely resulted in any significant clinical impact.",

The aim of our study is to examine modifications in clinical and laboratory growth and immunological parameters and food intake changes in OSAS children after surgery. Twenty-eight children with severe OSAS associated with adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy were submitted to paediatric evaluation to calculate auxologic parameters (weight, height, BMI and standard deviation scores), a blood draw to evaluate growth (GH; IGF-1) and immunological parameters (IgG; IgA; IgM) and a dietitian evaluation to calculate caloric intake before and after 3 months following adeno-tonsillectomy. Mean height and weight values in the study group were slightly inferior to same-age children mean according to the percentile values. After surgery, both height and BMI increased significantly at 3-months follow-up: mean height increased 2.93 cm (p = 0.0001); BMI values greatly increased by 0.72 kg/m2 (p = 0.009). Standard deviation scores increased significantly for height (p = 0.03), weight (p = 0.001) and BMI (p = 0.001). These values significantly increased, despite almost unchanged caloric intake between the pre- and post-surgery period (90 ± 24 vs 91 ± 27 kcal/kg/day; p > 0.05). In all children, age-related GH values were normal and did not show any significant increase, while IGF-1 values significantly increased during the study period (p = 0.01). Regarding immunological parameters, only IgA levels decreased after surgery and maintained a value that was higher than normal (> 70 mg/dL). In conclusion, children affected by adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSAS do not show significant growth delay, but they do experience a slowdown in growth rate. After adeno-tonsillectomy, the speed of growth soon increases, as weight and growth increase notwithstanding an unchanged food intake. Moreover, surgery does not cause reduction in the efficiency of the immune system.",

The 3DP model was used to detect the most suitable location for the BB. A 3DP transparent mask that faithfully reproduced the surface of both the temporal bone and the 3DP model was also developed to correctly transfer the designated BB area. The accuracy of the procedure was verified by CT scan: a radiological marker was used to evaluate the degree of correspondence of the transducer site between the 3DP model and the human temporal bone. The BB positioning was successfully performed on all human temporal bones, with no difficulties in finding the proper location of the transducer. A mean error of 0.13 mm was found when the transducer site of the 3DP model was compared to that of the human temporal bone. The employment of 3D printing technology in surgical planning of BB positioning showed feasible results. Further studies will be required to evaluate its clinical applicability.",

    "articleAbstract": "Patients with celiac disease are at increased risk for infections such as tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumococcal pneumonia. However, little is known about the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients with celiac disease.We identified patients with celiac disease based on intestinal biopsies submitted to all pathology departments in Sweden over a 39-year period (from July 1969 through February 2008). We compared risk of CDI (based on stratified Cox proportional hazards models) among patients with celiac disease vs. without celiac disease (controls) matched by age, sex, and calendar period.We identified 28,339 patients with celiac disease and 141,588 controls; neither group had a history of CDI. The incidence of CDI was 56/100,000 person-years among patients with celiac disease and 26/100,000 person-years among controls, yielding an overall hazard ratio (HR) of 2.01 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.64-2.47; P<0.0001). The risk of CDI was highest in the first 12 months after diagnosis of celiac disease (HR, 5.20; 95% CI, 2.81-9.62; P<0.0001), but remained high, compared to that of controls, 1-5 years after diagnosis (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.22-2.81; P=0.004). Among 493 patients with CDI, antibiotic data were available for 251; there were no significant differences in prior exposures to antibiotics between patients with celiac disease and controls.In a large population-based cohort study, patients with celiac disease had significantly higher incidence of CDI than controls. This finding is consistent with prior findings of higher rates of other infections in patients with celiac disease, and suggests the possibility of altered gut immunity and/or microbial composition in patients with celiac disease.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.400.",

Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination (LDV/SOF FDC) for 12 weeks has been shown to be effective for multiple HCV genotypes including treatment-naïve HCV-6. Our goal was to examine treatment outcomes in a diverse HCV-6 population.We prospectively enrolled 60 HCV-GT6 patients at four US centers. Treatment -naïve without cirrhosis patients received open-labeled LDV/SOF FDC orally once a day for 8 weeks; All cirrhotic and/or treatment-experienced patients received LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained virological response 12 weeks after therapy (SVR12). Secondary outcomes were adverse events (AEs) and/or serious adverse events (SAEs). All patients gave written consent.Overall mean age was 58±10 and 58% were male. All patients were Asian and foreign born. The 8-week group included 20 patients (33.3%) and the 12-week included 40 patients (66.7%). There were 2 (5%) patients with decompensation, 3 with liver cancer (7.5%), and 14 with prior treatment (35%) in the 12-week group. SVR12 was 95.0% for the 8-week group (19/20) and 95.0% for the 12-week group (38/40). AEs included fatigue (5%), insomnia (3.3%), headache (1.7%), and nausea (1.7%); however, all patients completed the intended treatment duration. There were two treatment-unrelated SAEs.LDV/SOF FDC for 8 or 12 weeks was safe and effective for patients without cirrhosis or prior treatment failure as well as for patients with cirrhosis and/or prior treatment failure, respectively.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.399.",

    "articleAbstract": "Temporal changes for intestinal resections for Crohn's disease (CD) are controversial. We validated administrative database codes for CD diagnosis and surgery in hospitalized patients and then evaluated temporal trends in CD surgical resection rates.First, we validated International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10-CM coding for CD diagnosis in hospitalized patients and Canadian Classification of Health Intervention coding for surgical resections. Second, we used these validated codes to conduct population-based surveillance between fiscal years 2002 and 2010 to identify adult CD patients undergoing intestinal resection (n=981). Annual surgical rate was calculated by dividing incident surgeries by estimated CD prevalence. Time trend analysis was performed and annual percent change (APC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in surgical resection rates were calculated using a generalized linear model assuming a Poisson distribution.In the validation cohort, 101/104 (97.1%) patients undergoing surgery and 191/200 (95.5%) patients admitted without surgery were confirmed to have CD on chart review. Among the 116 administrative database codes for surgical resection, 97.4% were confirmed intestinal resections on chart review. From 2002 to 2010, the overall CD surgical resection rate was 3.8 resections per 100 person-years. During the study period, rate of surgery decreased by 3.5% per year (95% CI: -1.1%, -5.8%), driven by decreasing emergent operations (-10.1% per year (95% CI: -13.4%, -6.7%)) whereas elective surgeries increased by 3.7% per year (95% CI: 0.1%, 7.3%).Overall surgical resection rates in CD are decreasing, but a paradigm shift has occurred whereby elective operations are now more commonly performed than emergent surgeries.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.394.",

In a subset of anti-HBc carriers, anti-HBc is present in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody-a serological pattern known as \"isolated anti-HBc\" (IAHBc). IAHBc has been of clinical interest over the past several years, with growing data to suggest its role as a serological marker for occult HBV infection (OBI). This article reviews the clinical significance and association of IAHBc with hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, risk of HBV reactivation during direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV as well as immune suppression, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B core-related antigen is also highlighted as an emerging laboratory assay that may identify OBI and predict HCC development in non-cirrhotic patients receiving nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapy.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.397.",

    "articleAbstract": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of advanced adenomas (AAs), colorectal cancer (CRC), and/or CRC-related death among individuals with low-risk adenomas (LRAs).We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published between January 2006 and July 2015. Quality and strength of the evidence were rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the GRADE framework, respectively.Eleven observational studies (n=64,317) were included. A meta-analysis of eight cohort studies (n=10,139, 3 to 10 years' follow-up) showed a small but statistically significant increase in the incidence of AAs in individuals with LRAs compared with those with a normal baseline colonoscopy (RR 1.55 (95% CI 1.24-1.94); P=0.0001; I(2)=0%). The pooled 5-year cumulative incidence of AA was 3.28% (95% CI: 1.85-5.10%), 4.9% (95% CI: 3.18-6.97%), and 17.13% (95% CI: 11.97-23.0%) for the no adenoma, LRA, and AA baseline groups, respectively. Two studies, which could not be pooled, showed a reduction in the risk of CRC in individuals with LRAs compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.44-0.99) at a median follow-up of 7.7 years and OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.6) at 3-5 years). One large retrospective cohort study found a 25% reduction in CRC mortality in individuals with LRAs compared with the general population (SMR 0.75 (95% CI 0.63-0.88) at a median follow-up of 7.7 years).We observed a small but significant increase in the risk of AAs in people with LRAs compared with those with a normal baseline colonoscopy, but compared with the general population, people with LRAs have significantly lower risks of CRC and of CRC-related mortality.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.360.",

    "articleAbstract": "Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) has been shown to predict outcomes in patients with liver disease. While controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement can accurately quantify hepatic steatosis, its prognostic value is unknown. We aim to determine if CAP is predictive for liver-related events (LRE), non-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cancers, and cardiovascular events (CVE).Consecutive patients with both a reliable LSM and ≥10 successful CAP measurements by TE from August 2012 to March 2016 were included in the analysis. LRE were defined as HCC or hepatic decompensation. CVE were defined as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or coronary intervention (stenting or bypass).Of the 5,848 patients that were examined, 4,282 (56.7% male, median age 57 years) had adequate follow-up, reliable LSM (median 6.1 kPa), and ≥10 CAP measurements (median 250 dB/m). Indications for TE were: suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (40.7%), hepatitis B (HBV) (37.0%), hepatitis C (2.9%), and others (19.4%). During 8,540 patient-years of follow-up, there were 45 patients with LRE (34 HCC, 33 decompensations), 73 with newly diagnosed non-HCC cancers, and 65 with CVE (27 ACS, 25 CVA, and 35 coronary interventions). CAP did not predict LRE, non-HCC cancer, or CVE on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, LSM, male sex, platelet count, serum albumin, and HBV etiology independently predicted LRE; age was the only independent predictor of non-HCC cancer; while age, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and creatinine predicted for CVE. Subgroup analyses of viral hepatitis and NAFLD patients revealed similar results.Neither the presence nor the severity of hepatic steatosis as measured by CAP predict LRE, cancer, or CVE in the short term.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.389.",

However, WAT is a heterogeneous organ containing many cell types that might respond differently to obesity-induced changes. We performed flow cytometry sorting and RNA expression profiling by microarray of major WAT cell types (adipocytes, CD45-/CD31-/CD34+ progenitors, CD45+/CD14+ monocytes/ macrophages, CD45+/CD14- leukocytes), which allowed us to identify genes enriched in specific cell fractions. Additionally, we included adipocytes and adipocyte progenitor cells obtained from lean and obese individuals. Taken together, we provide a detailed gene expression atlas of major human adipose tissue resident cell types for clinical/basic research and using this dataset provide lists of cell-type specific genes that are of interest for metabolic research.",

    "articleAbstract": "Dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR) has been a key process influencing the global carbon cycle, atmospheric composition and climate for much of Earth's history, yet the energy metabolism of sulfate-reducing microbes remains poorly understood. Many organisms, particularly sulfate reducers, live in low-energy environments and metabolize at very low rates, requiring specific physiological adaptations. We identify one such potential adaptation-the electron carriers selected for survival under energy-limited conditions. Employing a quantitative biochemical-isotopic model, we find that the large S isotope fractionations (>55‰) observed in a wide range of natural environments and culture experiments at low respiration rates are only possible when the standard-state Gibbs free energy (ΔG'°) of all steps during DSR is more positive than -10 kJ mol(-1). This implies that at low respiration rates, only electron carriers with modestly negative reduction potentials are involved, such as menaquinone, rubredoxin, rubrerythrin or some flavodoxins. Furthermore, the constraints from S isotope fractionation imply that ferredoxins with a strongly negative reduction potential cannot be the direct electron donor to S intermediates at low respiration rates. Although most sulfate reducers have the genetic potential to express a variety of electron carriers, our results suggest that a key physiological adaptation of sulfate reducers to low-energy environments is to use electron carriers with modestly negative reduction potentials.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.185.",

    "articleAbstract": "Retreating glaciers and ice sheets are among the clearest signs of global climate change. One consequence of glacier retreat is the formation of new meltwater-lakes in previously ice-covered terrain. These lakes provide unique opportunities to understand patterns in community organization during early lake ontogeny. Here, we analyzed the bacterial community structure and diversity in six lakes recently formed by the retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). The lakes represented a turbidity gradient depending on their past and present connectivity to the GrIS meltwaters. Bulk (16S rRNA genes) and putatively active (16S rRNA) fractions of the bacterioplankton communities were structured by changes in environmental conditions associated to the turbidity gradient. Differences in community structure among lakes were attributed to both, rare and abundant community members. Further, positive co-occurrence relationships among phylogenetically closely related community members dominate in these lakes. Our results show that environmental conditions along the turbidity gradient structure bacterial community composition, which shifts during lake ontogeny. Rare taxa contribute to these shifts, suggesting that the rare biosphere has an important ecological role during early lakes ontogeny. Members of the rare biosphere may be adapted to the transient niches in these nutrient poor lakes. The directionality and phylogenetic structure of co-occurrence relationships indicate that competitive interactions among closely related taxa may be important in the most turbid lakes.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.191.",

    "articleAbstract": "Prochlorococcus is a globally important marine cyanobacterium that lacks the gene catalase and relies on 'helper' bacteria such as Alteromonas to remove reactive oxygen species. Increasing atmospheric CO2 decreases the need for carbon concentrating mechanisms and photorespiration in phytoplankton, potentially altering their metabolism and microbial interactions even when carbon is not limiting growth. Here, Prochlorococcus (VOL4, MIT9312) was co-cultured with Alteromonas (strain EZ55) under ambient (400 p.p.m.) and elevated CO2 (800 p.p.m.). Under elevated CO2, Prochlorococcus had a significantly longer lag phase and greater apparent die-offs after transfers suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. Whole-transcriptome analysis of Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the carbon fixation operon, including carboxysome subunits, corresponding with significantly fewer carboxysome structures observed by electron microscopy. Prochlorococcus co-culture responsive gene 1 had significantly increased expression in elevated CO2, potentially indicating a shift in the microbial interaction. Transcriptome analysis of Alteromonas in co-culture with Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the catalase gene, known to be critical in relieving oxidative stress in Prochlorococcus by removing hydrogen peroxide. The decrease in catalase gene expression was corroborated by a significant ~6-fold decrease in removal rates of hydrogen peroxide from co-cultures. These data suggest Prochlorococcus may be more vulnerable to oxidative stress under elevated CO2 in part from a decrease in ecosystem services provided by heterotrophs like Alteromonas. This work highlights the importance of considering microbial interactions in the context of a changing ocean.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.189.",

    "articleAbstract": "Prochlorococcus, the smallest and most abundant phytoplankter in the ocean, is highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (HOOH), and co-occurring heterotrophs such as Alteromonas facilitate the growth of Prochlorococcus by scavenging HOOH. Temperature is also a major influence on Prochlorococcus abundance and distribution in the ocean, and studies in other photosynthetic organisms have shown that HOOH and temperature extremes can act together as synergistic stressors. To address potential synergistic effects of temperature and HOOH on Prochlorococcus growth, high- and low-temperature-adapted representative strains were cultured at ecologically relevant concentrations under a range of HOOH concentrations and temperatures. Higher concentrations of HOOH severely diminished the permissive temperature range for growth of both Prochlorococcus strains. At the permissive temperatures, the growth rates of both Prochlorococcus strains decreased as a function of HOOH, and cold temperature increased susceptibility of photosystem II to HOOH-mediated damage. Serving as a proxy for the natural community, co-cultured heterotrophic bacteria increased the Prochlorococcus growth rate under these temperatures, and expanded the permissive range of temperature for growth. These studies indicate that in the ocean, the cross-protective function of the microbial community may confer a fitness increase for Prochlorococcus at its temperature extremes, especially near the ocean surface where oxidative stress is highest. This interaction may play a substantial role in defining the realized thermal niche and habitat range of Prochlorococcus with respect to latitude.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.182.",

    "articleAbstract": "Wood-inhabiting fungi have essential roles in the regulation of carbon stocks and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. However, knowledge pertaining to wood-inhabiting fungi is only fragmentary and controversial. Here we established a large-scale deadwood experiment with 11 tree species to investigate diversity and tree species preferences of wood-inhabiting fungi using next-generation sequencing. Our results contradict existing knowledge based on sporocarp surveys and challenge current views on their distribution and diversity in temperate forests. Analyzing α-, β- and γ-diversity, we show that diverse fungi colonize deadwood at different spatial scales. Specifically, coniferous species have higher α- and γ-diversity than the majority of analyzed broadleaf species, but two broadleaf species showed the highest β-diversity. Surprisingly, we found nonrandom co-occurrence (P<0.001) and strong tree species preferences of wood-inhabiting fungi, especially in broadleaf trees (P<0.01). Our results indicate that the saprotrophic fungal community is more specific to tree species than previously thought.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.177.",

    "articleAbstract": "The tropical ascidian Lissoclinum patella hosts two enigmatic cyanobacteria: (1) the photoendosymbiont Prochloron spp., a producer of valuable bioactive compounds and (2) the chlorophyll-d containing Acaryochloris spp., residing in the near-infrared enriched underside of the animal. Despite numerous efforts, Prochloron remains uncultivable, restricting the investigation of its biochemical potential to cultivation-independent techniques. Likewise, in both cyanobacteria, universally important parameters on light-niche adaptation and in situ photosynthetic regulation are unknown. Here we used genome sequencing, transcriptomics and metabolomics to investigate the symbiotic linkage between host and photoendosymbiont and simultaneously probed the transcriptional response of Acaryochloris in situ. During high light, both cyanobacteria downregulate CO2 fixing pathways, likely a result of O2 photorespiration on the functioning of RuBisCO, and employ a variety of stress-quenching mechanisms, even under less stressful far-red light (Acaryochloris). Metabolomics reveals a distinct biochemical modulation between Prochloron and L. patella, including noon/midnight-dependent signatures of amino acids, nitrogenous waste products and primary photosynthates. Surprisingly, Prochloron constitutively expressed genes coding for patellamides, that is, cyclic peptides of great pharmaceutical value, with yet unknown ecological significance. Together these findings shed further light on far-red-driven photosynthesis in natural consortia, the interplay of Prochloron and its ascidian partner in a model chordate photosymbiosis and the uncultivability of Prochloron.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 31 October 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.192.",

But compared to human, where several previously unknown RNAs have been uncovered, the macaque transcriptome is less studied. Publicly available RNA expression resources for macaque are limited, even for brain, which is highly relevant to study human cognitive abilities. In an effort to complement those resources, FANTOM5 profiled 15 distinct anatomical regions of the aged macaque central nervous system using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression, a high-resolution, annotation-independent technology that allows monitoring of transcription initiation events with high accuracy. We identified 25,869 CAGE peaks, representing bona fide promoters. For each peak we provide detailed annotation, expanding the landscape of 'known' macaque genes, and we show concrete examples on how to use the resulting data. We believe this data represents a useful resource to understand the central nervous system in macaque.",

    "articleAbstract": "We previously found that electrical stimulation in the anterior limb of the internal capsule/bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (IC/BST) alleviates depressive symptoms in severe treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Here we tested the hypothesis that electrical stimulation in either IC/BST or in the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP) effectively reduces depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). In a double-blind crossover design, the effects of electrical stimulation at both targets were compared in TRD patients. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) was the primary outcome measure. During the first crossover, patients received IC/BST stimulation versus no stimulation in random order (2 × 1 weeks). During the second crossover (3 × 2 months), patients received IC/BST versus ITP versus no stimulation. Patients and evaluators were blinded for stimulation conditions. All patients (n=7) were followed up for at least 3 years (3-8 years) after implantation. Six patients completed the first crossover and five patients completed the second. During the first crossover, mean (s.d.) HAM-D scores were 21.5 (2.7) for no stimulation and 11.5 (8.8) for IC/BST stimulation. During the second crossover, HAM-D scores were 15.4 (7.5) for no stimulation, 7.6 (3.8) for IC/BST stimulation and 11.2 (7.5) for ITP stimulation. The final sample size was too small to statistically analyze this second crossover. At last follow-up, only one patient preferred ITP over IC/BST stimulation. Two patients, with a history of suicide attempts before implantation, committed suicide during the follow-up phases of this study. Our data indicate that, in the long term, both ITP and IC/BST stimulation may alleviate depressive symptoms in patients suffering from TRD.",

    "articleAbstract": "Unsurprisingly, the subject of dementia has been a rising matter of public health concerns as people now live longer. World Alzheimer Report 2015, estimate that about 46.8 million people worldwide have dementia. These numbers are projected to almost double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. The modality for treating agitation and other behavioral symptoms in dementia patients has been a challenge. Many years on, there has been no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy in treating dementia-related agitation. This review discusses the current knowledge of non-pharmacological interventions, and analyzes the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy in the management of dementia-related agitation, as well as providing an anecdotal of the author's clinical experience. This article aims to provide opportunity for increase awareness for clinicians, particularly those with no specialty training in geriatrics medicine but see dementia patients with agitation and other behavioral symptoms from time to time. Likewise, it hopefully will benefit the readers of medical journals to update their existing knowledge on matters relating to the management of dementia-related agitation.",

As oxygen levels decline, nutrients and energy are increasingly diverted away from higher trophic levels into microbial community metabolism, resulting in fixed nitrogen loss and production of climate active trace gases including nitrous oxide and methane. While ocean deoxygenation has been reported on a global scale, our understanding of OMZ biology and geochemistry is limited by a lack of time-resolved data sets. Here, we present a historical dataset of oxygen concentrations spanning fifty years and nine years of monthly geochemical time series observations in Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada that undergoes recurring changes in water column oxygenation status. This compendium provides a unique geochemical framework for evaluating long-term trends in biogeochemical cycling in OMZ waters.",

    "articleAbstract": "Polypharmacy is increasingly common in the United States, and contributes to the substantial burden of drug-related morbidity. Yet real-world polypharmacy patterns remain poorly characterized. We have counted the incidence of multi-drug combinations observed in four billion patient-months of outpatient prescription drug claims from 2007-2014 in the Truven Health MarketScan® Databases. Prescriptions are grouped into discrete windows of concomitant drug exposure, which are used to count exposure incidences for combinations of up to five drug ingredients or ATC drug classes. Among patients taking any prescription drug, half are exposed to two or more drugs, and 5% are exposed to 8 or more. The most common multi-drug combinations treat manifestations of metabolic syndrome. Patients are exposed to unique drug combinations in 10% of all exposure windows. Our analysis of multi-drug exposure incidences provides a detailed summary of polypharmacy in a large US cohort, which can prioritize common drug combinations for future safety and efficacy studies.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nitrogen doping in graphene is important for applications spanning from electronics to metal-free electrocatalysts. Despite much experimental study, limited theoretic work has been done in understanding the mechanism of the doping process, especially from a precision perspective. Herein, we present a computational study on precision nitrogen doping on edges of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) by combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a time scale of 40 nanoseconds and density function theory (DFT) calculation. In the MD study both ammonia and acetonitrile were used as nitrogen sources. MD results revealed that the ammonia produces almost all amine-type dopants, while the acetonitrile produces a considerable amount of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen dopants which are beneficial to electronics and electrocatalysts. Results also show that the concentration of pyrrolic and pyridinic dopants can be precisely controlled by the edge geometries of the GNRs. Furthermore, DFT calculation illustrated the reaction mechanism in these different types of the GNRs when using acetonitrile as the nitrogen source. The calculated energies in different reaction stages indicate the stability of dopants on various GNRs, agreeing well with the MD results. The disclosed mechanism of controllable nitrogen doping on the edges of the GNRs would provide guidance to experimental realization, paving new routes to widespread applications.",

The compound does not show any long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. The material exhibits large magnetic entropy change (-ΔS&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 13.7 J/kg K) and adiabatic temperature change (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 4.4 K) at 2.2 K for a field change of 20 kOe which can be realized by permanent magnets, thus being very beneficial for application purpose. In the absence of long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, metastable nature of the low temperature spin dynamics and short range magnetic correlations are considered to be responsible for such large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) over a wide temperature region.",

In this paper, we have reported electron beam-induced reversible elastic-to-plastic transition in Ag/Al2O3 and Au/Al2O3 NWs prepared by coating of Ag and Au NWs with Al2O3 by low temperature atomic layer deposition. The observed phenomenon enabled freezing the bent core-shell NW at any arbitral curvature below the yield strength of the materials and later restoring its initially straight profile by irradiating the NW with electrons. In addition, we demonstrated that the coating efficiently protects core material from fracture and plastic yield, allowing it to withstand significantly higher deformations and stresses in comparison to uncoated NW.",

    "articleAbstract": "Melanin plays a crucial role as a pigment all through the animal kingdom. Being a macromolecule just on the divide between an ordered crystalline or a purely amorphous form melanin has proven a challenge to structure-function analysis. Melanin assembles from small molecules much like a jigsaw and much like in a jigsaw the fine detail quickly vanishes in the overall picture. With Melanin being first and foremost a photo-active molecule we focus on spectral properties for the characterization of its structure. We use absorption measurements to illustrate the complex nature of the formation process. To gain a better hold on the formation pathway we use coupled measurements of excitation and emission to identify 'areas of interest' in the Excitation-Emission Matrix (EEM). We then probe one area for characteristic fluorescence lifetimes to track one melanin building block through the formation process. Comparison of the EEMs of L-Dopa derived melanin with natural Sepia melanin shows characteristic differences. We show how the presence of copper ions creates a melanin closer to its natural form.",

Crystal structure analysis reveals that complete solid solution exists only up to &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.1, and above which chemical phase separation of two/three phases occur and persists up to &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.7 composition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement also corroborates the existence of Cr&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; for the intermediate composition &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.4, which by virtue reinforces the astonishing scheelite-type GdCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation (at ambient pressure) for 0.2 ≤ &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.5 compositions. Electrical resistivity measurements affirm the temperature driven metal to insulator (M-I) transition for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05 and 0.1 samples. Low temperature insulating state in these samples are interpreted by electron electron interaction of weak disordered systems. Precise analysis of temperature dependent resistivity for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.2 samples (which have insulating ground state) dictate that transport phenomenon is mainly associated with the Arrhenius-type charge conduction, Mott's variable range hopping, short-range and long-range Coulomb interaction mediated hopping processes due to high degree of randomness. Interruption of magnetic Ru-O-Ru interaction by Ru-O-Cr and Cr-O-Cr interactions lowers the FM transition temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) and therefore introduces Griffiths phase in phase separated samples. Furthermore, we believe that a sharp rise in magnetization at low temperature for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.2 samples is due to the formation of AFM GdCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; phase. Prominent thermal hysteresis in temperature dependent magnetization curves for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.8 and appearance of spin-reorientation transition for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 1 are the distinct indications for transformation into canted AFM GdCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oxide at higher &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;. The effective magnetic moment (μ&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;) continuously increases with the incorporation of higher moment elements (Gd and Cr); while, coercive field(H&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits abrupt variation as a function of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; at the onset of phase separation.",

This work indicates that highly uniform Cu2-xS (where 0 ≦ x ≧ 1) nanosheets can be obtained by the two-step method of Cu deposition by sputtering with precisely controlled and extremely low growth rate followed by vapor-phase sulfurization. The phase transformations of thin Cu2-xS films upon the Cu seed layer thickness are investigated. A unique thickness-constrained synthesis process using vapor-phase sulfurization is employed here, which evolves from a vertical to lateral growth mechanism based on the optimization of the Cu seed layer thickness. Atomically thin 2D β-Cu2S film was successfully synthesized using the thinnest Cu seed film. We have systematically investigated the phase- and thickness-dependent optical properties of Cu2-xS films at room temperature (RT). Micro-photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals that the 2D β-Cu2S film possesses a direct band gap with an energy of 1.1 eV while the PL intensities are greatly suppressed in the multilayer Cu2-xS (where 0 ≦ x ≦ 1).",

    "articleAbstract": "Understanding the electronic structure of metal oxide semiconductors is crucial to their numerous technological applications, such as photoelectrochemical water splitting and solar cells. The needed experimental and theoretical knowledge goes beyond that of pristine bulk crystals, and must include the effects of surfaces and interfaces, as well as those due to the presence of intrinsic defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies), or dopants for band engineering. In this review, we present an account of the recent efforts in predicting and understanding the optoelectronic properties of oxides using ab initio theoretical methods. In particular, we discuss the performance of recently developed dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, providing a comparison against the results of many-body GW calculations, including G0W0 as well as more refined approaches, such as quasiparticle self-consistent GW. We summarize results in the recent literature for the band gap, the band level alignment at surfaces, and optical transition energies in defective oxides, including wide gap oxide semiconductors and transition metal oxides. Correlated transition metal oxides are also discussed. For each method, we describe successes and drawbacks, emphasizing the challenges faced by the development of improved theoretical approaches. The theoretical section is preceded by a critical overview of the main experimental techniques needed to characterize the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors, including absorption and reflection spectroscopy, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).",

While sub-10 nm diameter nanowire arrays have been difficult to fabricate, we present here a novel template for sub-10 nm thermoelectric nanowire array fabrication using anodized aluminum oxide followed by silica wall coating for pore confinement. Electrodeposited bismuth telluride nanowires displayed increasing electrical-to-thermal conductivity ratio as the pore diameter decreased, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Achieving the desired stoichiometric ratio of Bi2Te3 through electrodeposition was non-trivial, which limited the Seebeck coefficient of the nanowires. However, hydrolysis of the nanopore walls led to improved electrodeposition achieving near stoichiometric bismuth-to-tellurium ratios and ultimately p-type thermoelectric nanowire arrays with a Seebeck coefficient of 79 μV/K.",

    "articleAbstract": "In this paper, an approach is proposed to achieve simultaneous imaging and broadband nanomechanical mapping of soft materials in air by using atomic force microscope (AFM). Simultaneous imaging and nanomechanical mapping is needed, for example, to correlate morphological and mechanical evolutions of the sample during dynamic phenomena such as cell defusion process. Current techniques for nanomechanical mapping, however, are only capable of capturing static elasticity of the material, or the material viscoelasticity in a narrow frequency band around the resonant frequency(ies) of the cantilever used, not competent for broadband nanomechanical mapping, nor acquiring topography image of the sample simultaneously. These limitations are addressed in this work by enabling the augmentation of an excitation force stimuli of rich frequency spectrum for nanomechanical mapping in the imaging process. Kalman-filtering technique is exploited to decouple and split the mixed signals for imaging and mapping, respectively. Then the sample indentation generated is quantified online via a system-inversion method, and the effects of the indentation generated and the topography tracking error are taken into account in the topography quantification. Moreover, a data-driven feedforward-feedback control is utilized to track the sample topography. The proposed approach is illustrated through experimental implementation on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sample with a pre-fabricated pattern.",

    "articleAbstract": "PhotoElectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is a novel spectroscopy that presents surprising sensitivity to conformational effects in chiral systems. While classical PhotoElectron Spectroscopy responds to conformational effects mainly in terms of energy level shifts, PECD provides a rich and detailed response to tiny changes of the electronic and structural properties by means of the dispersion of the intensity of the circular dichroism as a function of photoelectron kinetic energy. In this work PECD basics will be outlined emphasizing the role of the interference of the l,l±1 outgoing partial wave of the photoelectron in the PECD transition matrix element, that is responsible of the extreme sensitivity to conformational effects. Examples on molecular systems and interfaces will shade light on the powerful application of PECD to classical conformational effects such as group substitution, isomerism, conformer population, clustering. Moreover PECD results in new challenging fields where conformations play a key role, such as vibrational effects, transient chirality, time resolved experiments, will be reported. To date PECD is mostly based on synchrotron radiation facilities, but it has a future as a lab table-top experiment by means of multi-photon ionisation. An important application of PECD as an analytical tool will be reported. The aim of the review is to illustrate that in PECD the conformational effects are essential to understand a wide range of effects from a new perspective, different from classical spectroscopy.",

    "articleAbstract": "The conversion of immature noninfectious HIV-1 particles to infectious virions is dependent upon the sequential cleavage of the precursor group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein by HIV-1 protease. The precise mechanism whereby protease recognizes distinct Gag cleavage sites, located in the intrinsically disordered linkers connecting the globular domains of Gag, remains unclear. Here, we probe the dynamics of the interaction of large fragments of Gag and various variants of protease (including a drug resistant construct) using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation dispersion and chemical exchange saturation transfer NMR experiments. We show that the conformational dynamics within the flaps of HIV-1 protease that form the lid over the catalytic cleft play a significant role in substrate specificity and ordered Gag processing. Rapid interconversion between closed and open protease flap conformations facilitates the formation of a transient, sparsely populated productive complex between protease and Gag substrates. Flap closure traps the Gag cleavage sites within the catalytic cleft of protease. Modulation of flap opening through protease-Gag interactions fine-tunes the lifetime of the productive complex and hence the likelihood of Gag proteolysis. A productive complex can also be formed in the presence of a noncognate substrate but is short-lived owing to lack of optimal complementarity between the active site cleft of protease and the substrate, resulting in rapid flap opening and substrate release, thereby allowing protease to differentiate between cognate and noncognate substrates.",

    "articleAbstract": "Expression of the transcription factor FOXC2 is induced and necessary for successful epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a developmental program that when activated in cancer endows cells with metastatic potential and the properties of stem cells. As such, identifying agents that inhibit the growth of FOXC2-transformed cells represents an attractive approach to inhibit chemotherapy resistance and metastatic dissemination. From a high throughput synthetic lethal screen, we identified a small molecule, FiVe1, which selectively and irreversibly inhibits the growth of mesenchymally transformed breast cancer cells and soft tissue sarcomas of diverse histological subtypes. FiVe1 targets the intermediate filament and mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) in a mode which promotes VIM disorganization and phosphorylation during metaphase, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe, multinucleation, and the loss of stemness. These findings illustrate a previously undescribed mechanism for interrupting faithful mitotic progression and may ultimately inform the design of therapies for a broad range of mesenchymal cancers.",

    "articleAbstract": "NIH 3T3 cells grown in conventional Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's basal medium (DME) produce no transformed foci when grown to confluence in 10% calf serum (CS). A few cultures were transformed by ras oncogenes when transfected with DNA from neoplastic cells, but they failed to do so in 80 to 90% of the transfections. However, when they were grown in a medium [molecular, cellular, and developmental biology 402 (MCDB 402)] optimized for their clonal growth in minimal serum, they produced transformed foci without transfection in 10% CS, but not in 2% CS. The first response to growth in MCDB 402 in 2% CS in successive rounds of contact inhibition was uniform increases in saturation density of the population. This was followed by the appearance of transformed foci. A systematic study was made of the dynamics of neoplastic progression in various concentrations of CS in a single round of confluence at 2 and 3 wk, followed by three sequential rounds of confluence in 2% CS for 2 wk. There was a linear relationship between CS concentration and saturation density in the first-round cultures and continuing differences in subsequent cultures. The hyperplastic field of normal-looking cells surrounding transformed foci became increasingly permissive for transformation with serial culture. The dynamics show that epigenetic selection is the major driving force of neoplastic development. Cells from dense foci produced malignant fibrosarcomas in mice, thereby exhibiting a positive relationship between transformation in culture and the development of tumors.",

    "articleAbstract": "The transmission of viral infections between plant and fungal hosts has been suspected to occur, based on phylogenetic and other findings, but has not been directly observed in nature. Here, we report the discovery of a natural infection of the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani by a plant virus, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). The CMV-infected R. solani strain was obtained from a potato plant growing in Inner Mongolia Province of China, and CMV infection was stable when this fungal strain was cultured in the laboratory. CMV was horizontally transmitted through hyphal anastomosis but not vertically through basidiospores. By inoculation via protoplast transfection with virions, a reference isolate of CMV replicated in R. solani and another phytopathogenic fungus, suggesting that some fungi can serve as alternative hosts to CMV. Importantly, in fungal inoculation experiments under laboratory conditions, R. solani could acquire CMV from an infected plant, as well as transmit the virus to an uninfected plant. This study presents evidence of the transfer of a virus between plant and fungus, and it further expands our understanding of plant-fungus interactions and the spread of plant viruses.",

    "articleAbstract": "The 14-3-3 proteins, a family of highly conserved scaffolding proteins ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells, interact with and regulate the function of several hundreds of partner proteins. Yeast neutral trehalases (Nth), enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of trehalose to glucose, compared with trehalases from other organisms, possess distinct structure and regulation involving phosphorylation at multiple sites followed by binding to the 14-3-3 protein. Here we report the crystal structures of yeast Nth1 and its complex with Bmh1 (yeast 14-3-3 isoform), which, together with mutational and fluorescence studies, indicate that the binding of Nth1 by 14-3-3 triggers Nth1's activity by enabling the proper 3D configuration of Nth1's catalytic and calcium-binding domains relative to each other, thus stabilizing the flexible part of the active site required for catalysis. The presented structure of the Bmh1:Nth1 complex highlights the ability of 14-3-3 to modulate the structure of a multidomain binding partner and to function as an allosteric effector. Furthermore, comparison of the Bmh1:Nth1 complex structure with those of 14-3-3:serotonin N-acetyltransferase and 14-3-3:heat shock protein beta-6 complexes revealed similarities in the 3D structures of bound partner proteins, suggesting the highly conserved nature of 14-3-3 affects the structures of many client proteins.",

A diversity panel of wild species, landraces, and cultivars was sequenced to assess genetic variation within tuber-bearing Solanum and the impact of domestication on genome diversity and identify key loci selected for cultivation in North and South America. Sequence diversity of diploid and tetraploid Stuberosum exceeded any crop resequencing study to date, in part due to expanded wild introgressions following polyploidy that captured alleles outside of their geographic origin. We identified 2,622 genes as under selection, with only 14-16% shared by North American and Andean cultivars, showing that a limited gene set drove early improvement of cultivated potato, while adaptation of upland (Stuberosum group Andigena) and lowland (S. tuberosum groups Chilotanum and Tuberosum) populations targeted distinct loci. Signatures of selection were uncovered in genes controlling carbohydrate metabolism, glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, the cell cycle, and circadian rhythm. Reduced sexual fertility that accompanied the shift to asexual reproduction in cultivars was reflected by signatures of selection in genes regulating pollen development/gametogenesis. Exploration of haplotype diversity at potato's maturity locus (StCDF1) revealed introgression of truncated alleles from wild species, particularly Smicrodontum in long-day-adapted cultivars. This study uncovers a historic role of wild Solanum species in the diversification of long-day-adapted tetraploid potatoes, showing that extant natural populations represent an essential source of untapped adaptive potential.",

    "articleAbstract": "In the human sodium glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1) cycle, the protein undergoes conformational changes where the sugar-binding site alternatively faces the external and internal surfaces. Functional site-directed fluorometry was used to probe the conformational changes at the sugar-binding site. Residues (Y290, T287, H83, and N78) were mutated to cysteines. The mutants were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and tagged with environmentally sensitive fluorescent rhodamines [e.g., tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-thiols]. The fluorescence intensity was recorded as the mutants were driven into different conformations using voltage jumps. Sugar binding and transport by the fluorophore-tagged mutants were blocked, but Na(+) binding and the voltage-dependent conformational transitions were unaffected. Structural models indicated that external Na(+) binding opened a large aqueous vestibule (600 Å(3)) leading to the sugar-binding site. The fluorescence of TMR covalently linked to Y290C, T287C, and H83C decreased as the mutant proteins were driven from the inward to the outward open Na(+)-bound conformation. The time courses of fluorescence changes (milliseconds) were close to the SGLT1 capacitive charge movements. The quench in rhodamine fluorescence indicated that the environment of the chromophores became more polar with opening of the external gates as the protein transitioned from the inward to outward facing state. Structural analyses showed an increase in polar side chains and a decrease in hydrophobic side chains lining the vestibule, and this was reflected in solvation of the chromophore. The results demonstrate the opening and closing of external gates in real time, with the accompanying changes of polarity of the sugar vestibule.",

    "articleAbstract": "Ubiquitin E3 ligases are crucial for eliminating misfolded proteins before they form cytotoxic aggregates that threaten cell fitness and survival. However, it remains unclear how emerging misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm can be selectively recognized and eliminated by E3 ligases in plants. We found that Misfolded Protein Sensing RING E3 ligase 1 (MPSR1) is an indispensable E3 ligase required for plant survival after protein-damaging stress. Under no stress, MPSR1 is prone to rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome, concealing its protein quality control (PQC) E3 ligase activity. Upon proteotoxic stress, MPSR1 directly senses incipient misfolded proteins and tethers ubiquitins for subsequent degradation. Furthermore, MPSR1 sustains the structural integrity of the proteasome complex at the initial stage of proteotoxic stress. Here, we suggest that the MPSR1 pathway is a constitutive mechanism for proteostasis under protein-damaging stress, as a front-line surveillance system in the cytoplasm.",

    "articleAbstract": "There is still a large gap in our understanding between the functional complexity of cells and the reconstruction of partial cellular functions in vitro from purified or engineered parts. Here we have introduced artificial vesicles of defined composition into living cells to probe the capacity of the cellular cytoplasm in dealing with foreign material and to develop tools for the directed manipulation of cellular functions. Our data show that protein-free liposomes, after variable delay times, are captured by the Golgi apparatus that is reached either by random diffusion or, in the case of large unilamellar vesicles, by microtubule-dependent transport via a dynactin/dynein motor complex. However, insertion of early endosomal SNARE proteins suffices to convert liposomes into trafficking vesicles that dock and fuse with early endosomes, thus overriding the default pathway to the Golgi. Moreover, such liposomes can be directed to mitochondria expressing simple artificial affinity tags, which can also be employed to divert endogenous trafficking vesicles. In addition, fusion or subsequent acidification of liposomes can be monitored by incorporation of appropriate chemical sensors. This approach provides an opportunity for probing and manipulating cellular functions that cannot be addressed by conventional genetic approaches. We conclude that the cellular cytoplasm has a remarkable capacity for self-organization and that introduction of such macromolecular complexes may advance nanoengineering of eukaryotic cells.",

    "articleAbstract": "Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) mediate numerous neural patterning functions, including neuronal self-recognition and non-self-discrimination to direct self-avoidance among vertebrate neurons. Individual neurons stochastically express a subset of Pcdh isoforms, which assemble to form a stochastic repertoire of cis-dimers. We describe the structure of a PcdhγB7 cis-homodimer, which includes the membrane-proximal extracellular cadherin domains EC5 and EC6. The structure is asymmetric with one molecule contributing interface surface from both EC5 and EC6, and the other only from EC6. Structural and sequence analyses suggest that all Pcdh isoforms will dimerize through this interface. Site-directed mutants at this interface interfere with both Pcdh cis-dimerization and cell surface transport. The structure explains the known restrictions of cis-interactions of some Pcdh isoforms, including α-Pcdhs, which cannot form homodimers. The asymmetry of the interface approximately doubles the size of the recognition repertoire, and restrictions on cis-interactions among Pcdh isoforms define the limits of the Pcdh recognition unit repertoire.",

    "articleAbstract": "Neuroscientists have long debated whether some regions of the human brain are exclusively engaged in a single specific mental process. Consistent with this view, fMRI has revealed cortical regions that respond selectively to certain stimulus classes such as faces. However, results from multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) challenge this view by demonstrating that category-selective regions often contain information about \"nonpreferred\" stimulus dimensions. But is this nonpreferred information causally relevant to behavior? Here we report a rare opportunity to test this question in a neurosurgical patient implanted for clinical reasons with strips of electrodes along his fusiform gyri. Broadband gamma electrocorticographic responses in multiple adjacent electrodes showed strong selectivity for faces in a region corresponding to the fusiform face area (FFA), and preferential responses to color in a nearby site, replicating earlier reports. To test the causal role of these regions in the perception of nonpreferred dimensions, we then electrically stimulated individual sites while the patient viewed various objects. When stimulated in the FFA, the patient reported seeing an illusory face (or \"facephene\"), independent of the object viewed. Similarly, stimulation of color-preferring sites produced illusory \"rainbows.\" Crucially, the patient reported no change in the object viewed, apart from the facephenes and rainbows apparently superimposed on them. The functional and anatomical specificity of these effects indicate that some cortical regions are exclusively causally engaged in a single specific mental process, and prompt caution about the widespread assumption that any information scientists can decode from the brain is causally relevant to behavior.",

    "articleAbstract": "Many countries are utilizing reclaimed wastewater for agriculture because drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations are increasing water demands. Unfortunately, wastewater often contains biologically active, pseudopersistent pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Runoff from farms and output from wastewater treatment plants also contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on an agricultural pest, Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Larvae were reared on artificial diets spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Trichoplusia ni showed increased developmental time and mortality when reared on artificial diets containing antibiotics, hormones, or a mixture of contaminants. Mortality was also increased when T. ni were reared on tomatoes grown hydroponically with the same concentrations of antibiotics. The antibiotic-treated plants translocated ciprofloxacin through their tissues to roots, shoots, and leaves. Microbial communities of T. ni changed substantially between developmental stages and when exposed to CECs in their diets. Our results suggest that use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation of crops can affect the developmental biology and microbial communities of an insect of agricultural importance.",

    "articleAbstract": "Meiotic recombination is the most important source of genetic variation in higher eukaryotes. It is initiated by formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomal DNA in early meiotic prophase. The DSBs are subsequently repaired, resulting in crossovers (COs) and noncrossovers (NCOs). Recombination events are not distributed evenly along chromosomes but cluster at recombination hotspots. How specific sites become hotspots is poorly understood. Studies in yeast and mammals linked initiation of meiotic recombination to active chromatin features present upstream from genes, such as absence of nucleosomes and presence of trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3). Core recombination components are conserved among eukaryotes, but it is unclear whether this conservation results in universal characteristics of recombination landscapes shared by a wide range of species. To address this question, we mapped meiotic DSBs in maize, a higher eukaryote with a large genome that is rich in repetitive DNA. We found DSBs in maize to be frequent in all chromosome regions, including sites lacking COs, such as centromeres and pericentromeric regions. Furthermore, most DSBs are formed in repetitive DNA, predominantly Gypsy retrotransposons, and only one-quarter of DSB hotspots are near genes. Genic and nongenic hotspots differ in several characteristics, and only genic DSBs contribute to crossover formation. Maize hotspots overlap regions of low nucleosome occupancy but show only limited association with H3K4me3 sites. Overall, maize DSB hotspots exhibit distribution patterns and characteristics not reported previously in other species. Understanding recombination patterns in maize will shed light on mechanisms affecting dynamics of the plant genome.",

    "articleAbstract": "We extend an established simulation-based method to test for significant short-duration (1-2 centuries) demographic events known from one documented historical and one oral historical context. Case study 1 extrapolates population data from the Western historical tradition using historically derived demographic data from the catastrophic European Black Death/bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis). We find a corresponding statistically significant drop in absolute population using an extended version of a previously published simulation method. Case study 2 uses this refined simulation method to test for a settlement gap identified in oral historical records of descendant Tsimshian First Nations communities from the Prince Rupert Harbour region of the Pacific Northwest region of British Columbia, Canada. Using a regional database of n = 523 radiocarbon dates, we find a significant drop in relative population using the extended simulation-based method consistent with Tsimshian oral records. We conclude that our technical refinement extends the utility of radiocarbon simulation methods and can provide a rigorous test of demographic predictions derived from a range of historical sources.",

    "articleAbstract": "Escherichia coli UvrD DNA helicase functions in several DNA repair processes. As a monomer, UvrD can translocate rapidly and processively along ssDNA; however, the monomer is a poor helicase. To unwind duplex DNA in vitro, UvrD needs to be activated either by self-assembly to form a dimer or by interaction with an accessory protein. However, the mechanism of activation is not understood. UvrD can exist in multiple conformations associated with the rotational conformational state of its 2B subdomain, and its helicase activity has been correlated with a closed 2B conformation. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we examined the rotational conformational states of the 2B subdomain of fluorescently labeled UvrD and their rates of interconversion. We find that the 2B subdomain of the UvrD monomer can rotate between an open and closed conformation as well as two highly populated intermediate states. The binding of a DNA substrate shifts the 2B conformation of a labeled UvrD monomer to a more open state that shows no helicase activity. The binding of a second unlabeled UvrD shifts the 2B conformation of the labeled UvrD to a more closed state resulting in activation of helicase activity. Binding of a monomer of the structurally similar Escherichia coli Rep helicase does not elicit this effect. This indicates that the helicase activity of a UvrD dimer is promoted via direct interactions between UvrD subunits that affect the rotational conformational state of its 2B subdomain.",

    "articleAbstract": "Nucleotidyl cyclases, including membrane-integral and soluble adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, are central components in a wide range of signaling pathways. These proteins are architecturally diverse, yet many of them share a conserved feature, a helical region that precedes the catalytic cyclase domain. The role of this region in cyclase dimerization has been a subject of debate. Although mutations within this region in various cyclases have been linked to genetic diseases, the molecular details of their effects on the enzymes remain unknown. Here, we report an X-ray structure of the cytosolic portion of the membrane-integral adenylyl cyclase Cya from Mycobacterium intracellulare in a nucleotide-bound state. The helical domains of each Cya monomer form a tight hairpin, bringing the two catalytic domains into an active dimerized state. Mutations in the helical domain of Cya mimic the disease-related mutations in human proteins, recapitulating the profiles of the corresponding mutated enzymes, adenylyl cyclase-5 and retinal guanylyl cyclase-1. Our experiments with full-length Cya and its cytosolic domain link the mutations to protein stability, and the ability to induce an active dimeric conformation of the catalytic domains. Sequence conservation indicates that this domain is an integral part of cyclase machinery across protein families and species. Our study provides evidence for a role of the helical domain in establishing a catalytically competent dimeric cyclase conformation. Our results also suggest that the disease-associated mutations in the corresponding regions of human nucleotidyl cyclases disrupt the normal helical domain structure.",

    "articleAbstract": "As global climate warms and sea level rises, coastal areas will be subject to more frequent extreme flooding and hurricanes. Geologic evidence for extreme coastal storms during past warm periods has the potential to provide fundamental insights into their future intensity. Recent studies argue that during the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e, ∼128-116 ka) tropical and extratropical North Atlantic cyclones may have been more intense than at present, and may have produced waves larger than those observed historically. Such strong swells are inferred to have created a number of geologic features that can be observed today along the coastlines of Bermuda and the Bahamas. In this paper, we investigate the most iconic among these features: massive boulders atop a cliff in North Eleuthera, Bahamas. We combine geologic field surveys, wave models, and boulder transport equations to test the hypothesis that such boulders must have been emplaced by storms of greater-than-historical intensity. By contrast, our results suggest that with the higher relative sea level (RSL) estimated for the Bahamas during MIS 5e, boulders of this size could have been transported by waves generated by storms of historical intensity. Thus, while the megaboulders of Eleuthera cannot be used as geologic proof for past \"superstorms,\" they do show that with rising sea levels, cliffs and coastal barriers will be subject to significantly greater erosional energy, even without changes in storm intensity.",

    "articleAbstract": "The 20S proteasome core particle (20S CP) plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis by degrading proteins no longer required for function. The process is, in part, controlled via gating residues localized to the ends of the heptameric barrel-like CP structure that occlude substrate entry pores, preventing unregulated degradation of substrates that might otherwise enter the proteasome. Previously, we showed that the N-terminal residues of the α-subunits of the CP from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum are arranged such that, on average, two of the seven termini are localized inside the lumen of the proteasome, thereby plugging the entry pore and functioning as a gate. However, the mechanism of gating remains unclear. Using solution NMR and a labeling procedure in which a series of mixed proteasome rings are prepared such that the percentage of gate-containing subunits is varied, we address the energetics of gating and establish whether gating is a cooperative process involving the concerted action of residues from more than a single protomer. Our results establish that the intrinsic probability of a gate entering the lumen favors the in state by close to 20-fold, that entry of each gate is noncooperative, with the number of gates that can be accommodated inside the lumen a function of the substrate entry pore size and the bulkiness of the gating residues. Insight into the origin of the high affinity for the in state is obtained from spin-relaxation experiments. More generally, our approach provides an avenue for dissecting interactions of individual protomers in homo-oligomeric complexes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Dense colloidal suspensions can propagate and absorb large mechanical stresses, including impacts and shocks. The wave transport stems from the delicate interplay between the spatial arrangement of the structural units and solvent-mediated effects. For dynamic microscopic systems, elastic deformations of the colloids are usually disregarded due to the damping imposed by the surrounding fluid. Here, we study the propagation of localized mechanical pulses in aqueous monolayers of micron-sized particles of controlled microstructure. We generate extreme localized deformation rates by exciting a target particle via pulsed-laser ablation. In crystalline monolayers, stress propagation fronts take place, where fast-moving particles (V approximately a few meters per second) are aligned along the symmetry axes of the lattice. Conversely, more viscous solvents and disordered structures lead to faster and isotropic energy absorption. Our results demonstrate the accessibility of a regime where elastic collisions also become relevant for suspensions of microscopic particles, behaving as \"billiard balls\" in a liquid, in analogy with regular packings of macroscopic spheres. We furthermore quantify the scattering of an impact as a function of the local structural disorder.",

    "articleAbstract": "Decades of work in experimental animals has established the importance of visual experience during critical periods for the development of normal sensory-evoked responses in the visual cortex. However, much less is known concerning the impact of early visual experience on the systems-level organization of spontaneous activity. Human resting-state fMRI has revealed that infraslow fluctuations in spontaneous activity are organized into stereotyped spatiotemporal patterns across the entire brain. Furthermore, the organization of spontaneous infraslow activity (ISA) is plastic in that it can be modulated by learning and experience, suggesting heightened sensitivity to change during critical periods. Here we used wide-field optical intrinsic signal imaging in mice to examine whole-cortex spontaneous ISA patterns. Using monocular or binocular visual deprivation, we examined the effects of critical period visual experience on the development of ISA correlation and latency patterns within and across cortical resting-state networks. Visual modification with monocular lid suturing reduced correlation between left and right cortices (homotopic correlation) within the visual network, but had little effect on internetwork correlation. In contrast, visual deprivation with binocular lid suturing resulted in increased visual homotopic correlation and increased anti-correlation between the visual network and several extravisual networks, suggesting cross-modal plasticity. These network-level changes were markedly attenuated in mice with genetic deletion of Arc, a gene known to be critical for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Taken together, our results suggest that critical period visual experience induces global changes in spontaneous ISA relationships, both within the visual network and across networks, through an Arc-dependent mechanism.",

    "articleAbstract": "We propose a hitherto-unexplored concept in quantum thermodynamics: catalysis of heat-to-work conversion by quantum nonlinear pumping of the piston mode which extracts work from the machine. This concept is analogous to chemical reaction catalysis: Small energy investment by the catalyst (pump) may yield a large increase in heat-to-work conversion. Since it is powered by thermal baths, the catalyzed machine adheres to the Carnot bound, but may strongly enhance its efficiency and power compared with its noncatalyzed counterparts. This enhancement stems from the increased ability of the squeezed piston to store work. Remarkably, the fraction of piston energy that is convertible into work may then approach unity. The present machine and its counterparts powered by squeezed baths share a common feature: Neither is a genuine heat engine. However, a squeezed pump that catalyzes heat-to-work conversion by small investment of work is much more advantageous than a squeezed bath that simply transduces part of the work invested in its squeezing into work performed by the machine.",

    "articleAbstract": "Bacterial chromosome (nucleoid) conformation dictates faithful regulation of gene transcription. The conformation is condition-dependent and is guided by several nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) and at least one nucleoid-associated noncoding RNA, naRNA4. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of how naRNA4 and the major NAP, HU, acting together organize the chromosome structure by establishing multiple DNA-DNA contacts (DNA condensation). We demonstrate that naRNA4 uniquely acts by forming complexes that may not involve long stretches of DNA-RNA hybrid. Also, uncommonly, HU, a chromosome-associated protein that is essential in the DNA-RNA interactions, is not present in the final complex. Thus, HU plays a catalytic (chaperone) role in the naRNA4-mediated DNA condensation process.",

    "articleAbstract": "In tonal languages such as Chinese, lexical tone with varying pitch contours serves as a key feature to provide contrast in word meaning. Similar to phoneme processing, behavioral studies have suggested that Chinese tone is categorically perceived. However, its underlying neural mechanism remains poorly understood. By conducting cortical surface recordings in surgical patients, we revealed a cooperative cortical network along with its dynamics responsible for this categorical perception. Based on an oddball paradigm, we found amplified neural dissimilarity between cross-category tone pairs, rather than between within-category tone pairs, over cortical sites covering both the ventral and dorsal streams of speech processing. The bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) exhibited increased response latencies and enlarged neural dissimilarity, suggesting a ventral hierarchy that gradually differentiates the acoustic features of lexical tones. In addition, the bilateral motor cortices were also found to be involved in categorical processing, interacting with both the STG and the MTG and exhibiting a response latency in between. Moreover, the motor cortex received enhanced Granger causal influence from the semantic hub, the anterior temporal lobe, in the right hemisphere. These unique data suggest that there exists a distributed cooperative cortical network supporting the categorical processing of lexical tone in tonal language speakers, not only encompassing a bilateral temporal hierarchy that is shared by categorical processing of phonemes but also involving intensive speech-motor interactions over the right hemisphere, which might be the unique machinery responsible for the reliable discrimination of tone identities.",

    "articleAbstract": "The ultimate aim of flow sensing is to represent the perturbations of the medium perfectly. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution resulted in hair-based flow sensors in terrestrial arthropods that stand out among the most sensitive biological sensors known, even better than photoreceptors which can detect a single photon (10(-18)-10(-19) J) of visible light. These tiny sensory hairs can move with a velocity close to that of the surrounding air at frequencies near their mechanical resonance, despite the low viscosity and low density of air. No man-made technology to date demonstrates comparable efficiency. Here we show that nanodimensional spider silk captures fluctuating airflow with maximum physical efficiency (Vsilk/Vair ∼ 1) from 1 Hz to 50 kHz, providing an effective means for miniaturized flow sensing. Our mathematical model shows excellent agreement with experimental results for silk with various diameters: 500 nm, 1.6 µm, and 3 µm. When a fiber is sufficiently thin, it can move with the medium flow perfectly due to the domination of forces applied to it by the medium over those associated with its mechanical properties. These results suggest that the aerodynamic property of silk can provide an airborne acoustic signal to a spider directly, in addition to the well-known substrate-borne information. By modifying a spider silk to be conductive and transducing its motion using electromagnetic induction, we demonstrate a miniature, directional, broadband, passive, low-cost approach to detect airflow with full fidelity over a frequency bandwidth that easily spans the full range of human hearing, as well as that of many other mammals.",

    "articleAbstract": "The hydrogen evolution reaction, as catalyzed by two electrocatalysts [M(N2S2)·Fe(NO)2](+), [Fe-Fe](+) (M = Fe(NO)) and [Ni-Fe](+) (M = Ni) was investigated by computational chemistry. As nominal models of hydrogenase active sites, these bimetallics feature two kinds of actor ligands: Hemilabile, MN2S2 ligands and redox-active, nitrosyl ligands, whose interplay guides the H2 production mechanism. The requisite base and metal open site are masked in the resting state but revealed within the catalytic cycle by cleavage of the MS-Fe(NO)2 bond from the hemilabile metallodithiolate ligand. Introducing two electrons and two protons to [Ni-Fe](+) produces H2 from coupling a hydride temporarily stored on Fe(NO)2 (Lewis acid) and a proton accommodated on the exposed sulfur of the MN2S2 thiolate (Lewis base). This Lewis acid-base pair is initiated and preserved by disrupting the dative donation through protonation on the thiolate or reduction on the thiolate-bound metal. Either manipulation modulates the electron density of the pair to prevent it from reestablishing the dative bond. The electron-buffering nitrosyl's role is subtler as a bifunctional electron reservoir. With more nitrosyls as in [Fe-Fe](+), accumulated electronic space in the nitrosyls' π*-orbitals makes reductions easier, but redirects the protonation and reduction to sites that postpone the actuation of the hemilability. Additionally, two electrons donated from two nitrosyl-buffered irons, along with two external electrons, reduce two protons into two hydrides, from which reductive elimination generates H2.",

    "articleAbstract": "During biofilm formation, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae produce an extracellular matrix consisting of curli amyloid fibers and cellulose. The precursor of curli fibers is the amyloidogenic protein CsgA. The human systemic amyloid precursor protein transthyretin (TTR) is known to inhibit amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation in vitro and suppress the Alzheimer's-like phenotypes in a transgenic mouse model of Aβ deposition. We hypothesized that TTR might have broad antiamyloid activity because the biophysical properties of amyloids are largely conserved across species and kingdoms. Here, we report that both human WT tetrameric TTR (WT-TTR) and its engineered nontetramer-forming monomer (M-TTR, F87M/L110M) inhibit CsgA amyloid formation in vitro, with M-TTR being the more efficient inhibitor. Preincubation of WT-TTR with small molecules that occupy the T4 binding site eliminated the inhibitory capacity of the tetramer; however, they did not significantly compromise the ability of M-TTR to inhibit CsgA amyloidogenesis. TTR also inhibited amyloid-dependent biofilm formation in two different bacterial species with no apparent bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. These discoveries suggest that TTR is an effective antibiofilm agent that could potentiate antibiotic efficacy in infections associated with significant biofilm formation.",

    "articleAbstract": "Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue plays a key role in obesity-induced insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying obesity-induced inflammation remain elusive. Here we show that obesity promotes mtDNA release into the cytosol, where it triggers inflammatory responses by activating the DNA-sensing cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway. Fat-specific knockout of disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), a chaperone-like protein originally identified in the mitochondrial matrix, impaired mitochondrial function and promoted mtDNA release, leading to activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and inflammatory responses. Conversely, fat-specific overexpression of DsbA-L protected mice against high-fat diet-induced activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and inflammation. Taken together, we identify DsbA-L as a key molecule that maintains mitochondrial integrity. DsbA-L deficiency promotes inflammation and insulin resistance by activating the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway. Our study also reveals that, in addition to its well-characterized roles in innate immune surveillance, the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway plays an important role in mediating obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction.",

Here, we utilized the mapping of ribosome footprints on RNAs to explore translational regulation of coding and noncoding RNAs in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana shifted from replete to deficient phosphorous (Pi) nutrition. Homodirectional changes in steady-state mRNA abundance and translation were observed for all but 265 annotated protein-coding genes. Of the translationally regulated mRNAs, 30% had one or more upstream ORF (uORF) that influenced the number of ribosomes on the principal protein-coding region. Nearly one-half of the 2,382 lncRNAs detected had ribosome footprints, including 56 with significantly altered translation under Pi-limited nutrition. The prediction of translated small ORFs (sORFs) by quantitation of translation termination and peptidic analysis identified lncRNAs that produce peptides, including several deeply evolutionarily conserved and significantly Pi-regulated lncRNAs. Furthermore, we discovered that natural antisense transcripts (NATs) frequently have actively translated sORFs, including five with low-Pi up-regulation that correlated with enhanced translation of the sense protein-coding mRNA. The data also confirmed translation of miRNA target mimics and lncRNAs that produce trans-acting or phased small-interfering RNA (tasiRNA/phasiRNAs). Mutational analyses of the positionally conserved sORF of TAS3a linked its translation with tasiRNA biogenesis. Altogether, this systematic analysis of ribosome-associated mRNAs and lncRNAs demonstrates that nutrient availability and translational regulation controls protein and small peptide-encoding mRNAs as well as a diverse cadre of regulatory RNAs.",

    "articleAbstract": "Lithium, with its high theoretical specific capacity and lowest electrochemical potential, has been recognized as the ultimate negative electrode material for next-generation lithium-based high-energy-density batteries. However, a key challenge that has yet to be overcome is the inferior reversibility of Li plating and stripping, typically thought to be related to the uncontrollable morphology evolution of the Li anode during cycling. Here we show that Li-metal texturing (preferential crystallographic orientation) occurs during electrochemical deposition, which governs the morphological change of the Li anode. X-ray diffraction pole-figure analysis demonstrates that the texture of Li deposits is primarily dependent on the type of additive or cross-over molecule from the cathode side. With adsorbed additives, like LiNO3 and polysulfide, the lithium deposits are strongly textured, with Li (110) planes parallel to the substrate, and thus exhibit uniform, rounded morphology. A growth diagram of lithium deposits is given to connect various texture and morphology scenarios for different battery electrolytes. This understanding of lithium electrocrystallization from the crystallographic point of view provides significant insight for future lithium anode materials design in high-energy-density batteries.",

    "articleAbstract": "CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a well-known E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions as a central regulator of plant growth and photomorphogenic development in plants, including hypocotyl elongation. It has been well-established that, in darkness, COP1 targets many photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleus. However, increasing evidence has shown that a proportion of COP1 is also localized outside the nucleus in dark-grown seedlings, but the physiological function of this localization remains largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that COP1 directly targets and mediates the degradation of WAVE-DAMPENED 2-LIKE 3 (WDL3) protein, a member of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) WVD2/WDL family involved in regulating hypocotyl cell elongation of Arabidopsis seedlings. We show that COP1 interacts with WDL3 in vivo in a dark-dependent manner at cortical microtubules. Moreover, our data indicate that COP1 directly ubiquitinates WDL3 in vitro and that WDL3 protein is degraded in WT seedlings but is abundant in the cop1 mutant in the dark. Consistently, introduction of the wdl3 mutation weakened, whereas overexpression of WDL3 enhanced, the short-hypocotyl phenotype of cop1 mutant in darkness. Together, this study reveals a function of COP1 in regulating the protein turnover of a cytosol-localized MAP in etiolated hypocotyls, thus providing insights into COP1-mediated degradation of downstream factors to control seedling photomorphogenesis.",

    "articleAbstract": "Pathogens can exert a large influence on the evolution of hosts via selection for alleles or genotypes that moderate pathogen virulence. Inconsistent interactions between parasites and the host genome, such as those resulting from genetic linkages and environmental stochasticity, have largely prevented observation of this process in wildlife species. We examined the prion protein gene (PRNP) in North American elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) populations that have been infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD), a contagious, fatal prion disease, and compared allele frequency to populations with no history of exposure to CWD. The PRNP in elk is highly conserved and a single polymorphism at codon 132 can markedly extend CWD latency when the minor leucine allele (132L) is present. We determined population exposure to CWD, genotyped 1,018 elk from five populations, and developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the relationship between CWD prevalence and PRNP 132L allele frequency. Populations infected with CWD for at least 30-50 y exhibited 132L allele frequencies that were on average twice as great (range = 0.23-0.29) as those from uninfected populations (range = 0.04-0.17). Despite numerous differences between the elk populations in this study, the consistency of increase in 132L allele frequency suggests pathogen-mediated selection has occurred due to CWD. Although prior modeling work predicted that selection will continue, the potential for fitness costs of the 132L allele or new prion protein strains to arise suggest that it is prudent to assume balancing selection may prevent fixation of the 132L allele in populations with CWD.",

    "articleAbstract": "Pluripotent stem cell-derived human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) provide important opportunities to study primordial germ cells (PGCs). We robustly produced CD38(+) hPGCLCs [∼43% of FACS-sorted embryoid body (EB) cells] from primed-state induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) after a 72-hour transient incubation in the four chemical inhibitors (4i)-naïve reprogramming medium and showed transcriptional consistency of our hPGCLCs with hPGCLCs generated in previous studies using various and distinct protocols. Both CD38(+) hPGCLCs and CD38(-) EB cells significantly expressed PRDM1 and TFAP2C, although PRDM1 mRNA in CD38(-) cells lacked the 3'-UTR harboring miRNA binding sites regulating mRNA stability. Genes up-regulated in hPGCLCs were enriched for cell migration genes, and their promoters were enriched for the binding motifs of TFAP2 (which was identified in promoters of T, NANOS3, and SOX17) and the RREB-1 cell adhesion regulator. In EBs, hPGCLCs were identified exclusively in the outermost surface monolayer as dispersed cells or cell aggregates with strong and specific expression of POU5F1/OCT4 protein. Time-lapse live cell imaging revealed active migration of hPGCLCs on Matrigel. Whereas all hPGCLCs strongly expressed the CXCR4 chemotaxis receptor, its ligand CXCL12/SDF1 was not significantly expressed in the whole EBs. Exposure of hPGCLCs to CXCL12/SDF1 induced cell migration genes and antiapoptosis genes. Thus, our study shows that transcriptionally consistent hPGCLCs can be readily produced from hiPSCs after transition of their pluripotency from the primed state using various methods and that hPGCLCs resemble the early-stage PGCs randomly migrating in the midline region of human embryos before initiation of the CXCL12/SDF1-guided chemotaxis.",

    "articleAbstract": "The ferric-uptake regulator (Fur) is an Fe(2+)-responsive transcription factor that coordinates iron homeostasis in many bacteria. Recently, we reported that expression of the Escherichia coli Fur regulon is also impacted by O2 tension. Here, we show that for most of the Fur regulon, Fur binding and transcriptional repression increase under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that Fur is controlled by O2 availability. We found that the intracellular, labile Fe(2+) pool was higher under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic conditions, suggesting that higher Fe(2+) availability drove the formation of more Fe(2+)-Fur and, accordingly, more DNA binding. O2 regulation of Fur activity required the anaerobically induced FeoABC Fe(2+) uptake system, linking increased Fur activity to ferrous import under iron-sufficient conditions. The increased activity of Fur under anaerobic conditions led to a decrease in expression of ferric import systems. However, the combined positive regulation of the feoABC operon by ArcA and FNR partially antagonized Fur-mediated repression of feoABC under anaerobic conditions, allowing ferrous transport to increase even though Fur is more active. This design feature promotes a switch from ferric import to the more physiological relevant ferrous iron under anaerobic conditions. Taken together, we propose that the influence of O2 availability on the levels of active Fur adds a previously undescribed layer of regulation in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis.",

    "articleAbstract": "Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) is one of the smallest viruses known. Its genome encodes only its coat protein (CP) subunit, relying on the polymerase of its helper virus TNV for replication. The genome has been shown to contain a cryptic set of dispersed assembly signals in the form of stem-loops that each present a minimal CP-binding motif AXXA in the loops. The genomic fragment encompassing nucleotides 1-127 is predicted to contain five such packaging signals (PSs). We have used mutagenesis to determine the critical assembly features in this region. These include the CP-binding motif, the relative placement of PS stem-loops, their number, and their folding propensity. CP binding has an electrostatic contribution, but assembly nucleation is dominated by the recognition of the folded PSs in the RNA fragment. Mutation to remove all AXXA motifs in PSs throughout the genome yields an RNA that is unable to assemble efficiently. In contrast, when a synthetic 127-nt fragment encompassing improved PSs is swapped onto the RNA otherwise lacking CP recognition motifs, assembly is partially restored, although the virus-like particles created are incomplete, implying that PSs outside this region are required for correct assembly. Swapping this improved region into the wild-type STNV1 sequence results in a better assembly substrate than the viral RNA, producing complete capsids and outcompeting the wild-type genome in head-to-head competition. These data confirm details of the PS-mediated assembly mechanism for STNV and identify an efficient approach for production of stable virus-like particles encapsidating nonnative RNAs or other cargoes.",

    "articleAbstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are considered to function primarily at the plasma membrane, where they interact with extracellular ligands and couple to G proteins that transmit intracellular signals. Consequently, therapeutic drugs are designed to target GPCRs at the plasma membrane. Activated GPCRs undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Whether GPCRs in endosomes control pathophysiological processes in vivo and are therapeutic targets remains uncertain. We investigated the contribution of endosomal signaling of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) to pain transmission. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) stimulated CLR endocytosis and activated protein kinase C (PKC) in the cytosol and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytosol and nucleus. Inhibitors of clathrin and dynamin prevented CLR endocytosis and activation of cytosolic PKC and nuclear ERK, which derive from endosomal CLR. A cholestanol-conjugated antagonist, CGRP8-37, accumulated in CLR-containing endosomes and selectively inhibited CLR signaling in endosomes. CGRP caused sustained excitation of neurons in slices of rat spinal cord. Inhibitors of dynamin, ERK, and PKC suppressed persistent neuronal excitation. CGRP8-37-cholestanol, but not unconjugated CGRP8-37, prevented sustained neuronal excitation. When injected intrathecally to mice, CGRP8-37-cholestanol inhibited nociceptive responses to intraplantar injection of capsaicin, formalin, or complete Freund's adjuvant more effectively than unconjugated CGRP8-37 Our results show that CLR signals from endosomes to control pain transmission and identify CLR in endosomes as a therapeutic target for pain. Thus, GPCRs function not only at the plasma membrane but also in endosomes to control complex processes in vivo. Endosomal GPCRs are a drug target that deserve further attention.",

    "articleAbstract": "Several anticancer agents that form DNA adducts in the minor groove interfere with DNA replication and transcription to induce apoptosis. Therapeutic resistance can occur, however, when cells are proficient in the removal of drug-induced damage. Acylfulvenes are a class of experimental anticancer agents with a unique repair profile suggesting their capacity to stall RNA polymerase (Pol) II and trigger transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Here we show how different forms of DNA alkylation impair transcription by RNA Pol II in cells and with the isolated enzyme and unravel a mode of RNA Pol II stalling that is due to alkylation of DNA in the minor groove. We incorporated a model for acylfulvene adducts, the stable 3-deaza-3-methoxynaphtylethyl-adenosine analog (3d-Napht-A), and smaller 3-deaza-adenosine analogs, into DNA oligonucleotides to assess RNA Pol II transcription elongation in vitro. RNA Pol II was strongly blocked by a 3d-Napht-A analog but bypassed smaller analogs. Crystal structure analysis revealed that a DNA base containing 3d-Napht-A can occupy the +1 templating position and impair closing of the trigger loop in the Pol II active center and polymerase translocation into the next template position. These results show how RNA Pol II copes with minor-groove DNA alkylation and establishes a mechanism for drug resistance.",

    "articleAbstract": "Kinesin walks processively on microtubules (MTs) in an asymmetric hand-over-hand manner consuming one ATP molecule per 16-nm step. The individual contributions due to docking of the approximately 13-residue neck linker to the leading head (deemed to be the power stroke) and diffusion of the trailing head (TH) that contributes in propelling the motor by 16 nm have not been quantified. We use molecular simulations by creating a coarse-grained model of the MT-kinesin complex, which reproduces the measured stall force as well as the force required to dislodge the motor head from the MT, to show that nearly three-quarters of the step occurs by bidirectional stochastic motion of the TH. However, docking of the neck linker to the leading head constrains the extent of diffusion and minimizes the probability that kinesin takes side steps, implying that both the events are necessary in the motility of kinesin and for the maintenance of processivity. Surprisingly, we find that during a single step, the TH stochastically hops multiple times between the geometrically accessible neighboring sites on the MT before forming a stable interaction with the target binding site with correct orientation between the motor head and the [Formula: see text] tubulin dimer.",

    "articleAbstract": "Plants employ dynamic molecular networks to control development in response to environmental changes, yet the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report the identification of two rice leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, Thermo-Sensitive Genic Male Sterile 10 (TMS10) and its close homolog TMS10-Like (TMS10L), which redundantly function in the maintenance of the tapetal cell layer and microspore/pollen viability under normal temperature conditions with TMS10 playing an essential role in higher temperatures (namely, 28 °C). tms10 displays male sterility under high temperatures but male fertility under low temperatures, and the tms10 tms10l double mutant shows complete male sterility under both high and low temperatures. Biochemical and genetic assays indicate that the kinase activity conferred by the intracellular domain of TMS10 is essential for tapetal degeneration and male fertility under high temperatures. Furthermore, indica or japonica rice varieties that contain mutations in TMS10, created by genetic crosses or genome editing, also exhibit thermo-sensitive genic male sterility. These findings demonstrate that TMS10 and TMS10L act as a key switch in postmeiotic tapetal development and pollen development by buffering environmental temperature changes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms by which plants develop phenotypic plasticity via genotype-environment temperature interaction. TMS10 may be used as a genetic resource for the development of hybrid seed production systems in crops.",

However, the extent to which large-scale networks exhibit their own organized temporal dynamics is unclear. We use an approach designed to find repeating network patterns in whole-brain resting fMRI data, where networks are defined as graphs of interacting brain areas. We find that the transitions between networks are nonrandom, with certain networks more likely to occur after others. Further, this nonrandom sequencing is itself hierarchically organized, revealing two distinct sets of networks, or metastates, that the brain has a tendency to cycle within. One metastate is associated with sensory and motor regions, and the other involves areas related to higher order cognition. Moreover, we find that the proportion of time that a subject spends in each brain network and metastate is a consistent subject-specific measure, is heritable, and shows a significant relationship with cognitive traits.",

    "articleAbstract": "A complete picture of HIV antigenicity during early replication is needed to elucidate the full range of options for controlling infection. Such information is frequently gained through analyses of isolated viral envelope antigens, host CD4 receptors, and cognate antibodies. However, direct examination of viral particles and virus-cell interactions is now possible via advanced microscopy techniques and reagents. Using such methods, we recently determined that CD4-induced (CD4i) transition state epitopes in the HIV surface antigen, gp120, while not exposed on free particles, rapidly become immunoreactive upon virus-cell binding. Here, we use 3D direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to show that certain CD4i epitopes specific to transition state structures are exposed across the surface of cell-bound virions, thus explaining their immunoreactivity. Moreover, such structures and their marker epitopes are dispersed to regions of virions distal to CD4 contact. We further show that the appearance and positioning of distal CD4i exposures is partially dependent on Gag maturation and intact matrix-gp41 interactions within the virion. Collectively, these observations provide a unique perspective of HIV during early replication. These features may define unique insights for understanding how humoral responses target virions and for developing related antiviral countermeasures.",

    "articleAbstract": "Subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex are frequently mutated in human cancers leading to epigenetic dependencies that are therapeutically targetable. The dependency on the polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and EZH2 represents one such vulnerability in tumors with mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunit, SNF5; however, whether this vulnerability extends to other SWI/SNF subunit mutations is not well understood. Here we show that a subset of cancers harboring mutations in the SWI/SNF ATPase, SMARCA4, is sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. EZH2 inhibition results in a heterogenous phenotypic response characterized by senescence and/or apoptosis in different models, and also leads to tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Lower expression of the SMARCA2 paralog was associated with cellular sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in SMARCA4 mutant cancer models, independent of tissue derivation. SMARCA2 is suppressed by PRC2 in sensitive models, and induced SMARCA2 expression can compensate for SMARCA4 and antagonize PRC2 targets. The induction of SMARCA2 in response to EZH2 inhibition is required for apoptosis, but not for growth arrest, through a mechanism involving the derepression of the lysomal protease cathepsin B. Expression of SMARCA2 also delineates EZH2 inhibitor sensitivity for other SWI/SNF complex subunit mutant tumors, including SNF5 and ARID1A mutant cancers. Our data support monitoring SMARCA2 expression as a predictive biomarker for EZH2-targeted therapies in the context of SWI/SNF mutant cancers.",

    "articleAbstract": "Both modern humans (MHs) and Neanderthals successfully settled across western Eurasian cold-climate landscapes. Among the many adaptations considered as essential to survival in such landscapes, changes in the nasal morphology and/or function aimed to humidify and warm the air before it reaches the lungs are of key importance. Unfortunately, the lack of soft-tissue evidence in the fossil record turns difficult any comparative study of respiratory performance. Here, we reconstruct the internal nasal cavity of a Neanderthal plus two representatives of climatically divergent MH populations (southwestern Europeans and northeastern Asians). The reconstruction includes mucosa distribution enabling a realistic simulation of the breathing cycle in different climatic conditions via computational fluid dynamics. Striking across-specimens differences in fluid residence times affecting humidification and warming performance at the anterior tract were found under cold/dry climate simulations. Specifically, the Asian model achieves a rapid air conditioning, followed by the Neanderthals, whereas the European model attains a proper conditioning only around the medium-posterior tract. In addition, quantitative-genetic evolutionary analyses of nasal morphology provided signals of stabilizing selection for MH populations, with the removal of Arctic populations turning covariation patterns compatible with evolution by genetic drift. Both results indicate that, departing from important craniofacial differences existing among Neanderthals and MHs, an advantageous species-specific respiratory performance in cold climates may have occurred in both species. Fluid dynamics and evolutionary biology independently provided evidence of nasal evolution, suggesting that adaptive explanations regarding complex functional phenotypes require interdisciplinary approaches aimed to quantify both performance and evolutionary signals on covariation patterns.",

    "articleAbstract": "Mobility is one of the most important processes shaping spatiotemporal patterns of variation in genetic, morphological, and cultural traits. However, current approaches for inferring past migration episodes in the fields of archaeology and population genetics lack either temporal resolution or formal quantification of the underlying mobility, are poorly suited to spatially and temporally sparsely sampled data, and permit only limited systematic comparison between different time periods or geographic regions. Here we present an estimator of past mobility that addresses these issues by explicitly linking trait differentiation in space and time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this estimator using spatiotemporally explicit simulations and apply it to a large set of ancient genomic data from Western Eurasia. We identify a sequence of changes in human mobility from the Late Pleistocene to the Iron Age. We find that mobility among European Holocene farmers was significantly higher than among European hunter-gatherers both pre- and postdating the Last Glacial Maximum. We also infer that this Holocene rise in mobility occurred in at least three distinct stages: the first centering on the well-known population expansion at the beginning of the Neolithic, and the second and third centering on the beginning of the Bronze Age and the late Iron Age, respectively. These findings suggest a strong link between technological change and human mobility in Holocene Western Eurasia and demonstrate the utility of this framework for exploring changes in mobility through space and time.",

    "articleAbstract": "Most natural populations are affected by seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, or resource availability. Seasonally fluctuating selection could potentially make a large contribution to maintaining genetic polymorphism in populations. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous and homozygous loci-that is, dominance. The second step uses a nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism, which we call \"segregation lift,\" requires seasonal changes in dominance, a phenomenon that may arise naturally in situations with antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative importance of traits for fitness. Segregation lift works best under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected by problems of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often fluctuations may be small and hard to detect. An important direction for future work is to formally test for segregation lift in empirical data and to quantify its contribution to maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.",

    "articleAbstract": "Current theories attribute aging to a failure of selection, due to either pleiotropic constraints or declining strength of selection after the onset of reproduction. These theories implicitly leave open the possibility that if senescence-causing alleles could be identified, or if antagonistic pleiotropy could be broken, the effects of aging might be ameliorated or delayed indefinitely. These theories are built on models of selection between multicellular organisms, but a full understanding of aging also requires examining the role of somatic selection within an organism. Selection between somatic cells (i.e., intercellular competition) can delay aging by purging nonfunctioning cells. However, the fitness of a multicellular organism depends not just on how functional its individual cells are but also on how well cells work together. While intercellular competition weeds out nonfunctional cells, it may also select for cells that do not cooperate. Thus, intercellular competition creates an inescapable double bind that makes aging inevitable in multicellular organisms.",

    "articleAbstract": "Future population growth is uncertain and matters for climate policy: higher growth entails more emissions and means more people will be vulnerable to climate-related impacts. We show that how future population is valued importantly determines mitigation decisions. Using the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, we explore two approaches to valuing population: a discounted version of total utilitarianism (TU), which considers total wellbeing and is standard in social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC) models, and of average utilitarianism (AU), which ignores population size and sums only each time period's discounted average wellbeing. Under both approaches, as population increases the SCC increases, but optimal peak temperature decreases. The effect is larger under TU, because it responds to the fact that a larger population means climate change hurts more people: for example, in 2025, assuming the United Nations (UN)-high rather than UN-low population scenario entails an increase in the SCC of 85% under TU vs. 5% under AU. The difference in the SCC between the two population scenarios under TU is comparable to commonly debated decisions regarding time discounting. Additionally, we estimate the avoided mitigation costs implied by plausible reductions in population growth, finding that large near-term savings ($billions annually) occur under TU; savings under AU emerge in the more distant future. These savings are larger than spending shortfalls for human development policies that may lower fertility. Finally, we show that whether lowering population growth entails overall improvements in wellbeing-rather than merely cost savings-again depends on the ethical approach to valuing population.",

    "articleAbstract": "Antigen discrimination by T cells occurs at the junction between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell. Juxtacrine binding between numerous adhesion, signaling, and costimulatory molecules defines both the topographical and lateral geometry of this cell-cell interface, within which T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) interact. These physical constraints on receptor and ligand movement have significant potential to modulate their molecular binding properties. Here, we monitor individual ligand:receptor binding and unbinding events in space and time by single-molecule imaging in live primary T cells for a range of different pMHC ligands and surface densities. Direct observations of pMHC:TCR and CD80:CD28 binding events reveal that the in situ affinity of both pMHC and CD80 ligands for their respective receptors is modulated by the steady-state number of agonist pMHC:TCR interactions experienced by the cell. By resolving every single pMHC:TCR interaction it is evident that this cooperativity is accomplished by increasing the kinetic on-rate without altering the off-rate and has a component that is not spatially localized. Furthermore, positive cooperativity is observed under conditions where the T cell activation probability is low. This TCR-mediated feedback is a global effect on the intercellular junction. It is triggered by the first few individual pMHC:TCR binding events and effectively increases the efficiency of TCR scanning for antigen before the T cell is committed to activation.",

Here, we demonstrate that commercially available mobile phones are a powerful tool for acoustically mapping mosquito species distributions worldwide. We show that even low-cost mobile phones with very basic functionality are capable of sensitively acquiring acoustic data on species-specific mosquito wingbeat sounds, while simultaneously recording the time and location of the human-mosquito encounter. We survey a wide range of medically important mosquito species, to quantitatively demonstrate how acoustic recordings supported by spatio-temporal metadata enable rapid, non-invasive species identification. As proof-of-concept, we carry out field demonstrations where minimally-trained users map local mosquitoes using their personal phones. Thus, we establish a new paradigm for mosquito surveillance that takes advantage of the existing global mobile network infrastructure, to enable continuous and large-scale data acquisition in resource-constrained areas.",

The Necdin-deficient mouse is the only model that reproduces the respiratory phenotype of PWS (central apnea and blunted response to respiratory challenges). Here, we report that Necdin deletion disturbs the migration of serotonin (5-HT) neuronal precursors, leading to altered global serotonergic neuroarchitecture and increased spontaneous firing of 5-HT neurons. We show an increased expression and activity of 5-HT Transporter (SERT/Slc6a4) in 5-HT neurons leading to an increase of 5-HT uptake. In Necdin-KO pups, the genetic deletion of Slc6a4 or treatment with Fluoxetine, a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, restored normal breathing. Unexpectedly, Fluoxetine administration was associated with respiratory side effects in wild-type animals. Overall, our results demonstrate that an increase of SERT activity is sufficient to cause the apneas in Necdin-KO pups, and that Fluoxetine may offer therapeutic benefits to PWS patients with respiratory complications.",

Combining small RNA sequencing from 179 human serum samples with a neural network analysis produced a miRNA algorithm for diagnosis of EOC (AUC 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-0.99). The model significantly outperformed CA125 and functioned well regardless of patient age, histology, or stage. Among 454 patients with various diagnoses, the miRNA neural network had 100% specificity for ovarian cancer. After using 325 samples to adapt the neural network to qPCR measurements, the model was validated using 51 independent clinical samples, with a positive predictive value of 91.3% (95% CI: 73.3% - 97.6%) and negative predictive value of 78.6% (95% CI: 64.2% - 88.2%). Finally, biologic relevance was tested using in situ hybridization on 30 pre-metastatic lesions, showing intratumoral concentration of relevant miRNAs. These data suggest circulating miRNAs have potential to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for ovarian cancer.",

In Drosophila, the translational repressor Bgcn is required for spermatogonia to stop mitosis and transition to meiotic prophase and the spermatocyte state. Here we show that the mammalian Bgcn ortholog YTHDC2 facilitates a clean switch from mitosis to meiosis in mouse germ cells, revealing a conserved role for YTHDC2 in this critical cell fate transition. YTHDC2-deficient male germ cells enter meiosis but have a mixed identity, maintaining expression of Cyclin A2 and failing to properly express many meiotic markers. Instead of continuing through meiotic prophase, the cells attempt an abnormal mitotic-like division and die. YTHDC2 binds multiple transcripts including Ccna2 and other mitotic transcripts, binds specific piRNA precursors, and interacts with RNA granule components, suggesting that proper progression of germ cells through meiosis is licensed by YTHDC2 through post-transcriptional regulation.",

    "articleAbstract": "THINK Surgical TSolution-One(®) is an active-autonomous, image-based, robotic milling system which enables the surgeon to attain a consistently accurate implant component positioning. The TSolution-One(®) system is capable of achieving this through an image-based preoperative planning system which allows the surgeon to create, view and analyse the surgical outcome in 3D. The accuracy and precision of component positioning have been attributed to the following factors: customized distal femoral resection, accurate determination of the femoral rotational alignment, minimization of errors and maintenance of bone temperature with robotic milling. Despite all these advantages, there is still a paucity of long-term, high-quality data that demonstrates the efficacy of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Questions regarding radiation risks, prolonged surgical duration and cost-effectiveness remain unanswered. This paper aims to describe: (1) TSolution-One(®) surgical technique; (2) limitations and complications; (3) clinical and radiological outcomes.",

They should be separated from extended fractures of the humeral head to the shaft [1].We present the case of an active 84-year-old man who sustained a three-part fracture-dislocation of the proximal humerus combined with a long spiral humeral middle third diaphyseal fracture, after a ski fall. We were unable to find a similar case in the literature. He was treated with a long stem hemiarthroplasty, associated with screw osteosynthesis of the long spiral shaft fracture. The result after 30 months of follow-up was excellent, with good shoulder range of motion, good bone integration of the prosthesis and uneventful healing of the fracture.This treatment allowed this intrepid elderly patient to recover a normal quality of life, including driving his car and to return to skiing.",

    "articleAbstract": "Vasoplegic syndrome is a form of vasodilatory shock that occurs frequently in patients who undergo cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP). Treatment often demands high doses of vasopressors over sustained periods for hypotension that can be refractory to standard vasoactive medications. Furthermore, the development of vasoplegia greatly contributes to morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery. Methylene blue (MB) has become a popular therapy for cardiac vasoplegia despite a paucity of prospective data to direct its use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review available data regarding mechanisms, dosing strategies, and side effects of MB, with a focus on its applications for vasoplegia in cardiac surgery.",

It was difficult to make a conclusive diagnosis using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), because the two high right superior pulmonary veins drained into the superior vena cava and limited the shunt of patent foramen ovale. Preoperative TTE only showed right heart volume overload, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and severe tricuspid valve insufficiency. A chest CT-angiography (angio-CT) finally found the anomalous right superior pulmonary venous connection, which was further confirmed by surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful.",

    "articleAbstract": "The distribution of gene variants in the Turkish Cypriot population with coronary artery disease has not been investigated. In this study, we sought to research different genetic variants in the susceptibility to coronary artery disease and to identify possible associations between various clinical parameters and the genes involved in blood coagulation as well as glucose and lipid metabolism among the Turkish Cypriots and compared the results with the respective Turkish patients from Turkey. Methods: A total of 187 individuals with coronary artery disease, namely 87 Turkish Cypriot individuals from Northern Cyprus, and 100 Turkish patients from Turkey, were investigated. The presence of CAD was documented with coronary angiography. The genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease in the cohorts was studied using the variants FV Leiden (G1691A), Factor V R2 mutation (FVR2)(H1299R), PTH (G20210A), FXIII (V34L), β-Fibrinogen (-455 G>A), PAI-1 (4G/5G), HPA1 (a/b), MTHFR [C677T] and [A1298C], ACE (I/D), Apo B (R3500Q), and Apo E, in addition to the well-known risk factors associated with coronary artery disease.Age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, triglycerides, HDL, and triglyceride/HDL ratio were significantly associated with (P < .05); LDL (P = .05) and total cholesterol (P = .08) was marginally associated with coronary artery disease in the Turkish Cypriot population. The mutations in the MTHFR [C677T] gene variant were marginally higher in the Turkish Cypriot cohort when compared with the Turkish patients from Turkey (P = .06). No significant direct association of any of the gene variants with coronary artery disease in the Turkish Cypriot cohort could be defined. Several of the genetic variants were associated indirectly with the risk factors for coronary artery disease in Turkish Cypriots. MTHFR [A1298C] was found to be marginally associated with low HDL cholesterol (P = .08). MTHFR [C677] wild-type allele was significantly associated with a decreased rate of high LDL cholesterol (P < .05). The HPA-1 a/b variant was significantly associated with an increased rate of high total cholesterol levels (P < .05). Conclusion: Turkish Cypriot patients with coronary artery disease may be more affected by secondary factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and sedentary life style when compared with genetic factors, which may be responsible for coronary artery disease.",

    "articleAbstract": "Strain 10R5-21(T) was isolated from lagoon sediments. Cells of strain 10R5-21(T) were Gram-reaction-negative, rod-shaped and motile by means of polar flagella. The strain was obligately aerobic and positive for catalase and oxidase activity. Strain 10R5-21(T) was able to grow at 10-37 ˚C (optimum 25-30 ˚C), at pH 5.0-9.0 (optimum pH 6.5-7.5) and in the presence of 0-0.5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0 %). C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c, C16 : 0 and C12 : 0 were present as predominant (>5 %) fatty acids. Q-8 was identified as the major respiratory quinone. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine were present as major polar lipids with minor amounts of unidentified aminophospholipids and unidentified aminolipids. The genomic G+C content of strain 10R5-21(T) was 64.1 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain 10R5-21(T) belongs to the genus Pseudoduganella within the family Oxalobacteraceae of the class Betaproteobacteria. Strain 10R5-21(T) shared 98.8 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Pseudoduganella violaceinigra YIM 31327(T). DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain 10R5-21(T) and P. violaceinigra KACC 11669(T) were clearly below the 70 % threshold. Distinct morphological, biochemical, chemotaxonomic and genetic differences from previously described taxa support the classification of strain 10R5-21(T) as a representative of a novel species in the genus Pseudoduganella, for which the name Pseudoduganella eburnea sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 10R5-21(T) (=KEMB 563-061(T)=JCM 31587(T)).",

This taxon was formerly a subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae, but was reclassified in 2016 as a family with two genera, Orthopneumovirus and Metapneumovirus. Pneumoviruses infect a range of mammalian species, while some members of the Metapneumovirus genus may also infect birds. Some viruses are specific and pathogenic for humans, such as human respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus. There are no known vectors for pneumoviruses and transmission is thought to be primarily by aerosol droplets and contact.

    "articleAbstract": "During the phylogenetic analysis of the genus Sphingopyxis, we found that an incorrect 16S rRNA gene sequence (accession number: D13727) was provided in the original description of Sphingopyxisterrae NBRC 15098(T) and the wrong sequence has been adopted and used for a long time. It should be replaced by the new correct 16S rRNA gene sequence (accession number: MF618306). The new sequence shared the highest similarity (99.8 %) with that of Sphingopyxisummariensis DSM 24316(T). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) (96.87 %) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (75.30 %) values based on the whole-genome sequences and almost the same phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the two type strains revealed thatSphingopyxisummariensis should be a later heterotypic synonym ofSphingopyxisterrae. However, the distinctions in the genome size, hydrolysis of aesculin, α-glucosidase and particularly the fatty acid profiles strongly support that strain DSM 24316(T) should be considered to represent a novel subspecies ofSphingopyxisterrae. Two novel subspecies are therefore proposed, namely Sphingopyxisterraesubsp. terrae subsp. nov. (type strain E-1-A(T)=NBRC 15098(T)=JCM 10195(T)=DSM 8831(T)=LMG 17326(T)) and Sphingopyxisterraesubsp. ummariensis subsp. nov. (type strain UI2(T)=DSM 24316(T)=CCM 7428(T)=MTCC 8591(T)).",

    "articleAbstract": "A novel streptomycete, strain 594(T), isolated from Brazilian soil collected under cerrado (savanna) vegetation cover is described. Strain 594(T) produced thermophilic chitinolytic proteases in assays containing feather meal and corn steep liquor as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. The strain produced white to grey aerial mycelium and spiral chains of spiny-surfaced spores on the aerial mycelium and did not produce diffusible pigments. The ll-isomer of diaminopimelic acid was present in the cell wall and menaquinones were predominantly MK-9(H6) (52 %) and MK-9(H8) (30 %) with 6 % MK-9(H4) and slightly less than 1 % MK-9(H2). Polar lipids present were phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unknown phospholipid. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C16 : 0, anteiso-C14 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 70.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that it differed from described Streptomyces species. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using five housekeeping genes (atpD, gyrB, rpoB, recA and trpB) comparing Streptomyces type strains showed that the MLSA distance of strain 594(T) to the most closely related species was greater than the 0.007 threshold. The in silico DNA-DNA relatedness between the genome sequence of strain 594(T) and that of the phylogenetically nearest species was well below the species level recommendation. There was thus multiple evidence justifying the description of this strain as representing a novel species, for which the name Streptomyces odonnellii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 594(T) (=IMPPG 594(T)=DSM 41949(T)=NRRL B-24891(T)).",

    "articleAbstract": "Praxelis clematidea is a very vigorous non-native weed in tropical and subtropical regions of China. P. clematidea plants showing symptoms of phyllody disease were found in an orchard located in Hainan province, PR China. The presence of phytoplasmas was confirmed by PCR of 16S rRNA gene using phytoplasma universal primers R16mF2/R16mR1 followed by R16F2n/R16R2. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the P. clematidea phyllody (PCP) phytoplasma is a 'CandidatusPhytoplasma australasiae'-related strain (99.5 % similarity). The virtual RFLP pattern analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the PCP is a new subgroup within 16 Sr group II. The most similar RFLP pattern is the reference pattern of 16Sr group II, subgroup M, with a similarity coefficient of 0.94. These results were confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene. These findings suggest that P. clematidea phyllody disease is caused by a new phytoplasma considered to be a novel subgroup, 16SrII-V.",

    "articleAbstract": "Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) causes significant economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide. Previously, we demonstrated that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) can inhibit BVDV replication via an unknown molecular mechanism. To elucidate the mechanism involved, we assess whether the HO-1 downstream metabolites carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin (BV) and iron affect BVDV replication. We treated Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells with an exogenous CO donor, CORM-2. We found that CORM-2 but not its inactive form (iCORM-2) inhibited BVDV replication in a dose-dependent and time duration-dependent manner, suggesting a CO-specific mediation of the CORM-2 antiviral effect. Direct incubation of BVDV with high-dose CORM-2 reduced virus titres, suggesting that CORM-2 attenuates BVDV growth by both physically inactivating virus particles in the extracellular environment and affecting intracellular BVDV replication, but mainly via an intracellular mechanism. Exogenous BV treatment, both post-infection and co-incubation with BVDV, inhibited BVDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that BV has potent antiviral activity against BVDV. Direct incubation of BVDV with BV had no significant effect on virus titres, indicating that BV is not virucidal and attenuates BVDV growth by affecting intracellular BVDV replication. Furthermore, BV was found to affect BVDV penetration but not attachment. However, increased iron via addition of FeCl3 did not interfere with BVDV replication. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrate that the HO-1 metabolites BV and CO, but not iron, inhibit BVDV replication. These findings not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of HO-1 inhibition of BVDV replication but also suggest potential new control measures for future BVDV infection.",

    "articleAbstract": "Data regarding the incidence and molecular epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) in Greece are limited.A retrospective study of all laboratory-confirmed CDI cases in a university hospital during a 9-month period. Stool samples from inpatients with diarrhoea were tested with a combined glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test, as part of a two-step algorithm for CDI testing. All GDH-positive samples were cultured and isolates were further tested for the presence of toxin genes and characterized by PCR ribotyping.The incidence of CDI in our hospital was 25 per 10 000 hospital admissions. Of 33 CDI cases, 72.7 % were hospital-acquired. Fourteen different PCR ribotypes were identified, of which 017 (21.2 %), 078/126 (15.1 %) and RT202 and RT106 (9 %) were the most prevalent. Most patients had a risk profile of recent antibiotic use, older age and comorbidities. Despite mild CDI clinical characteristics, six cases showed complications and led to 18.2 % mortality.The CDI incidence was comparable to that in other European countries. The hypervirulent PCR ribotype 027 was not found, whereas ribotypes 017 and 126 predominated. Most CDI cases were in patients who used antibiotics, emphasizing that antimicrobial stewardship should be considered as a cornerstone for the prevention of CDI.",

Both strains were yellow, Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped bacteria. These strains were non-sporulating, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. J77-1(T) and J76-1 were able to grow at 15-40 °C, pH 5.0-10.0, and 0-1.0 % (w/v) NaCl concentration. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that both strains formed a distinct separate lineage within the family Cytophagaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes. J77-1(T) and J76-1 showed low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the most closely related type strain Dyadobacter koreensis WPCB159(T) (85.09 %) and exhibited less than 85.0 % sequence similarity with other members of the family Cytophagaceae. The pairwise sequence similarity between strains J77-1(T) and J76-1 was observed to be 99.86 %. In both strains, the only respiratory quinone was menaquinone-7 (MK-7); the major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine; and the major fatty acids were summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c), C16 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH C16 : 1ω5c, and C16 : 0 3-OH.

On the basis of the results of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic analysis, J77-1(T) represents a novel species of a novel genus, for which the name Ravibacter arvi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed, within the family Cytophagaceae. The type strain of Ravibacter arvi is J77-1(T) (=KEMB 9005-548(T)=KACC 19172(T)=JCM 31920(T)), and J76-1 is an additional strain.",

    "articleAbstract": "A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium, designated B1(T), was isolated from deep-sea sediment collected from the South Atlantic Ocean. Cells of strain B1(T) grew in medium containing 0.5-6.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1.0-2.0 %), at pH 5.5-7.5 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 15-37 °C (optimum 30 °C). Aesculin, starch and Tweens 20, 40 and 60 were hydrolysed. The strain was able to grow in medium containing a high concentration of Co(2+) (10 mM). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain B1(T) shared high similarity with respect to Maribacter orientalis DSM 16471(T) (97.7 %), and exhibited less than 97.0 % sequence similarity with the type strains of other species with validly published names. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that strain B1(T) fell within the cluster comprising Maribacter species and formed an independent lineage. The average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain B1(T) and M. orientalis DSM 16471(T) were 72.0 % and 17.6 %, respectively. Strain B1(T) contained menaquinone 6 (MK-6) as the sole isoprenoid quinone and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C15 : 1 G as the predominant cellular fatty acids. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid and two unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content was 39.7 mol%. According to the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, B1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Maribacter, for which the name Maribacter cobaltidurans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is B1(T) (=CGMCC 1.15508(T)=KCTC 52882(T)=MCCC 1K03318(T)).",

The strain was classified as Microbacterium sp. after the analysis of its peptidoglycan revealed a novel B-type structure established as variation B2δ by Hensel in 1984. As the combination of the peptidoglycan amino acids 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (Dab), threonine (Thr), glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala) and glutamic acid (Glu) is in disagreement with the current genus definition of Microbacterium but is typical of several Leucobacter species, the taxonomic status of strain S27(T) was re-examined by a polyphasic study. Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences and the occurrence of l-Dab, d-Ala, l-Ala, Gly, l-Thr, d-Glu and lower amounts of l-Glu in the peptidoglycan in combination with the predominating menaquinones MK-11, MK-10 and MK-9, phosphatidylglycerol, and one unknown glycolipid as the major polar lipids (and trace amounts of diphosphatidylglycerol and an unknown phospholipid), a profile with anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 as major fatty acids and the G+C value of 70.1 mol% confirmed the affiliation to the genus Leucobacter and revealed that S27(T) (=DSM 20621(T) =CCM 8762(T)) is the type strain of a new species for which the name Leucobacter weissii sp. nov. is proposed.

    "articleAbstract": "A gram-negative, budding, catalase negative, oxidase positive and non-motile bacterium (MBLW1(T)) with a complex endomembrane system has been isolated from a freshwater lake in southeast Queensland, Australia. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis places the strain within the family Planctomycetaceae, related to Zavarzinella formosa (93.3 %), Telmatocola sphagniphila (93.3 %) and Gemmata obscuriglobus (91.9 %). Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis demonstrates considerable differences to the type strains of the related genera. MBLW1(T) displays modest salt tolerance and grows optimally at pH values of 7.5-8.0 and at temperatures of 32-36 °C. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrates the presence of a complex endomembrane system, however, without the typically condensed nucleoid structure found in related genera. The major fatty acids are 16 : 1 ω5c, 16 : 0 and 18 : 0. Based on discriminatory results from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, phenotypic, biochemical and chemotaxonomic analysis, MBLW1(T) should be considered as a new genus and species, for which the name Tuwongella immobilis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MBLW1(T) (=CCUG 69661(T)=DSM 105045(T)).",

Despite the importance of this measurement, there are significant discrepancies in the field on how to quantify expected body weight (EBW). A survey was sent to 113 child and adolescent eating disorder treatment providers inquiring about the methods used to determine weight restoration in their clinical practice. Although 40.7% used growth curve data, the remaining employed a diverse range of approaches. Providers who specialize in Family-Based Treatment were significantly more likely to use an individualized approach versus considering adolescent preference. Although there is a modicum of endorsement for using growth curves to predict EBW, this is not universal practice and is inconsistent with methods used in treatment studies. The lack of an evidence-based method to calculate EBW-or even a best practice consensus for calculating this number-is a major oversight in the field that requires empirical attention.",

All reported disease-causing PRPF8 variants were collected and localized in the PRPF8 and PRPF8/SNRNP200 protein structures.The p.PRPF8-Glu2331* variant results in a truncated PRPF8 protein lacking the last five C-terminal amino acids and caused in the two patients a severe clinical phenotype, with the macula being affected from the second decade on. All but two adRP-linked variants are located in the last exon 43 encoding the C-terminal tail of the C-terminal PRPF8 Jab1 domain. The p.PRPF8-Ser2118Phe and -Asn2280Lys variants encoded by exons 39 and 42, respectively, are located at the basis of the C-terminal tail.Frame-shift mutations and nonconservative amino acid changes in PRPF8 typically cause severe clinical phenotypes. The conservative missense variant p.PRPF8-Arg2310Lys that is not altering the global charge of the C-terminal tail, and variants located at the basis of the C-terminal tail show milder clinical phenotypes, in accordance with functional data on PRPF8/SNRNP200 interactions in yeast.",

Selected GST polymorphisms have been proven to significantly affect enzymatic activity; however, it is unclear whether this altered metabolism influences dietary composition. The objective of this study was to locate the correlation between GST polymorphisms and selected nutritional parameters, namely, fiber and vitamin C intake.This study was conducted on a cohort of 472 individuals (mean age 45.26 years; mean body mass index [BMI] 32.36) from the South Moravian region of the Czech Republic. Basic anthropometrical parameters were measured and no association was found for the selected polymorphisms. Polymorphisms in GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methodology. Food intake was monitored using a self-administered 7-day questionnaire that was subsequently analyzed with a special focus on vitamin C intake, fiber intake, and total energy intake.For GSTA1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms, an association was observed with fiber intake. Though no association was found with vitamin C intake, mean vitamin C intake was found to be higher than recommended daily values. No association was found with either daily energy intake or anthropometric parameters.Based on our results, GST polymorphisms seem to affect dietary composition; however, they have no effect on total energy intake or any association with obesity.",

    "articleAbstract": "The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) functions as a metabo-electric transducer in regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. The pancreatic KATP channel is composed of a pore-forming inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, Kir6.2, and a regulatory subunit, sulphonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). Loss-of-function mutations in either subunit often lead to the development of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI). PHHI is a rare genetic disease and most patients present with immediate onset within the first few days after birth. In this study, we report an unusual form of PHHI, in which the index patient developed hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after 1 year of age. The patient failed to respond to routine medication for PHHI and underwent a complete pancreatectomy. Genotyping of the index patient and his immediate family members showed that the patient and other family members with hypoglycemic episodes carried a heterozygous novel mutation in KCNJ11 (C83T), which encodes Kir6.2 (A28V). Electrophysiological and cell biological experiments revealed that A28V hKir6.2 is a dominant-negative, loss-of-function mutation and that KATP channels carrying this mutation failed to reach the cell surface. de novo protein structure prediction indicated that this A28V mutation reoriented the ER retention motif located at the C-terminal of the hKir6.2, and this result may explain the trafficking defect caused by this point mutation. Our study is the first report of a novel form of late-onset PHHI that is caused by a dominant mutation in KCNJ11 and exhibits a defect in proper surface expression of Kir6.2.",

Antioxidant characteristics of the flavonoids have a significant effect on prevention and treatment of infertility. The aim of the present study was to review studies investigating the effects of pollen, pit powder, and gemmule extract of the date palm on male infertility. Articles that were published about the topic between 2005 and 2016 were reviewed from different databases in Turkish and English. The search engines used included PubMed, Science Direct, Clinical Key, Google Scholar, Springer, Dergipark, Ulakbim, and Akademik Dizin. The studies found that pollen, pit powder, and gemmule extract of the date palm created positive changes in hormone levels that have a role in male fertility and increased sperm motility and quality, spermatogenesis, and weights of testes and epididymis. Date palm pollen, pit powder, and gemmule extract have a high antioxidant capacity because of phenolic formations in the composition. Such characteristics have a positive effect on prevention and treatment of male infertility. Furthermore, gonadotropic and steroidal compounds within date palm pollen play a role in treatment of male infertility. The limited number of studies conducted on this topic indicates that more research is needed.",

    "articleAbstract": "Family-based treatment principles have been incorporated into higher levels of care. However, outcome data for these programs, and, in particular, follow-up data, are limited. The current study assessed 3-month follow-up data for patients in a family-based partial hospitalization/intensive outpatient program. Patients completed measures of eating disorder psychopathology and depression, while parents completed measures of self-efficacy and expressed emotion. With the exception of paternal self-efficacy, all measures stayed the same or improved between end of treatment and follow-up, suggesting that improvements in a family-based higher level of care can be sustained once families step down to less intensive treatment.",

    "articleAbstract": "Previous literature shows possible benefits of whey protein supplementation in promoting weight loss. However, most studies do not have enough power to show beneficial effects on body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. This meta-analysis evaluated effects of whey protein in individuals who are overweight and obese.We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The inclusion criteria were published randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing whey protein supplementation to placebo or controls in individuals who are overweight or obese. The primary outcome was the differences in the change in body composition (body weight, waist circumference, total fat mass, body lean mass). We also examined the changes in CVD risk factors as secondary outcomes. We calculated pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model.Nine RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant reduction of body weight (MD = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.30-0.81), lean mass (MD = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96), and fat mass (MD = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.77-1.47) favoring the whey protein group. There were improvements in multiple CVD risk factors including levels of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol (all p values <0.05).Whey protein supplementation seems to improve body weight, total fat mass, and some CVD risk factors in overweight and obese patients. Further studies regarding optimal dosage and duration of whey protein supplementation would be helpful to assess potential favorable effects in individuals who are overweight or obese.",

The outcome variables were body mass index (BMI)-for-age and waist circumference (WC) and the principal exposure variables were serum Hcy and Cys levels, alone or in conjunction. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach was used to identify longitudinal changes in the outcome variables.Irrespective of age, sex, socioeconomic conditions, dietary intake, or the practice of physical activity, the children and adolescents in the fifth quintile of distribution of Hcy levels had a z-score increase of 0.50 (p < 0.01) and a 3.62 cm increase (p < 0.01) in mean BMI-for-age and WC, respectively, over the period of the study. In individuals with Cys values above the fifth quintile, a z-score increase of 0.59 (p < 0.01) and a 5 cm increase (p < 0.01) were found in BMI-for-age and WC, respectively. When serum Hcy and Cys levels were both above the fifth quintile of distribution, a z-score increase of 0.87 (p < 0.01) and a 6.57 cm increase (p < 0.01) were found in mean BMI-for-age and WC, respectively, over the 12-month follow-up.High serum Hcy and Cys levels contributed to an increase in BMI-for-age and WC in children and adolescents over a 12-month follow-up period, with these increases being even greater when these 2 biochemical parameters were simultaneously high.",

    "articleAbstract": "The aim of this review was to evaluate the impact of vitamin A supplementation on adult pregnant women and women who have just given birth in studies examining serum concentrations of vitamin A in breast milk and in maternal/child morbidity and mortality.This review followed the recommendations in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). In November 2014, an electronic search was independently performed by two authors on the Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS databases on studies published from January 2004 to November 2014. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed in accordance with the Jadad scale, which determines the exclusion of studies with scores lower than 3.It was observed that when supplementation was provided only in the immediate postpartum period, it increased the liver stores of vitamin A. On the other hand, when supplementation was provided during pregnancy and puerperium5, the propensity for depleting the stores of vitamin A at the end of pregnancy decreased, the immune system improved, and cases of gestational night blindness decreased, but there were no changes in the outcomes at childbirth or in maternal, fetal, and child mortality. When supplementation was provided before and during pregnancy and in the immediate postpartum period, an additional improvement of lung function evaluated in preschool-aged children was found, but no significant changes in cognitive and motor development were noted.Studies show the benefits of vitamin A supplementation, not just in the immediate postpartum period but, above all, when it is provided before and/or during pregnancy. Considering the positive repercussions observed, we suggest supplementation both in the gestational period and in the immediate postpartum period as a way to enhance the safety of mother-child care.",

    "articleAbstract": "Purpose To better understand the relationship between exposure to concussive and subconcussive head impacts, white matter integrity, and functional task-related neural activity in former U.S. football athletes. Materials and Methods Between 2011 and 2013, 61 cognitively unimpaired former collegiate and professional football players (age range, 52-65 years) provided informed consent to participate in this cross-sectional study. Participants were stratified across three crossed factors: career duration, concussion history, and primary playing position. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) percent signal change (PSC) were measured with diffusion-weighted and task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Analyses of variance of FA and BOLD PSC were used to determine main or interaction effects of the three factors. Results A significant interaction between career duration and concussion history was observed; former college players with more than three concussions had lower FA in a broadly distributed area of white matter compared with those with zero to one concussion (t29 = 2.774; adjusted P = .037), and the opposite was observed for former professional players (t29 = 3.883; adjusted P = .001). A separate interaction between concussion history and position was observed: Nonspeed players with more than three concussions had lower FA in frontal white matter compared with those with zero to one concussion (t25 = 3.861; adjusted P = .002). Analysis of working memory-task BOLD PSC revealed a similar interaction between concussion history and position (all adjusted P < .004). Overall, former players with lower FA tended to have lower BOLD PSC across three levels of a working memory task. Conclusion Career duration and primary playing position seem to modify the effects of concussion history on white matter structure and neural recruitment. The differences in brain structure and function were observed in the absence of clinical impairment, which suggested that multimodal imaging may provide early markers of onset of traumatic neurodegenerative disease.

On day 7 of each 7-day treatment period, efficacy was assessed during a 16.5-hour postdose period. The primary endpoint, Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) total score, was analyzed in the intent-to-treat population using a mixed linear model of analysis of variance. Secondary endpoints, for which the study was not powered, included PERMP problems attempted and answered correctly, ADHD clinician ratings based on counselor observations and inputs during the Time Segment Rating System (Co-ADHD-RS TSRS), and the ADHD self-rating scale (ADHD-SRS). Safety and tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.The least squares mean (95% CI) treatment difference (SHP465 MAS-placebo) for PERMP total score significantly favored SHP465 MAS over placebo when averaged across all postdose assessments (19.29 [10.95, 27.63]; P < 0.0001), with significant treatment differences favoring SHP465 MAS over placebo observed at 4-16 hours postdose (all P < 0.01). TEAEs observed with SHP465 MAS (≥5% of participants) included insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, headache, and anorexia. Mean pulse and blood pressure increases with SHP465 MAS exceeded those of placebo.SHP465 MAS (25 mg) was superior to placebo on PERMP total score, with treatment differences observed from 4 to 16 hours postdose; nominal treatment differences on the ADHD-SRS, but not the Co-ADHD-RS TSRS, were also observed. The safety and tolerability profile of SHP465 MAS was similar to previous reports for SHP465 MAS and other long-acting stimulants.

Participants were 581 adolescents (baseline age: M = 16.1, SD = 0.7; 58% female; 65% non-Hispanic White) from U.S. public high schools. Self-report questionnaires were administered during school at 3 annual assessment waves. Latent growth curve modeling examined the association between baseline BID and growth factors of anxiety disorder symptom trajectories. Covariates included baseline gender, age, race/ethnicity, parental education attainment, body mass index standard scores, and depressive symptoms. Higher BID at baseline was significantly associated with higher initial symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and significant school avoidance (SSA; ps = .001-.04) but was unrelated to initial separation anxiety disorder (SEP) symptoms (p = .27). Higher baseline BID also was associated with attenuated decreases in SAD symptoms across time (p = .001). Among adolescents with low baseline anxiety symptoms only, higher BID was associated with more attenuated decreases in SAD symptoms (p = .01) and greater increases in PD symptoms (p = .02). BID was unrelated to changes in GAD, SEP, and SSA symptoms (ps = .11-.94). Findings suggest that BID is associated with concurrent symptoms of multiple anxiety disorders and may have a prospective link to SAD and PD symptoms during adolescence. As such, assessing body image issues may be important to assess when identifying adolescents at risk for exacerbated SAD and PD symptoms.",

    "articleAbstract": "The current study examined whether trauma characteristics such as the type and number of traumatic events were associated with three suicidal behaviours (i.e. ideation, plan and attempt) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, post-traumatic symptoms and history of psychiatric disorders.Data came from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing ( N = 8841). Respondents were asked about exposure to 28 traumatic events that occurred during their lifetime. Suicidal behaviours were measured using three statements about whether the person ever seriously thought about or planned or attempted suicide.Sexual violence and exposure to multiple traumatic events were particularly associated with suicidal behaviours. The presence of the emotional numbing symptom cluster and co-occurrence of three psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder and substance use disorder) also increased the odds of suicidal behaviours. Analysis of age of onset revealed that the mean age of traumatic exposure was earlier than the age at which suicidal behaviours emerged.The current study is the first to demonstrate that sexual violence and exposure to multiple traumatic events are associated with suicidal behaviours in a representative sample of Australian adults. The results underline the potential benefits of thorough assessment of trauma history, post-traumatic symptoms and history of psychiatric disorders and their additive contribution in suicide risk among trauma victims. These findings can be used by clinicians and researchers for early intervention programmes.",

    "articleAbstract": "As there is growing evidence outlining varying degrees of social, economic and cultural changes among minority groups in China, there was a need to undertake research to determine whether modernization and urbanization of China has had an impact on the mental health of individuals from minority groups. In 1979, the Jino ethnic minority group was the last minority group to be designated a minority by the Chinese Central Government. As a direct result of the Chinese Government intervention, the Jino society began transitioning from a traditional rural lifestyle existence to that of a more modern urban lifestyle. Our objective was to explore whether changing social and economic influences had impacted the mental health of the Jino people.A longitudinal study over three decades was undertaken to determine the mental health of the Jino People.From our initial study in 1979 and subsequent follow-up studies in 1989, 1999 and 2009, there were no significant changes found for 1-month prevalence, lifetime prevalence and prognosis for schizophrenia and mental retardation among the Jino population researched. For major depressive disorders, there were significant differences, suggesting a rising trend not only in 1-month prevalence but also in lifetime prevalence. We found significant differences had occurred over the three decades for alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence and Korsakov's psychosis. At the same time, the annual suicide incidence had increased at least three times in 2009 compared to that of 1989.Results from our three-decade longitudinal repeated cross-sectional survey show that due to rapid social, economic and cultural changes among the Jino people, serious social and mental health problems such as alcohol-related disorder, suicide and major depressive disorders have increased.",

    "articleAbstract": "Androgenetic alopecia, a major cause for baldness, is caused by the deposition of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at the androgen receptors present in the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). Finasteride (FIN) is a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor capable of preventing the conversion of testosterone to DHT. But, its oral administration in males causes infertility. An attempt was made to prepare ethosomes of FIN with a size range 100-300 nm to enhance its delivery to the PSU. Finasteride loaded ethosomes (FES) were prepared using an ultra-probe sonicator and characterized for its size, morphology, surface charge and entrapment efficiency. The ability of FES to permeate across rat skin and frontal scalp skin of human cadaver was also evaluated. The spherical shaped ethosomes of different batches were in the size range of 107.8 ± 2.50 to 220.4 ± 6.92 nm and showed good permeation across rat skin and frontal scalp skin of human cadaver when compared to the unencapsulated FIN. The results portrayed the ability of FES to permeate across the stratum corneum to reach the PSU of the hair follicle. Although additional use of permeation enhancer increases the permeation of FIN across the skin, its addition may not be a favourable option for the deposition of ethosomes in the PSU.",

The focus of this study was to use item response theory to develop a 60-item, IPIP-based measure of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) that provides equal representation of the FFM facets and to test the reliability and convergent and criterion validity of this measure compared to the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). In an undergraduate sample (n = 359), scores from the NEO-FFI and IPIP-NEO-60 demonstrated good reliability and convergent validity with the NEO PI-R and IPIP-NEO-300. Additionally, across criterion variables in the undergraduate sample as well as a community-based sample (n = 757), the NEO-FFI and IPIP-NEO-60 demonstrated similar nomological networks across a wide range of external variables (rICC = .96). Finally, as expected, in an MTurk sample the IPIP-NEO-60 demonstrated advantages over the Big Five Inventory-2 (Soto & John, 2017 ; n = 342) with regard to the Agreeableness domain content. The results suggest strong reliability and validity of the IPIP-NEO-60 scores.",

The pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by random effects model.A total of eight studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled RRs of CRC, colon and rectal cancer for the highest versus lowest DII categories were 1.43 (95% CI 1.25-1.63), 1.37 (95% CI 1.16-1.62) and 1.44 (95% CI 1.23-1.69), respectively. A significant positive association was observed both in cohort studies (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.38) and case-control studies (RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.48-2.22). Nonlinear associations between DII scores and the risk of CRC, colon and rectal cancer were found in the dose-response analyses, the results showed that the risks of CRC, colon and rectal cancer increased slowly when the DII score was above 1.30, 2.21, and 1.30, respectively.Higher DII scores might increase CRC risk. Thus, people should adopt more anti-inflammatory diets such as those high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, herbs, and spices.",

In total, 70 speech pathology students and 76 occupational therapy students participated in a role-play involving DVD footage and documentation to facilitate assessment planning and analysis of assessment data for a child with autism. Questionnaires asked participants to rate their perceived experiences across 13 items using a 5-point Likert scale, as well as three open-ended questions. The results revealed positive reactions to the role-play and suggested that students felt that the learning objectives had been met. Many students expressed interest in engaging in further interprofessional learning experiences. Taken in conjunction with other similar studies, interprofessional simulation-based workshops using DVD footage may provide a manageable alternative to traditional interprofessional learning modalities, in particular when incorporating clients with complex and developmental disabilities.",

The optimized NLCs were evaluated for various physical and morphological characterizations. The in vitro studies for drug release showed that PQ loaded NLCs had a sustained release up to 72 h and the stability studies confirmed that the PQ-NLCs were stable for 90 d at 4 °C and 25 °C. In vitro erythrocyte toxicity revealed that PQ-NLCs were less toxic than the pure drug. In vitro parasite growth inhibition assay showed an IC50 value of 71.11 ± 6.47 ng/ml for the 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum (CQ sensitive) strain and 263.86 ± 5.68 ng/ml for RKL9 P. falciparum (CQ resistant) strain for the PQ-NLCs. Enhanced parasitaemia suppression of 99.46% at 2 mg/kg/d, a better suppression of parasitaemia of about 28% more than pure drug and a higher survivality rate of 66.66% even after the 35th day was observed for the PQ loaded NLCs. Also from the comparative fluorescent imaging study, it was clearly observed that accumulation of PQ-NLCs in the liver was more that of the pure drug. These results clearly indicated that the limitations of antimalarial drug PQ can be overcomed by loading it into the NLCs.",

    "articleAbstract": "It is generally assumed that the latent trait is normally distributed in the population when estimating logistic item response theory (IRT) model parameters. This assumption requires that the latent trait be fully continuous and the population homogenous (i.e., not a mixture). When this normality assumption is violated, models are misspecified, and item and person parameter estimates are inaccurate. When normality cannot be assumed, it might be appropriate to consider alternative modeling approaches: (a) a zero-inflated mixture, (b) a log-logistic, (c) a Ramsay curve, or (d) a heteroskedastic-skew model. The first 2 models were developed to address modeling problems associated with so-called quasi-continuous or unipolar constructs, which apply only to a subset of the population, or are meaningful at one end of the continuum only. The second 2 models were developed to address non-normal latent trait distributions and violations of homogeneity of error variance, respectively. To introduce these alternative IRT models and illustrate their strengths and weaknesses, we performed real data application comparing results to those from a graded response model. We review both statistical and theoretical challenges in applying these models and choosing among them. Future applications of these and other alternative models (e.g., unfolding, diffusion) are needed to advance understanding about model choice in particular situations.",

    "articleAbstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease may show certain cognitive impairments, although it is unclear how these deficits can affect their learning potential. The study aims to use the testing-the-limits technique to compare the potential for cognitive plasticity in a group of Patients with Parkinson's disease (N = 33) and a group of healthy older adults (N = 33). Sixty-six participants performed verbal learning test to analyze the learning potential. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant main effects of time, group, and the interaction. There is a lower learning potential in subjects with Parkinson's disease; however, those still maintain a certain capacity for learning and, therefore, for cognitive plasticity.",

    "articleAbstract": "This article begins by reviewing the proficiency of personality assessment in the context of the competencies movement, which has dominated health service psychology in recent years. It examines the value of including a capability framework for advancing this proficiency and enhancing the quality of personality assessments, including Therapeutic Assessment (Finn & Tonsager, 1997 ), that include a personality assessment component. This hybrid competency-capability framework is used to set the stage for the conduct of personality assessments in a variety of contexts and for the optimal training of personality assessment. Future directions are offered in terms of ways psychologists can strengthen their social contract with the public and offer a broader array of personality assessments in more diverse contexts and by individuals who are both competent and capable.",

    "articleAbstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a complex gram-negative facultative anaerobe replete with a variety of arsenals to activate, modify and destroy host defense mechanisms. The microbe is a common cause of nosocomial infections and an antibiotic-resistant priority pathogen. In the lung, P. aeruginosa disrupts upper and lower airway homeostasis by damaging the epithelium and evading innate and adaptive immune responses. The biology of these interactions is essential to understand P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. P. aeruginosa interacts directly with host cells via flagella, pili, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, and the type III secretion system localized in the outer membrane. P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecules regulate the release of soluble factors that enhance the spread of infection. These characteristics of P. aeruginosa differentially affect lung epithelial, innate, and adaptive immune cells involved in the production of mediators and the recruitment of additional immune cell subsets. Pathogen interactions with individual host cells and in the context of host acute lung infection are discussed to reveal pathways that may be targeted therapeutically.",

Such photoswitching from strongly-coupled to weakly-coupled spin state (SS->WS) was recently found to be ultrafast, thus enhancing the interest in these systems and the scope of their potential applications. However, up to date such SS->WS photoswitching was demonstrated only at cryogenic temperatures, being limited by the absence of suitable SS states and short relaxation times at T>100 K. In this work we selected model compound Cu(hfac)2Liso-Pr residing in the mixed SS/WS state at room temperature and investigated it using femtosecond optical spectroscopy. Photoinduced spin dynamics was detected, and an ultrafast SS->WS photoswitching was for the first time demonstrated at room temperature, constituting an important milestone in the development of copper(II)-nitroxide molecular magnets for practical purposes.",

However, synthesis of URIs is non-trivial. Thus, a structurally similar alternative is desirable. i-indigo has a π core and lactam rings that is structurally similar to the RIs. Unsymmetrical i-indigo can be easily synthesized by condensing oxindole and isatin. We have synthesized a series of unsymmetrical i-inidgo molecules. In these molecules π-π interaction, hydrogen bonding, and vanderwaal interactions are in operation. Due to these, the molecules self-assemble into spheres, fibers, and dahlia flower morphologies. If the hydrogen bonding interaction is disrupted, all of them form fibers. Control experiments indicate that the complete absence of hydrogen bonding is deleterious to self-assembly. We also show that the lower analogs of i-indigo are not suffice to form self-assembled nanostructures.",

    "articleAbstract": "Protein-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) are promising tools for a variety of biomedical applications, from immunoassays and biosensors to theranostics and drug-delivery. In such applications, conjugation of affinity proteins (e.g., antibodies) to the nanoparticle surface many times compromises biological activity and specificity, leading to increased reagent consumption and decreased assay performance. To address this problem, we engineered a biomolecular magnetic separation system that eliminates the need to chemically modify the capture biomolecules with nanoparticles or synthetic polymers of any kind. The system consists of (i) thermo-responsive magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles displaying poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm), and (ii) an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fused with the affinity protein Cohesin (Coh). Proper design of pNIPAm-mNPs and ELP-Coh allowed for efficient cross-aggregation of the two distinct nanoparticle types under collapsing stimuli, which enabled magnetic separation of ELP-Coh aggregates bound to target Dockerin (Doc) molecules. Selective re-solubilization of the ELP-Coh:Doc complexes was achieved under intermediate conditions under which only the pNIPAm-mNPs remained aggregated. We show that ELP-Coh is capable of magnetically separating and purifying nanomolar quantities of Doc as well as eukaryotic whole cells displaying the complementary Doc domain from diluted human plasma. This modular system provides magnetic enrichment and purification of captured molecular targets, and eliminates the requirement of bio-functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles to achieve bioseparations. Our streamlined and simplified approach is amenable for point-of-use applications and brings the advantages of ELP-fusion proteins to the realm of magnetic particle separation systems.",

    "articleAbstract": "Four new manganese germanates and silicates, A2MnGeO4 (A = Li, Na) and A2MnSiO4 (A = Na, Ag), were prepared, and their crystal structures were determined using the X-ray Rietveld method. All of them contain all components in tetrahedral coordination. Li2MnGeO4 is orthorhombic (Pmn21) layered, isostructural with Li2CdGeO4, and the three other compounds are monoclinic (Pn) cristobalite-related frameworks. As in other stuffed cristobalites of various symmetry (Pn A2MXO4, Pna21 and Pbca AMO2), average bond angles on bridging oxygens (here, Mn-O-X) increase with increasing A/X and/or A/M radius ratios, indicating the trend to the ideal cubic (Fd3̅m) structure typified by CsAlO2. The sublattices of the magnetic Mn(2+) ions in both structure types under study (Pmn21 and Pn) are essentially the same; namely, they are pseudocubic eutaxy with 12 nearest neighbors. The magnetic properties of the four new phases plus Li2MnSiO4 were characterized by carrying out magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, magnetization, and electron spin resonance measurements and also by performing energy-mapping analysis to evaluate their spin exchange constants. Ag2MnSiO4 remains paramagnetic down to 2 K, but A2MnXO4 (A = Li, Na; X = Si, Ge) undergo a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic ordering. All five phases exhibit short-range AFM ordering correlations, hence showing them to be low-dimensional magnets and a magnetic field induced spin-reorientation transition at T < TN for all AFM phases. We constructed the magnetic phase diagrams for A2MnXO4 (A = Li, Na; X = Si, Ge) on the basis of the thermodynamic data in magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetic properties of all five phases experimentally determined are well explained by their spin exchange constants evaluated by performing energy-mapping analysis.",

A bonding analysis is provided, which shows strong iono-covalent bonding between the iodide and its host. The electronic structures of the title compounds suggest the possibility for interesting photoluminescent properties, which were fully investigated by time-dependent DFT calculations including vibronic contributions to simulate the phosphorescence spectra. The quantum mechanical results were compared to the experimental data obtained for the new clusters [Cu11(μ9-I)(μ3-I)3{Se2P(O(i)Pr)2}6](+) and [Cu11(μ9-I)(μ3-I)3(Se2PPh2)6](+), whose syntheses, X-ray structures, and full characterizations are reported in this paper. From this combined theoretical/experimental investigation, it is suggested that the encapsulation by the same copper(I) cages of a formally Cu(-) anion is also possible. DFT calculations on these species are consistent with the existence of stable two-electron superatoms.",

The unique oxophilicity of tin(IV) porphyrin was the driving force for the formation of these tetrads. Moreover, these novel tetrads represent the first examples of cyclic porphyrins containing tin(IV) that are constructed exclusively on the basis of the \"Sn-O\" interaction without any other complementary, noncompetitive mode of interactions. The molecular structures of the cyclic tetrads have been investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, quantum-mechanical calculations, and, in one case, single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The X-ray structure revealed that the two cis-dihydroxy-N2S2 porphyrins were coordinated at the axial positions of two tin(IV) porphyrins, leading to the symmetric cyclic tetrad structure. The optical properties of tetrads were studied, and these compounds were stable under redox conditions. Preliminary photophysical studies carried out on the tetrads indicated efficient energy transfer from tin(IV) porphyrin to the thiaporphyrin unit, which highlights their potential applications in energy and electron transfer in the future.",

Thioredoxin, a disulfide-reducing protein, is released into the wort from some yeast strains during fermentation. The capacity of the thioredoxin enzyme system (thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, NADPH) to reduce oxidized thiols in boiled wort under fermentation-like conditions were studied. Free thiols were quantitated in boiled wort samples by derivatization with ThioGlo®1 and fluorescence detection of thiol-derivatives. When boiled wort was incubated with all components of the thioredoxin system at pH 7.0 and 25 C for 60 min under anaerobic conditions, the free thiol concentration increased from 25 to 224 µM. At pH values similar to wort (pH 5.7) and beer (pH 4.5), the thioredoxin system was also capable of increasing the free thiol concentration, although with lower efficiency to 187 and 170 µM, respectively. The presence of sulfite, an important antioxidant in beer secreted by the yeast during fermentation, was found to inactivate thioredoxin by sulfitolysis. Reduction of oxidized thiols by the thioredoxin system was therefore only found to be efficient in the absence of sulfite.",

    "articleAbstract": "In human, primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) processing starts from precise cleavage of the stem loop, which is catalyzed by Drosha-DGCR8 complex. However, the significant inconsistencies in the expression levels among primary, precursor and mature miRNAs clearly indicate that many other factors may be involved in this regulation. Here, we utilize a newly-developed RNA affinity technique to isolate such factors. In this study, a tRNA-scaffolded aptamer (tRSA)-based RNA affinity tag, by directly fusing primary let-7 miRNA to the 3'-end of tRSA, is employed to pull down the protein components specifically binding to pri-let-7. We show that La protein binds to pri-let-7 via its La motif and significantly promotes the processing efficiency of pri-let-7 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that La protein is associated with DGCR8, but not Drosha, in an RNA-dependent manner. Interestingly, the RNA binding capacity of La motif is indispensable for miRNA processing. Hence, we propose that La protein is an important microprocessor component regulating miRNA processing efficiency by association with DGCR8 to regulate DGCR8-Drosha complex formation for miRNA processing.",

    "articleAbstract": "3,7-Dihydroxy-4-oxo-2-phenyl-4Hchromene-8-carbaldehyde in methylcyclohexane solvent was chosen to investigate excited-state proton transfer mechanisms by using a time-dependent density-functional theory method. The results show that the single- and double-proton-transfer mechanisms are related and exist simultaneously in the excited states, which differs from those reported in previous experiments (Serdiuk et al., RSC. Adv. 2015, 5, 102191-102203). The analyses of bond distance, bond angle, the molecular electrostatic potential surface and the infrared vibrational spectra show that two intramolecular hydrogen bonds were formed in the S0 state, and upon excitation, the two intramolecular hydrogen bonds were strengthened in the S1 state, which can facilitate the proton-transfer process. The calculated absorption and fluorescence spectra agree well with the experimental results. The constructed potential-energy surfaces on the S1 and S0 states can explain the proton-transfer process. In the S1 state, three types of proton-transfer processes exist as type 1 (single-proton transfer: H2 from O1 to O3), type 2 (single-proton transfer: H5 from O4 to O6) and type 3 (double-proton transfer). The relationship of the potential barrier is: type 1 (1.02 kcal/mol) < type 2 (1.57 kcal/mol) < type 3 (2.29 kcal/mol), which indicates that type 1 is most susceptible to proton transfer.",

    "articleAbstract": "Rapid and real-time detection of heavy metals in water with a portable microsystem is a growing demand in the field of environmental monitoring, food safety, and future cyber-physical infrastructure. Here, we report a novel ultrasensitive pulse-driven capacitance-based lead ion sensor using self-assembled graphene oxide (GO) monolayer deposition strategy to recognize the heavy metal ions in water. The overall field-effect transistor (FET) structure consists of a thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel with a thin layer of Al2O3 passivation as a top gate combined with sputtered gold nanoparticles that link with the glutathione (GSH) probe to attract Pb(2+) ions in water. Using a preprogrammed microcontroller, chemo-capacitance based detection of lead ions has been demonstrated with this FET sensor. With a rapid response (∼1-2 s) and negligible signal drift, a limit of detection (LOD) < 1 ppb and excellent selectivity (with a sensitivity to lead ions 1 order of magnitude higher than that of interfering ions) can be achieved for Pb(2+) measurements. The overall assay time (∼10 s) for background water stabilization followed by lead ion testing and calculation is much shorter than common FET resistance/current measurements (∼minutes) and other conventional methods, such as optical and inductively coupled plasma methods (∼hours). An approximate linear operational range (5-20 ppb) around 15 ppb (the maximum contaminant limit by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for lead in drinking water) makes it especially suitable for drinking water quality monitoring. The validity of the pulse method is confirmed by quantifying Pb(2+) in various real water samples such as tap, lake, and river water with an accuracy ∼75%. This capacitance measurement strategy is promising and can be readily extended to various FET-based sensor devices for other targets.",

    "articleAbstract": "In Bacillus subtilis, the 60-subunit dodecahedral capsid formed by lumazine synthase (BsLS) acts as a container for trimeric riboflavin synthase (BsRS). To test whether the C-terminal sequence of BsRS is responsible for its encapsulation by BsLS, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to either the last 11 or last 32 amino acids of BsRS, offering variants GFP11 and GFP32, respectively. After purification, BsLS capsids that had been co-produced in bacteria with GFP11 or GFP32 are 15-fold and 6-fold more fluorescent, respectively, than BsLS co-produced with GFP lacking any BsRS fragment, indicating complex formation. ELISA experiments confirm that GFP11 is localized within the BsLS capsid. In addition, fusing the last 11 amino acids of BsRS to the C-terminus of the Abrin A chain also led to its encapsulation by BsLS at a level similar to that of GFP11. Together, these results demonstrate that the C-terminal tail of BsRS can act as an encapsulation tag capable of targeting other proteins to the BsLS capsid interior. As with the natural BsLS+BsRS complex, mild changes in pH and buffer identity trigger dissociation of the GFP11 guest, accompanied by a substantial expansion of the BsLS capsid. This system for protein encapsulation and release provides a novel tool for bionanotechnology.",

The key step of this approach is an epimerization of C5 by an elimination-addition sequence leading to L-ido disaccharide (GH unit) with a total yield of 24% (36% for the EF fragment). 1,6-Anhydro ring opening gave suitable substrates for efficient synthesis of fully protected Idraparinux.

In this work, Raman spectroscopy, factor group analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) were applied to investigate the structural and spectral details of the H-Li2Mo4O13 crystal and a Li2Mo4O13 melt. Factor group analysis shows that the crystal has 171 vibrational modes (84Ag + 87Au), including three acoustic modes (3Au), six librational modes (2Ag + 4Au), 21 translational modes (7Ag + 14Au), and 141 internal modes (75Ag + 66Au). All of the Ag modes are Raman-active and were assigned by the DFT method. The Li2Mo4O13 melt structure was deduced from the H-Li2Mo4O13 crystal structure and demonstrated by the DFT method. The results show that the Li2Mo4O13 melt is made up of Li(+) ions and Mo4O13(2-) groups, each of which is formed by four corner-sharing MoO3Ø/MoO2Ø2 tetrahedra (Ø = bridging oxygen). The melt has three acoustic modes (3A) and 54 optical modes (54A). All of the optical modes are Raman-active and were accurately assigned by the DFT method.",

For this reason, we compared five strategies to identify stabilizing mutations in a model α/β-hydrolase-fold enzyme, salicylic acid binding protein 2, SABP2, to reversible denaturation by urea and to irreversible denaturation by heat. The five strategies included and one location-agnostic approach (random mutagenesis using error-prone PCR), two structure-based approaches (computational design (Rosetta, FoldX) and mutation of flexible regions) and two sequence-based approaches (addition of proline at locations where a more stable homolog has proline and mutation to consensus). All strategies identified stabilizing mutations, but the best balance of success rate, degree of stabilization, and ease of implementation was mutation to consensus. A web-based automated program that predicts substitutions needed to mutate to consensus is available at http://kazlab.umn.edu.",

The acid-base behavior and Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) mixed coordination have been analyzed by potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The resolution of the crystal structures of [Cu2L2Cl2](ClO4)2·1.67H2O (1), [Cu2HL2Br2](ClO4)3·1.5H2O (2), and [CuZnL2Cl2](ClO4)2·1.64H2O (3) shows, in agreement with the solution data, the formation of homobinuclear Cu(2+)/Cu(2+) and heterobinuclear Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) complexes. The metal ions are coordinated within the two macrocyclic cavities of the ligand with the involvement of a secondary amino group of the bridge in the case of 1 and 3. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms the 1:1 Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) stoichiometry of 3. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities of the Cu(2+)/Cu(2+) and Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) complexes of L1 and L2 have been evaluated using nitro blue tetrazolium assays at pH 7.4. The IC50 and kcat values obtained for the [Cu2L1](4+) complex rank among the best values reported in the literature for Cu-SOD mimics. Interestingly, the binuclear Cu(2+) complexes of L1 and L2 have low toxicity in cultures of mammalian cell lines and show significant antioxidant activity in a copper-dependent SOD (SOD1)-defective yeast model. The results are rationalized by taking into account the binding modes of the Cu(2+) ions in the different complexes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Multimodal imaging guided synergistic therapy promises more accurate diagnosis and higher therapeutic efficiency than single imaging modality or their simple \"mechanical\" combination. In this research, we fabricated a new multifunctional drug delivery system based on hollow gold nanoshells capped by gadolinium (Gd) based bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids (Au@BSA-Gd). The obtained nanoparticles exhibited excellent photothermal effect and computed tomography (CT)/photoacoustic (PA) activity. Besides, the BSA-bioinspired gadolinium complex endowed the nanoparticles attractive T1 contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, the NIR absorbing phototherapeutic agent (ICG) was loaded into the Au@BSA-Gd nanoparticles due to their unique hollow and porous structures, thus performing photodynamic/photothermal property and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/PA imaging capability. In this manner, a combined therapy approach was established consisting of photothermal therapy based on Au@BSA-Gd and photodynamic/photothermal therapy based on ICG. Furthermore, the well-designed nanocomposites with multiple integrated modalities enabled them to be an ideal nanotheranostic agent for NIRF/PA/CT/MR quadmodal imaging. Therefore, the ICG loaded albumin-bioinspired gadolinium hybrids functionalized hollow gold nanoshells (ICG-Au@BSA-Gd) hold great promise as a theranostic platform for simultaneously therapeutic monitoring and precise cancer therapy.",

    "articleAbstract": "Successful use of microgels as delivery systems of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) requires control of factors determining peptide loading and release to/from the microgels, as well as of membrane interactions of both microgel particles and released peptides. In order to elucidate these, we here investigate effects of microgel charge density and conformationally induced peptide amphiphilicity on AMP loading and release, using detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural studies combined with a battery of other physicochemical methods. In parallel, consequences of peptide loading and release for membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects were investigated. In doing so, poly(ethyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) microgels were found to incorporate the cationic AMPs EFK17a (EFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLV) and its partially D-amino acid-substituted variant EFK17da (E(dF)KR(dI)VQR(dI)KD(dF)LRNLV), to an extent increasing with microgel charge density and peptide amphiphilicity. After microgel incorporation, which occurred preferentially in the microgel core, EFK17a forms a helix with pronounced amphiphilicity, while EFK17da displays a folded conformation, stabilized by a hydrophobic hub consisting of aromatic/aromatic and aliphatic/aromatic interactions, resulting in much lower amphiphilicity. Under wide ranges of peptide loading, the microgels displayed net negative z-potential. Such negatively charged microgels do not bind to, nor lyse, bacteria-mimicking membranes. Instead, membrane disruption in these systems is mediated almost exclusively by peptide release, which in turn is promoted at higher ionic strength and lower peptide amphiphilicity. Analogously, antimicrobial effects against Escherichia coli were found to be dictated by peptide release. Taken together, the findings show that peptide loading, packing, and release strongly affect the performance of microgels as AMP delivery systems, effects that can be tuned by (conformationally induced) peptide amphiphilicity, and by microgel charge density.",

    "articleAbstract": "Amine-containing sorbents have been extensively studied for post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture due to their ability to chemisorb CO2 from the flue gas. However, most sorbents are in the form of powders currently, which is not the ideal configuration for the flue gas separation because of the fragile nature and poor mechanical properties, resulting in blocking of the flow pipes and difficult recycling. Herein, we present a novel approach for the facile fabrication of flexible, robust and polyethyleneimine (PEI)-grafted hydrolyzed porous PAN nanofibrous membranes (HPPAN-PEI NFM) through the combination of electrospinning, pore-forming process, hydrolysis reaction and the subsequent grafting technique. Excitedly, we find that all the resultant porous PAN (PPAN) fibers exhibit a balsam pear skin-like porous structure due to the selective removal of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) from PAN/PVP fibers by water extraction. Significantly, HPPAN-PEI NFM retain their mesoporosity, as well as exhibit good thermal stability and prominent tensile strength (11.1 MPa) after grafting, guaranteeing their application in CO2 trapping from the flue gas. When expose to CO2 at 40 °C, the HPPAN-PEI NFM show an enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.23 mmol g-1 (based on the overall quantity of the sample) or 6.15 mmol g-1 (based on the quantity of grafted PEI). Moreover, the developed HPPAN-PEI NFM display significantly selective capture for CO2 over N2 and excellent recyclability. The CO2 capacity retain 92% of the initial capacity after 20 adsorption/desorption cycle tests, indicating that the resultant HPPAN-PEI NFM have good long-term stability. This work paves the way for fabricating NFM-based solid adsorption materials endowed porous structure applied to efficient post-combustion CO2 capture.",

    "articleAbstract": "Oxygen-states (O-states) of carbon quantum dots (CDs) play an important role on their optical properties and analytical applications. However, the rapid screening of O-states in CDs is still a great challenge because of the complicated surface composition. In this study, it is found that chemiluminescence (CL) intensity of prepared CDs in the presence of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) is proportional to the content of C-O group-related O-states. The related mechanism discloses that the O-state dependent CL is assigned to the reason that abundant C-O functional groups in CDs with high O-states could facilitate the electron transfer of the produced smaller energy gaps for strong CL emission. Hence, ONOO--induced CL can be utilized as a facile probe for the rapid screening of O-states in CDs with some advantages, such as rapid response, low cost and easy operation. Its practicability is verified by detecting the CL of phosphorus-doped CDs with variable phosphorus doping contents. The content of C-O group-related O-states in sulfur/phosphorus-doped CDs measured by the proposed CL probe is consistent with by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. This strategy can also be extended to distinguish O-states in different types of nanoparticles via tuning the CL probe molecules.",

    "articleAbstract": "Li3V2-xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.05) cathode materials, which allow extraction of 3 mol of Li from the formula unit, were investigated to achieve a high energy density utilizing multi-electron reactions, activated by the V3+/5+ redox reaction. Structural investigation demonstrates that V3+ was replaced by equivalent Mn3+, as confirmed by Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction data and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy. The substitution simultaneously lowered the band gap energy from 3.4 eV to 3.2 eV, according to a density functional theory calculation. In addition to the effect of Mn doping, surface carbonization of Li3V2-xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.05) dramatically increased the electric conductivity up to 10-3 S cm-1. As a result, the carbon-coated Li3V2-xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0.05) delivered a high discharge (reduction) capacity of approximately 180 mAh g-1 at a current of 20 mA g-1 (0.1 C-rate) with excellent retention, delivering approximately 163 mAh g-1 at the 200th cycle. Even at 50C (10 A g-1), the electrode could afford a discharge capacity of 68 mAh g-1 and could deliver approximately 104 mAh g-1 (1C) at -10 °C with the help of Mn doping and carbon coating. The synergetic effects, such as a lowered band gap energy by Mn doping and high electric conductivity associated with carbon coating, are responsible for the superior electrode performances, including thermal properties with extremely low exothermic heat generation (< 0.4 J g-1 for Li0.02V1.95Mn0.05(PO4)3), which is compatible with the layered high energy density of LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 materials.",

    "articleAbstract": "In the Earth's atmosphere, numerous gas-phase species and airborne particles form a complex mixture called atmospheric aerosol. A variety of natural and anthropogenic primary emission sources along with chemical and photochemical transformations of the emitted compounds in the atmosphere contribute to a large diversity of aerosols, which often contain hundreds of individual components existing in different phases in a dynamic gas-particle exchange.1-3 Common examples of atmospheric aerosols include sea-salt spray (SSA), biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), mineral dust, soot, biological aerosol, and forest haze. Organic aerosol (OA) is commonly categorized either as a primary organic aerosol (POA) or secondary organic aerosol (SOA) depending on how it is produced. However, this distinction is quickly erased by the chemical and physical aging processes in the atmosphere. In the aerosol system, concentrations of individual compounds both in the gas- and condensed phases can differ by orders of magnitude. Chemical properties of these species also are remarkably diverse with respect to their molecular weights, structures, volatility, polarity, light absorption, and reactivity.4-9 Furthermore, particles in aerosol mixtures have a distribution of sizes and typically contain several components (internal mixing); mixtures of individual single-component particles (external mixing) are also common. Because of their profound impact on air quality in urban areas, biogeochemical cycling of elements, plant ecology, climate, and human health, atmospheric aerosols have been actively investigated by the scientific community. Assessment and mitigation of aerosols' impact on the environment require detailed experimental speciation of their chemical composition and physical properties - a challenging task that drives the development and applications of novel mass spectrometry (MS) based analytical techniques for aerosol measurements. In this review, we summarize the most recent developments in MS instrumentation and their applications focused on understanding the formation and transformation of OA, one of the most complex and dynamic atmospheric components, with an emphasis on studies published between 2015 and 2017. The review is by no means comprehensive but rather emphasizes the breadth of analytical developments in both online and off-line analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and condensed-phase aerosol components.",

    "articleAbstract": "Many bacteria encode biosynthetic proteins that produce a vast array of natural products. These compounds are often synthesized during host invasion as they function as virulence factors. In addition, such secondary metabolites have yielded numerous molecular scaffolds with pharmaceutical and clinical importance. The gene clusters that encode proteins responsible for synthesis of these compounds are typically silenced or \"cryptic\" under laboratory growth conditions, hampering discovery of novel lead compounds. We report here that MftR is a global repressor of secondary metabolite synthesis in Burkholderia thailandensis and that urate functions as a physiologically relevant inducer of gene expression. Biosynthetic gene clusters under MftR control include those associated with production of the antimicrobial bactobolins, the iron siderophore malleobactin, and the virulence factor malleilactone. MftR also controls additional genes associated with survival in a host environment, such as genes encoding components of the type III secretion system (T3SS) and proteins linked to anaerobic respiration. This observation not only has implications for understanding activation of gene regulatory networks during host invasion, but it also paves the way for isolation of novel therapeutic leads.",

    "articleAbstract": "Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs)@UiO-66-NH2 composites were synthesized and encompassed the benefits of permanent porosity, high thermal and chemical stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), together with the functional behavior of isolated Pt NPs. The PVP-stabilized Pt NPs with the average diameter of 2.48 nm were well dispersed and confined within the framework of UiO-66-NH2. Pt NPs possess highly peroxidase-like activities, and make the composites oxidize 3, 3´, 5, 5´-tetramethylbenzidine in presence of H2O2. Moreover, the specific interaction between Hg2+ and Pt NPs leads to the effective suppression of the peroxidase-like activity of Pt NPs@UiO-66-NH2, which endows excellent selectivity for Hg2+ measurement over the interfering metal ions. Based on the colorimetric sensing system, Hg2+ is linearly measured over the range from 0 to 10 nM with a detection limit of 0.35 nM. Moreover, the as-obtained Pt NPs@UiO-66-NH2 nanocomposites exhibit high capacity and good selectivity for Hg2+ adsorption, which is successfully applied to treat Hg2+ in water with removal efficiency over 99%. With these findings, Pt NPs@UiO-66-NH2 composites can be used to develop a simple and rapid colorimetric sensing system, and utilized as nanoadsorbents for facile removal of Hg2+. This work not only expands the scientific researches on MOFs but also provides practical application in environmental, biological and relative fields.",

    "articleAbstract": "Since fabricating geometrically well-defined, noninvasive, and compliant electrical contacts over molecular monolayers is difficult, creating molecular-scale electronic devices that function in high yield with good reproducibility is challenging. Moreover, none of the previously reported methods to form organic-electrode contacts at the nanometer and micrometer scales have resulted in directly addressable contacts in an untethered form under ambient conditions without the use of cumbersome equipment and nanolithography. Here we show that in situ encapsulation of a liquid metal (eutectic Ga-In alloy) microelectrode, which is used for junction formation, with a convenient photocurable polymeric scaffold enables untethering of the electrode and direct writing of arbitrary arrays of high-yielding molecular junctions under ambient conditions in a maskless fashion. The formed junctions function in quantitative yields and can afford tunneling currents with high reproducibility; they also function at low temperatures and under bent. The results reported here promise a massively parallel printing technology to construct integrated circuits based on molecular junctions with soft top contacts.",

    "articleAbstract": "Enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) predicts overall survival and treatment response in metastatic cancer, but as many commercialized assays isolate CTCs positive for epithelial cell markers alone, CTCs with little or no EpCAM expression stay undetected. Therefore, CTC enrichment and isolation by label-free methods based on biophysical rather than biochemical properties could provide a more representative spectrum of CTCs. Here, we report on a clinical scale automated acoustic microfluidic platform processing 5 mL erythrocyte depleted paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixed blood (diluted 1:2) at a flow rate of 75 µL/min, recovering 43/50 (87±2.3%) breast cancer cell line cells (MCF7), with 0.11% cancer cell purity and 162-fold enrichment in close to 2 hours based on intrinsic biophysical cell properties. Adjustments of the voltage-settings aimed at higher cancer cell purity in the central outlet provided 0.72% cancer cell purity and 1445-fold enrichment that resulted in 62±8.7% cancer cell recovery. Similar rates of cancer cell recovery, cancer-cell purity and fold-enrichment were seen with both prostate cancer (DU145, PC3) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell line cells. We identified eosinophil granulocytes as the predominant WBC contaminant (85%) in the enriched cancer cell fraction. Processing of viable cancer cells in erythrocyte depleted blood provided slightly reduced results as to fixed cells, (77% cancer cells in the enriched cancer cell fraction, with 0.2% WBC contamination). We demonstrate feasibility of enriching either PFA-fixed or viable cancer cells with a clinical scale acoustic microfluidic platform that can be adjusted to meet requirements for either high cancer cell recovery or higher purity, and can process 5 mL blood samples in close to 2 hours.",

    "articleAbstract": "We report fabrication of a fully integrated plastic based microfluidic biochip for biosensing application. The microfluidic channels were fabricated by tune transfer method and integrated with the pre-functionalized sensing platform. This approach to assemble microchannel into pre-functionalized sensing substrate facilitates controlled functionalization and prevents damages on functionalized surface. The sensing platform comprised of a three electrode system, in which the sensing electrode was integrated with antibody immobilized carbon nanotubes-zinc oxide (C-ZnO) nanofibers. Electrospinning technique was used to synthesize C-ZnO nanofibers and the surface of the nanofibers was covalently conjugated with histidine rich protein II antibodies (AntiHRP II) toward detection of infectious malarial specific antigen, namely histidine rich protein II (HRP II). The analytical performance of the fabricated biochip was evaluated by differential pulse voltammetry method. The device exhibited a high sensitivity of 1.19 mA/ g mL(-1) /cm(2) over a wide detection range (10 fg/mL - 100 µg/mL) with a low detection limit of 7.5 fg/mL towards HRP II detection. This fully integrated biochip offers a promising cost-effective approach for detection of several other infectious disease biomarkers.",

    "articleAbstract": "Limited ranges of motion (ROM) have been considered as a primary risk factor for some football injuries, but only a few studies have analysed differences in lower extremity joints. The main purposes were (a) to describe the lower extremity ROM profile in professional football players; and (b) to examine differences between goalkeepers and outfield players.82 professional male football players from 4 teams were measured in the 2013 pre-season. Measures of passive hip (flexion with knee flexed [PHFKF] and extended [PHFKE], extension [PHE], abduction [PHA], external [PHER] and internal [PHIR] rotation), knee (flexion [PKF]) and ankle (dorsiflexion with knee flexed [ADFKF] and extended [ADFKE]) ROMs were taken. Magnitude-based inferences exploring differences between player position and limb were made.46% of all participants showed restricted PHFKE and/or around 30% showed restricted ADFKF ROM values. Contrarily, most players reported normal PHFKF, PHE, PHIR and PHER as well as PKF ROM scores with percentage values close to 100%. Bilateral meaningful differences for PHA, PHIR and PHER were found in approximately 30% of outfield players and goalkeepers. Statistical analysis found trivial differences between players for PHFKE, PHE, PHIR, PHER, ADFKE and ADFKF. However, moderate differences between players were found for PHFKF, PHA and PKF, with goalkeepers demonstrating higher values than outfield players.The findings of this study reinforce the necessity of prescribing exercises aimed at improving PHFKE and ADFKF ROM within everyday football training routines. In addition, as some bilateral deficits were observed, unilateral training should be considered where appropriate.",

The ECT treatment efficacy depends on the drug concentration during the use, patient characteristics, the distribution of the electric field inside the tumour and the tumour characteristics.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ECT in a patient affected by relapsed lower lip squamous cell carcinoma, not candidate for traditional surgery but treated for persistent pain with swallowing and breathing difficulties.A 58-year-old caucasian man was referred with a relapsed lower lip squamous cell carcinoma. The patient showed a TNM staging system of T2N0M0. The patient was treated with ECT with midazolam, remifentanil and intravenous bleomycin therapy.The results of the treatment performed on the patient in the study showed good subjective tolerance. The patient had no postoperative bleeding or swelling of the treated area. The 2 years follow up showed no local or regional relapse, echography was negative.This study demonstrates that ECT is an effective therapeutic solution for relapsed lower lip squamous cell carcinoma. ECT treatment is a conservative surgery option with a reduced postoperative damage.",

Periodontal pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (FMBS) and dental plaque (FMPS) were measured at baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months. Microbiological samples were taken at baseline, at 4 weeks and 3 months after plaque recording and prior to PPD and BoP measurements.Forty subjects were randomized to treatment. Both therapies resulted in reduced FMPS, FMBS and residual pockets at 4 weeks and 3 months. The differences were not statistically significant. There were no treatment-related adverse events. Total bacterial count and the specific pathogens were reduced at 4 weeks and 3 months by both mouthwashes with no statistical differences between them at neither periods of time.0.147% LAE-containing mouthwash could be an alternative to the use of 0.12% CHX in the non surgical therapy of periodontitis considering the similar clinical effects, more stable microbiological improvement and absence of adverse effects.",

    "articleAbstract": "We investigated whether blockade of the CD47 signaling pathway could reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of renal allografts donated after cardiac death (DCD) in a porcine animal model of transplantation. Renal allografts were subjected to 30 min of warm ischemia, 3.5 hours of cold ischemia and then perfused with a humanized anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (CD47mAb) in the treatment group or HTK solution in the control group (n=4/group). The animals were euthanized 5 days after transplantation. At the time of reperfusion, indocyanine green-based in vivo imaging showed that CD47mAb-treated organs had greater and more uniform reperfusion. On post-transplant days 3-5, the treatment group had lower values compared to the control for creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Histological examination of allograft tissues showed a significant decrease of acute tubular injury in the CD47mAb-treated group compared to control. Compared to the control group, CD47mAb treatment significantly decreased genes expression related to oxidative stress (sod-1, gpx-1, and txn), the inflammatory response (il-2, il-6, inf-g and tgf-b), as well as reduced protein levels of BAX, Caspase-3, MMP2, and MMP9. These data demonstrate that CD47mAb blockade decreases IRI and subsequent tissue injury in DCD renal allografts in a large animal transplant model. This article is protected by copyright.

    "articleAbstract": "Background Asbestos exposure may cause asbestos-related lung diseases including asbestosis, pleural abnormalities, and malignancies. The role of asbestos exposure in the development of small airway obstruction remains controversial. Anatomic and physiologic small airway abnormalities may develop as part of the pathophysiologic process of asbestosis. We hypothesized that inhalation of asbestos may induce small airway defects in addition to asbestosis and pleural abnormalities. Methods In total, 281 patients with newly diagnosed asbestosis were evaluated. Clinical data were collected from the patients' medical charts. The patients were classified into various stages according to their chest X-ray findings using the International Labour Organization classification. Pulmonary function was evaluated by plethysmography and the forced oscillation technique. Results Expiratory flow, including the predicted values of the maximum expiratory flow between 25% and 50% of the forced vital capacity (MEF25-50 ), was significantly lower in the different stages of asbestosis. Accordingly, the predicted percentage of R5- R20 was significantly higher with increasing stages of asbestosis. Furthermore, the duration of exposure to asbestos was significantly associated with the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 )/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and the predicted percentage of MEF25 or MEF50 according to the regression analysis in non-smoking patients with asbestosis. The predicted percentage of FEV1 or the FEV1 /FVC ratio was significantly lower and the predicted percentage of R5- R20 was significantly higher in smokers than non-smokers. Conclusions The patients with asbestosis have small airway obstructive defects that are significantly associated with asbestos exposure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "articleAbstract": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative disorders caused by the presence of an infectious prion protein. The primary site of pathology is the brain characterised by neuroinflammation, astrogliosis, prion fibrils and vacuolation. The events preceding the observed pathology remain in question. We sought to identify biomarkers in the brain of TSE-infected and aged-matched control mice using 2D DIGE. Since the brain proteome is too complex to resolve all proteins using 2D DIGE, protein samples were initially filtered through either concanavalin A (ConA) or wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) columns. Four differentially abundant proteins were identified through screening of the two different glycoproteomes: Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1), calponin-3 (CNN3), peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx6) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Confirmatory Western blots were performed with samples from TSE-infected and comparative Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brains and their respective controls from time points throughout the disease courses. The abundance of three of the four proteins increased significantly during later stages of prion disease whereas NEGR1 decreased in abundance. Comparatively, no significant changes were observed in later stages of AD. Our lab is the first to associate the glycosylated NEGR1 protein with prion disease pathology.

    "articleAbstract": "Infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were recently found to have prolonged auditory brainstem response (ABR); however, at older ages, findings are contradictory. We compared ABR differences between participants with ASD and controls with respect to age using a meta-analysis. Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, HOLLIS, and ScienceDirect from their inception to June 2016. The 25 studies that were included had a total of 1349 participants (727 participants with ASD and 622 controls) and an age range of 0-40 years. Prolongation of the absolute latency of wave V in ASD had a significant negative correlation with age (R2 = 0.23; P = 0.01). The 22 studies below age 18 years showed a significantly prolonged wave V in ASD (Standard Mean Difference = 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5-0.8]; P < 0.001). The 3 studies above 18 years of age showed a significantly shorter wave V in ASD (SMD = -0.6 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.2]; P = 0.004). Prolonged ABR was consistent in infants and children with ASD, suggesting it can serve as an ASD biomarker at infancy. As the ABR is routinely used to screen infants for hearing impairment, the opportunity for replication studies is extensive. Autism Res 2017. © 2017 The Authors Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Our analysis of previous studies showed that infants and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a slower brain response to sound, while adults have a faster brain response to sound. This suggests that slower brain response in infants may predict ASD risk. Brain response to sound is routinely tested on newborns to screen hearing impairment, which has created large data sets to afford replication of these results.",

    "articleAbstract": "Angiosarcomas are rare malignancies arising from cells of endothelial origin and are aggressive sarcomas that can occur in any anatomic site. They are reported to have predilection for the scalp, extremities and breasts. The incidence of these tumors is increasing, which has been suggested to be attributable to the growing use of radiotherapy to treat breast and other malignancies. There is currently limited literature describing the primary cytologic diagnosis of angiosarcoma on fine needle aspirate material. We describe the findings of three cases of angiosarcoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration. Our three cases offer distinct radiologic, clinical and cytopathologic points-of-view: a thyroid angiosarcoma, a mediastinal angiosarcoma and a skin angiosarcoma. The cytomorphology of angiosarcoma is characterized by large highly atypical spindle to epithelioid cells with abundant cytoplasm in dispersed single cells or loose aggregates. The nuclei are large and pleomorphic with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Mitoses are readily identified. The background can be bloody and/or necrotic. Occasional intracytoplasmic lumens are a helpful morphologic feature suggesting vascular differentiation. HHV-8 immunostaining may aid in the differential diagnosis with Kaposi sarcoma while epithelioid hemangioendothelioma can be distinguished based on morphologic features. Given the metastatic potential and high mortality rate associated with these tumors, this entity is an important consideration in the contexts herein described.",

Heparanase has been recently shown to be related to increased inflammation and vulnerability of the atherosclerotic plaques. Herein we aimed to investigate the relationships between OSAS, heparanase and endothelial dysfunction.A total of 120 patients with varying severity of OSAS and 31 controls without OSAS were enrolled. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was measured as an indicator of endothelial dysfunction. Serum heparanase levels were measured with ELISA.Serum heparanase levels increased in a stepwise fashion from controls to patients with more severe OSAS. When FMD was compared with controls and various degrees of severity of OSAS, a stepwise decrease in FMD was observed. Serum heparanase levels were found to be significantly associated with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (r=0.57, p<0.001) and FMD (r= -0.37, p<0.001) in patients with OSAS. Serum heparanase levels were significantly associated with hemoglobin-A1c and body mass index in patients with OSAS. Serum heparanase and uric acid levels were independent predictors of FMD in linear regression analysis (R(2) =0.506, P<0.001; p<0.001 and p=0.001 respectively).Serum heparanase levels were significantly increased in patients with OSAS and associated with the severity of OSAS (AHI) and endothelial dysfunction (FMD). Increased heparanase activity in OSAS may be related to increased cardiovascular risk in patients with OSAS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The essential oils, HSMO and HSFO, respectively, were analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID. A total of 93 components were detected, accounting for 94.8% and 95.3% of HSMO and HSFO, respectively. The prevalent constituents of HSMO were pinocarvone (13.1%), D-germacren-4-ol (12.6%), 1,8-cineole (10.8%), α-pinene (6.4%), and β-pinene (4.8%), whereas the major components of HSFO were 1,8-cineole (20.5%), linalool (16.5%), α-pinene (15.0%), β-pinene (6.4%), and sabinene (6.3%). The different enantiomeric distribution of β-pinene, sabinene, limonene, linalool in the two oils, was determined. The non-volatile esters of p-coumaric and ferulic acids with borneol (1 and 4), cis-chrysanthenol (2 and 5), and cis-pinocarveol (3 and 6) were identified in the leaves after basic hydrolysis and analysis of the NMR spectra of the free acids, and GC-MS spectra of the monoterpene alcohols, respectively. Compounds 2, 3, 5, 6 have been found in nature for the first time. These findings demonstrated that, from a chemical point of view, male and female individuals of H. scabrum collected in Ecuador seem quite differentiated between each other and from samples of the same species growing in Bolivia and in Peru.

    "articleAbstract": "Brain imaging data describe differences in the ASD brain, including amygdala overgrowth, neural interconnectivity, and a three-phase model of neuroanatomical changes from early post-natal development through late adolescence. The pupil reflex test (PRT), a noninvasive measure of brain function, may help improve early diagnosis and elucidate underlying physiology in expression of ASD endophenotype. Commonly observed characteristics of ASD include normal visual acuity but difficulty with eye gaze and photosensitivity, suggesting deficient neuromodulation of cranial nerves. Aims of this study were to confirm sensitivity of the PRT for identifying adolescents with ASD, determine if a phenotype for a subtype of ASD marked by pupil response is present in adolescence, and determine whether differences could be observed on a neurologic exam testing cranial nerves II and III (CNII; CNIII). Using pupillometry, constriction latency was measured serving as a proxy for recording neuromodulation of cranial nerves underlying the pupillary reflex. The swinging flashlight method, used to perform the PRT for measuring constriction latency and return to baseline, discriminated ASD participants from typically developing adolescents on 72.2% of trials. Results further confirmed this measure's sensitivity within a subtype of ASD in later stages of development, serving as a correlate of neural activity within the locus-coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. A brainstem model of atypical PRT in ASD is examined in relation to modulation of cranial nerves and atypical arousal levels subserving the atypical pupillary reflex. Autism Res 2017. © 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Milder forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be difficult to diagnose based on behavioral testing alone. This study used eye-tracking equipment and a hand-held penlight to measure the pupil reflex in adolescents with \"high functioning\" ASD and in adolescents without ASD. The ASD group showed a delay in pupil response. This is the first eye-tracking study to conduct this test as typically performed by a clinical provider, demonstrating differences in older individuals with a subtype of ASD.",

    "articleAbstract": "This study aims to investigate the correlation between α-amylase in tracheal aspirates and risk factors of aspiration, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation; and explore the clinical value of α-amylase for predicting VAP.Tracheal aspirates were collected from elderly patients within two weeks after tracheal intubation in mechanical ventilation, and α-amylase was detected. Patients were grouped according to the presence of VAP. The correlation between α-amylase and risk factors of aspiration before intubation, as well as VAP, were analyzed.The sample of this study was comprised of 147 patients. The average age of these patients was 86.9 years old. The incidence of VAP was 21% during the study period. Tracheal aspirate α-amylase level increased with the increase in the number of risk factors for aspiration before intubation, α-amylase level was significantly higher in the VAP group than in the non-VAP group, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the diagnostic value of α-amylase for VAP was 0.813 (95% CI: 0.721-0.896), threshold value was 4,681.5 U/L, sensitivity was 0.801, and specificity was 0.793. Logistic multivariate analysis revealed the following risk factors for VAP: a number of risk factors before intubation of ≥3, a Glasgow score of <8 points, the absence of continuous aspiration of subglottic secretion, and a tracheal aspirate α-amylase level of >4,681.5 U/L.Tracheal aspirate α-amylase can serve as a biomarker for predicting VAP in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

    "articleAbstract": "We propose a driving force hypothesis based on previous thermodynamics, kinetics and structural data as well as additional experiments and calculations presented here on water-related phenomena in the actomyosin systems. Although Szent-Györgyi pointed out the importance of water in muscle contraction in 1951, few studies have focused on the water science of muscle because of the difficulty of analyzing hydration properties of the muscle proteins, actin and myosin. The thermodynamics and energetics of muscle contraction are linked to the water-mediated regulation of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions along with structural changes in protein molecules. In this study, we assume the following two points: (1) the periodic electric field distribution along an actin filament (F-actin) is unidirectionally modified upon binding of myosin subfragment 1 (M or myosin S1) with ADP and inorganic phosphate Pi (M.ADP.Pi complex) and (2) the solvation free energy of myosin S1 depends on the external electric field strength and the solvation free energy of myosin S1 in close proximity to F-actin can become the potential force to drive myosin S1 along F-actin. The first assumption is supported by integration of experimental reports. The second assumption is supported by model calculations utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine solvation free energies of a small organic molecule and two small proteins. MD simulations utilize the energy representation method (ER) and the roughly proportional relationship between the solvation free energy and the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the protein. The estimated driving force acting on myosin S1 is as high as several piconewtons (pN), which is consistent with the experimentally observed force. This article is protected by copyright.

    "articleAbstract": "Equivalent Square (ES) enables the calculation of many radiation quantities for rectangular treatment fields, based only on measurements from square fields. While it is widely applied in radiotherapy, its accuracy, especially for extremely elongated fields, still leaves room for improvement. In this study, we introduce a novel explicit ES formula based on Weighted Power Mean (WPM) function and compare its performance with the Sterling formula and Vadash/Bjärngard's formula.The proposed WPM formula is ESWPMa,b=waα+1-wbα1/α for a rectangular photon field with sides a and b. The formula performance was evaluated by three methods: standard deviation of model fitting residual error, maximum relative model prediction error, and model's Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Testing datasets included the ES table from British Journal of Radiology (BJR), photon output factors (Scp ) from the Varian TrueBeam Representative Beam Data (Med Phys. 2012;39:6981-7018), and published Scp data for Varian TrueBeam Edge (J Appl Clin Med Phys. 2015;16:125-148).For the BJR dataset, the best-fit parameter value α = -1.25 achieved a 20% reduction in standard deviation in ES estimation residual error compared with the two established formulae. For the two Varian datasets, employing WPM reduced the maximum relative error from 3.5% (Sterling) or 2% (Vadash/Bjärngard) to 0.7% for open field sizes ranging from 3 cm to 40 cm, and the reduction was even more prominent for 1 cm field sizes on Edge (J Appl Clin Med Phys. 2015;16:125-148). The AIC value of the WPM formula was consistently lower than its counterparts from the traditional formulae on photon output factors, most prominent on very elongated small fields.The WPM formula outperformed the traditional formulae on three testing datasets. With increasing utilization of very elongated, small rectangular fields in modern radiotherapy, improved photon output factor estimation is expected by adopting the WPM formula in treatment planning and secondary MU check.",

    "articleAbstract": "Social structure can have a significant impact on divergence and evolution within species, especially in the marine environment, which has few environmental boundaries to dispersal. On the other hand, genetic structure can affect social structure in many species, through an individual preference toward associating with relatives. One social species, the short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), has been shown to live in stable social groups for periods of at least a decade. Using mitochondrial control sequences from 242 individuals and SNPs from 106 individuals, we examine population structure among geographic and social groups of short-finned pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, and test for links between social and genetic structure. Our results show that there are at least two geographic populations in the Hawaiian Islands: a Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands/Pelagic population (FST and ΦST P < 0.001), as well as an eastern MHI community and a western MHI community (FST P = 0.009). We find genetically-driven social structure, or high relatedness among social units and clusters (P < 0.001), and a positive relationship between relatedness and association between individuals (P < 0.0001). Further, socially-organized clusters are genetically distinct, indicating that social structure drives genetic divergence within the population, likely through restricted mate selection (FST P = 0.05). This genetic divergence among social groups can make the species less resilient to anthropogenic or ecological disturbance. Conservation of this species therefore depends on understanding links among social structure, genetic structure, and ecological variability within the species. This article is protected by copyright.

Patients with myasthenia, thymic carcinomas, tumors with undetermined histology, and more advanced stage thymoma patients were excluded. We compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) according to the extent of thymic resection, tumor staging, and size.One hundred and eighteen patients were staged as early thymoma. TM was performed in 43 (35.6%) patients and TMM in 75 (64.4%). Forty-nine (65.3%) patients with a tumor ≤ 3 cm underwent TMM, and 9 (20.9%) TM. Twenty-six (34.7%) patients with a tumor > 3 cm underwent TMM, and 34 (79.1%) TM. Seventy-four patients were categorized as stage I: 57 (76%) underwent TMM and 17 (39.5%) TM. Forty-four patients were categorized as stage II: 18 (24%) underwent TMM and 26 (60.5%) TM. There was no statistically significant difference in recurrence between the groups (P = 0.250).No difference in the rate of recurrence was observed in early stage non-myasthenic patients following thymic resection and Masaoka-Koga staging. However, TM is considered a better option for early stage thymoma patients with tumors > 3 cm.",

    "articleAbstract": "In animals that use chemical communication during courtship and reproduction, speciation is often associated with divergence of their sex pheromones. In multicomponent pheromone systems, divergence can be obtained either by adding or deleting components, or by altering the relative contribution of individual components to the mixture. Protein pheromone systems can additionally evolve by amino acid sequence divergence to produce pheromones with a species-specific effect. The sodefrin precursor-like factor (SPF) pheromone system, a blend of proteins that essentially enhances receptivity in salamanders, has had a long and dynamic evolution of gene duplications, but the mechanisms that govern interspecific divergence and the role they play in reproductive isolation remain elusive. Here we use transcriptomics and proteomics to characterize the SPF protein repertoire of the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris), and compare it to the previously identified repertoire of SPF proteins of the palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus), a related but non-hybridising species. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses indicate that, despite the availability of multiple SPF gene copies, both species predominantly express the same subset of orthologs. Our study demonstrates that species specificity in the SPF protein pheromone system can be established by gradual sequence divergence of the same set of proteins alone.

Firstly, PdnL2n (n = 6, 8, and 9), which are perfectly closed structures smaller than the Pd12L24 sphere, and a mixture of intermediates not observed by NMR (Int) were produced. Next, the sphere was assembled from intra-/intermolecular reaction of a certain class of Int (path A) and from the coordination of free pyridyl groups in Int to the Pd(II) center of PdnL2n (n = 6, 8, and 9) (path B). While capping the free pyridyl groups in Int with Pd(II) ions perfectly inhibited the sphere formation, the addition of free L to Int accelerated the formation of the sphere.",

In addition to antibiotics for an unspecified period of time, CPPE/empyemas can initially be treated with a therapeutic thoracentesis (which can be repeated if necessary), the insertion of a small-bore chest catheter under ultrasound guidance, or the administration through the catheter of fibrinolytics alone, saline alone, or fibrinolytics in combination with either saline or deoxyribonuclease.

First, we formed fine pores on the surface of each substrate by a short-time sulfuric acid treatment. Second, in order to provide hydrophilic property, we treated the surfaces of each substrate with oxygen plasma. Finally, we deposited fine particles of amorphous calcium phosphate (PrAp) in the pores by soaking each substrate in SBF adjusted at pH 8.40, 25.0°C, and subsequently kept at 70.0°C for 24 h. By this treatment, we obtained the bioactive fiber-reinforced polymers. By soaking thus-obtained each material in SBF, apatite formation was induced on the whole surface of each substrate within 1 day by PrAp deposited in the pores and high apatite-forming ability was performed on each material. The adhesive strength between the apatite layer showed high value by mechanical anchoring effect generated by the apatite formed in the pores. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "articleAbstract": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to cause cholestasis in sepsis. There is evidence that a defective expression of canalicular aquaporin water channels contributes to bile secretory failure in LPS-induced cholestasis. Thus, we studied whether the hepatic adenovirus-mediated transfer of human aquaporin-1 gene (haqp1) can improve the cholestasis induced by LPS. Adenoviral vector encoding hAQP1 (AdhAQP1) or control vector was administered to rats by retrograde intrabiliary infusion. Hepatocyte canalicular hAQP1 expression was assessed by liver immunostaining and immunoblotting in purified plasma membranes. LPS reduced bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion by 30% and 45%, respectively. AdhAQP1-treatment normalized both bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion in LPS-induced cholestasis. Moreover, markedly elevated serum bile acid levels in cholestatic rats, were also normalized with the AdhAQP1 hepatic transduction. Bile flow and serum or biliary bile acids in normal rats were not significantly altered by AdhAQP1. AdhAQP1 delivery unaffected the downregulated protein expression of canalicular bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) in cholestasis, but improved its transport activity restoring reduced canalicular cholesterol content. Our data suggest that the adenovirus-mediated hepatocyte hAQP1 expression improves LPS-induced cholestasis in rats by stimulating the BSEP/ABCB11-mediated biliary bile acid excretion; a finding that might contribute to the understanding and treatment of sepsis-associated cholestatic diseases. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 2017.",

    "articleAbstract": "Burnout is a construct that has garnered considerable attention in sport psychology within recent years. Several hypothesized models regarding how the three dimensions (exhaustion, devaluation, and reduced sense of accomplishment) temporally relate to each other have been advanced. One proposal outlined by Maslach and Leiter suggests that exhaustion predicts devaluation which predicts reduced sense of accomplishment. However, there is not consensus amongst researchers as it has been argued that exhaustion predicts devaluation and reduced accomplishment separately. The aim of this paper was to test multiple alternative hypotheses regarding the relationships of the burnout dimensions in athletes. Two samples of Swedish youth elite athletes with differing time-spans between measurements were used. Specifically, one sample involved time intensive measures collected every week over an eight week period, the other sample included four measurement points across an 18 month period. Results showed that none of the previously proposed models outlining the burnout dimensions temporal relations were supported. Statistical analysis of the models including the cross lagged predictions of dimensions did not have any statistically significant impact except when exhaustion negatively predicted devaluation between time one (month zero) and time two (month six) in the 18 month sample; this relation faded in the following timepoints. Further, issues regarding the stability of devaluation and reduced sense of accomplishment emerged as their autocorrelation were very weak in the time intensive sample. These findings raise a number of points for further theoretical and practical discussions about the athlete burnout construct. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "articleAbstract": "Bark and ambrosia beetles are highly specialized weevils (Curculionidae) that have established diverse symbioses with fungi, most often from the order Ophiostomatales (Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes). The two types of beetles are distinguished by their feeding habits and intimacy of interactions with their symbiotic fungi. The tree tissue diet of bark beetles is facilitated by fungi, while ambrosia beetles feed solely on fungi that they farm. The farming life history strategy requires domestication of a fungus, which the beetles consume as their sole food source. Ambrosia beetles in the subfamily Platypodinae originated in the mid-Cretaceous (119-88Mya) and are the oldest known group of farming insects. However, attempts to resolve phylogenetic relationships and the timing of domestication events for fungal cultivars have been largely inconclusive. We sequenced the genomes of 12 ambrosia beetle fungal cultivars and bark beetle associates, including the devastating laurel wilt pathogen, Raffaelea lauricola, to estimate a robust phylogeny of the Ophiostomatales. We find evidence for contemporaneous diversification of the beetles and their associated fungi, followed by three independent domestication events of the ambrosia fungi genus Raffaelea. We estimate the first domestication of an Ophiostomatales fungus occurred ~86Mya, 25 million years earlier than prior estimates and in close agreement with the estimated age of farming in the Platypodinae (96Mya). Comparisons of the timing of fungal domestication events with the timing of beetle radiations support the hypothesis that the first large beetle radiations may have spread domesticated 'ambrosia' fungi to other fungi-associated beetle groups, perhaps facilitating the evolution of new farming lineages.

    "articleAbstract": "Compared to terminal differentiated cells, stem cells play important roles in the maintenance and regeneration, and thus have been intensively researched as the most promising cell based therapy. In order to maximize the effectiveness of stem cell based therapies, it is essential to understand the environmental (niche) signals that regulate stem cell behavior. Recent findings suggest that fibroblasts have a mesenchymal origin and that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) demonstrate proangiogenic function, where both fibrogenic and angiogenic activities are associated with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a matricellular protein that serves as an essential mediator of skeletogenesis in development and vascular remodeling. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that upon local delivery of CTGF from a three dimensional (3D) nanocomposite scaffold, human induced pluripotent stem cells derived MSCs can be directed to differentiate toward fibroblasts in a 3D nanocomposite scaffold in female nonobese diabetic CB-17/Icr-severe combined immunodeficient mice. The stem cell-scaffold constructs present not only intriguingly strong fibroblastic commitments but also angiogenic induction in vivo. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The authors observed 627 patients with prehypertension in the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region. Rank correlation analysis revealed that interleukin 6 expression exhibited significant positive correlations with urinary sodium (R = .13) and sodium to potassium ratio (R = .13). The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of 24-hour urinary sodium was 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.00 - 1.01) for hypertension and 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.00 - 1.02) for cardiovascular disease, whereas the hazard ratio for 24-hour urinary sodium to potassium ratio was 1.13 (95% confidence interval, 1.08 - 1.19) for hypertension and 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 - 1.17) for cardiovascular disease. The study suggests that a high-salt diet may lead to increased interleukin 6 levels and may contribute to hypertension. In addition, a high sodium to potassium ratio and high sodium levels are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in patients with prehypertension.",

    "articleAbstract": "The early stages of fibril formation are difficult to capture in solution. We use cold ion spectroscopy to examine an 11-residue peptide derived from the protein transthyretin, and clusters of this fibre forming peptide containing up to five units in the gas phase. For each oligomer, the UV spectra exhibit distinct changes in the electronic environment of aromatic residues in this peptide compared to that of the monomer and in bulk solution. The UV spectra of the tetra- and pentamer are superimposable, but differ significantly from the spectra of the monomer and trimer. Such spectral evolution suggests that a common structural motif is formed as early as the tetramer. The presence of this stable motif is further supported by low conformational heterogeneity of the tetra- and pentamer, revealed from their IR spectra. From comparison of the IR-spectra in the gas and condensed phases we propose putative assignments for the dominant motif in the oligomers.",

    "articleAbstract": "Dibutyltin (DBT) is the degradation products of TBT, which is generally considered higher toxicity than TBT in the immune system. In order to learn more about the mechanisms of immune-toxic of DBT, we exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/L DBT for 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, we determined the immune parameters and immune-related genes. The results showed that with an increase in TBT dose, lysozyme activities and IgM, C3, C4 content in intestine, skin and spleen were all significantly inhibited by the DBT exposure. Fish exposed to 10 ng/L and 100 ng/L showed significantly lower lysozyme activities and IgM, C3, C4 content than those of the control group. Zebrafish exposed to 10 ng/L and 100 ng/L DBT, the mRNA transcript levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon γ2 (INFγ2), nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-kB p65), inhibitor protein-κBα (IκBα), IκB kinases β (IKKβ), Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and the signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins (STATs) all increased with the DBT levels in the intestine and spleen. Those parameters showed significantly higher values in 10 ng/L and 100 ng/L than those of fish in the control group. However, no significant difference was found in IκB kinases α (IKKα) and IκB kinase γ (IKKγ) mRNA levels in the intestine and spleen. These data imply that DBT might be via suppression on IKKβ/IkBa/NF-kBp65 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways to regulate the immunity of zebrafish.",

    "articleAbstract": "As the application of biocatalysis to complement conventional chemical and catalytic approaches continues to expand, an increasing number of reactions involve poorly-water soluble substrates. At required industrial concentrations necessary for industrial implementation, this frequently leads to heterogeneous reaction mixtures composed of multiple phases. Such systems are challenging to sample and therefore it is problematic to measure representative component concentrations. In this work we demonstrate and validate an online method for following the progress of oxygen-dependent reactions through accurate measurement of the oxygen mass balance in the gas-phase of a reactor. The method was successfully validated and demonstrated using two model reactions: firstly the oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase and secondly the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of macrocyclic ketones to lactones. Initial reaction rate constants and time-course progressions calculated from the oxygen mass balance were validated against conventional online methods of dissolved oxygen tension and pH titration measurements. A feasible operating window as well as the sensitivity to dynamic changes of reaction rates was established by controlling oxygen transfer via the operating parameters of the reactor. Such kinetic data forms the basis for reaction characterisation, from which bottlenecks may be made evident and directed improvement strategies can be identified and implemented.",

    "articleAbstract": "Genetic diversity is crucial for species' maintenance and persistence, yet is often overlooked in conservation studies. Species diversity is more often reported due to practical constraints, but it is unknown if these measures of diversity are correlated. In marine invertebrates, adults are often sessile or sedentary and populations exchange genes via dispersal of gametes and larvae. Species with a larval period are expected to have more connected populations than those without larval dispersal. We assessed the relationship between measures of species and genetic diversity, and between dispersal ability and connectivity. We compiled data on genetic patterns and life history traits in nine species across five phyla. Sampling sites spanned 600 km in the northwest Mediterranean Sea and focused on a 50 km area near Marseilles, France. Comparative population genetic approaches yielded three main results. (1) Species without larvae showed higher levels of genetic structure than species with free-living larvae but the role of larval type (lecithotrophic or planktotrophic) was negligible. (2) A narrow area around Marseilles, subject to offshore advection, limited genetic connectivity in most species. (3) We identified sites with significant positive contributions to overall genetic diversity across all species, corresponding with areas near low human population densities. In contrast, high levels of human activity corresponded with a negative contribution to overall genetic diversity. Genetic diversity within species was positively and significantly linearly related with local species diversity. Our study suggests that local contribution to overall genetic diversity should be taken into account for future conservation strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "articleAbstract": "Numerous kidney exchange (kidney paired donor (KPD)) registries in the U.S have gradually shifted to high frequency match-runs, raising the question of whether this harms the number of transplants. We conduct simulations using clinical data from two KPD registries-the Alliance for Paired Donation, which runs multi-hospital exchanges, and Methodist San Antonio, which runs single center exchanges-to study how the frequency of match-runs impacts the number of transplants and the average waiting times. We simulate the options facing each of the two registries by repeated resampling from their historical pools of patient-donor pairs and non-directed donors, with arrival and departure rates corresponding to the historical data. We find that longer intervals between match-runs do not increase the total number of transplants, and that prioritizing highly sensitized patients is more effective than waiting longer between match-runs for transplanting highly sensitized patients. While we do not find that frequent match-runs result in fewer transplanted pairs we do find that increasing arrival rates of new pairs improves both the fraction of transplanted pairs and waiting times.

    "articleAbstract": "Functional genomics has transformed from futuristic concept to well established scientific discipline during last decade. Cotton functional genomics promise to enhance the understanding of fundamental plant biology to systematically exploit genetic resources for improvement of cotton fiber quality and yield, as well as utilization of genetic information for germplasm improvement. However, determining the cotton gene functions is a much more challenging task which has not progressed at rapid pace. This article presents a comprehensive overview on the recent tools and resources available with the major advances in cotton functional genomics to develop elite cotton genotypes. This effort ultimately helps to filter a subset of genes which can be used to assemble a final list of candidate genes that could be employed in future novel cotton breeding program. We argue that next stage of cotton functional genomics requires the draft genomes refinement, re-sequencing broad diversity panels with the development of high-throughput functional genomics tools and integrating multidisciplinary approaches in upcoming cotton improvement programs.

    "articleAbstract": "Environmental factors, including temperature, can have large effects on species interactions, including mutualisms and antagonisms. Most insect species are infected with heritable bacterial symbionts with many protecting their hosts from natural enemies. However, many symbionts or their products are thermally sensitive hence their effectiveness may vary across a range of temperatures. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, the bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa, and its associated APSE bacteriophages confer resistance to this aphid's dominant parasitoid, Aphidius ervi. Here we investigate the effects of temperature on both endogenous and symbiont-based protection against this parasitoid. We also explored the defensive properties of the X-type symbiont, a bacterium hypothesized to shape aphid defense when co-occurring with H. defensa. We show that H. defensa protection fails at higher temperatures, although some aphid genotype and H. defensa strain combinations are more robust than others at moderately warmer temperatures. We also found that a single X-type strain neither defended against parasitism by A. ervi nor rescued lost H. defensa protection at higher temperatures. In contrast, endogenous aphid resistance was effective across temperatures, revealing that these distinct defensive modes are not equally robust to changing environments. Through a survey of field-collected pea aphids we found a negative correlation between H. defensa frequencies and average daily temperatures across North American locales, fitting expectations for reduced symbiont benefits under warm climates. Based on these findings, we propose that rising global temperatures could promote the widespread breakdown of defensive mutualisms, a prospect with implications for both human and ecosystem health.

    "articleAbstract": "Drug-eluting stents (DESs) are generally used in percutaneous coronary intervention. Paclitaxel (PTX) is widely used in DESs to suppress neointima, which causes restenosis. However, the PTX release profile is slow owing to its hydrophobic properties, resulting in negative effects on re-endothelialization in vessels. In this study, we assessed the effects of the controlled release of PTX particles of specific sizes on in-stent restenosis (ISR). PTX particle sizes were controlled by adjusting the evaporating temperature of the solvent from 25 to 80°C during ultrasonic coating, and DESs were prepared. The properties of prepared films and DESs were analyzed, and cell viability was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/PTX500-loaded stents showed the most rapid release for 58 days, and smaller drug particles exhibited lower PTX release rates. In vivo, PLGA/PTX50-, PLGA/PTX250-, and PLGA/PTX500-loaded stents showed good efficacy for alleviating ISR as compared with bare metal stents and PLGA/PTX5-loaded stents. However, PLGA/PTX250- and PLGA/PTX500-loaded stents exhibited strut exposure and reduced recovery of the vascular compared with PLGA/PTX50-loaded stents. PTX drug particles of approximately 50 nm were most effective in vivo, and the control of particle size is a promising strategy for improving the performance of PTX-eluting stents. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Dox promoted apoptosis and ROS generation and inhibited viability in a dose-dependent manner. Then, the phosphorylation levels of JNK, ERK, and NF-κB evaluated by western blot were elevated. We used inhibitors of JNK, ERK, and NF-κB to determine which of these proteins were involved in Dox-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Dox-exposed cells were treated with DATS at doses of 1, 5, and 10 μM, and the data demonstrated that ROS generation and apoptotic proteins were decreased and that ERK and NF-κB were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, six-week-old rats were divided into three groups (n = 6 per group) designed as an eight-week study. Normal, Dox (at dose 3.75 mg/kg by ip) administered with or without DATS (at dose 40 mg/kg by gavage) treatment groups. The results indicate that cardiac dysfunction, apoptosis, and JNK, ERK, and NF-κB activation by Dox were reversed by treatment with DATS.DATS appears to suppress Dox-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inhibiting NADPH oxidase-related ROS production and the downstream JNK/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway; DATS may possess clinical therapeutic potential by blocking Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.",

    "articleAbstract": "Plant-associated soil microbes are important mediators of plant defense responses to diverse aboveground pathogen and insect challengers. For example, closely related strains of beneficial rhizosphere Pseudomonas spp. can induce systemic resistance (ISR), systemic susceptibility (ISS), or neither against the bacterial foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto DC3000). Using a model system composed of root-associated Pseudomonas spp. strains, the foliar pathogen Pto DC3000, and the herbivore Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper), we found that rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas spp. that induce either ISS and ISR against Pto DC3000 all increased resistance to herbivory by T. ni. We found that resistance to T. ni and resistance to Pto DC3000 are quantitative metrics of the Jasmonic Acid (JA)/ Salicylic Acid (SA) tradeoff and distinct strains of rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas spp. have distinct effects on the JA/SA tradeoff. Using genetic analysis and transcriptional profiling, we provide evidence that treatment of Arabidopsis with Pseudomonas sp. CH267, which induces ISS against bacterial pathogens, tips the JA/SA tradeoff towards JA-dependent defenses against herbivores at the cost of a subset of SA-mediated defenses against bacterial pathogens. In contrast, treatment of Arabidopsis with the ISR strain Pseudomonas sp. WCS417 disrupts JA/SA antagonism and simultaneously primes plants for both JA- and SA-mediated defenses. Our findings show that ISS against the bacterial foliar pathogens triggered by Pseudomonas sp. CH267, which is a seemingly deleterious phenotype, may in fact be an adaptive consequence of increased resistance to herbivory. Our work shows that pleotropic effects of microbiome modulation of plant defenses are important to consider when using microbes to modify plant traits in agriculture.

    "articleAbstract": "Processing of double-stranded RNA precursors into small RNAs is an essential regulator of gene expression in plant development and stress response. Small RNA processing requires the combined activity of a functionally diverse group of molecular components. However, in most plant species, there are insufficient mutant resources to functionally characterize each encoding gene. Here, mutations in loci encoding protein machinery involved in small RNA processing in soybean and Medicago truncatula were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 and TAL-effector nuclease (TALEN) mutagenesis platforms. An efficient CRISPR/Cas9 reagent was used to create a bi-allelic double-mutant for the two soybean paralogous Double-stranded RNA-binding2 (GmDrb2a and GmDrb2b) genes. These mutations, along with a CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutation of the M. truncatula Hua enhancer1 (MtHen1) gene, were determined to be germ-line transmissible. Furthermore, TALENs were used to generate a mutation within the soybean Dicer-like2 gene. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the soybean Dicer-like3 gene and the GmHen1a gene were observed in the T0 generation, but these mutations failed to transmit to the T1 generation. The irregular transmission of induced mutations and the corresponding transgenes was investigated by whole genome sequencing to reveal a spectrum of non-germline targeted mutations and multiple transgene insertion events. Finally, a suite of combinatorial mutant plants were generated by combining the previously reported Gmdcl1a, Gmdcl1b and Gmdcl4b mutants with the Gmdrb2ab double mutant. Altogether, this study demonstrates the synergistic use of different genome engineering platforms to generate a collection of useful mutant plant lines for future study of small RNA processing in legume crops.

    "articleAbstract": "Permafrost represents an important understudied genetic resource. Soil microorganisms play important roles in regulating biogeochemical cycles and maintaining ecosystem function. However, our knowledge of patterns and drivers of permafrost microbial communities is limited over broad geographic scales. Using high-throughput Illumina sequencing, this study compared soil bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities between the active and permafrost layers on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that microbial alpha diversity was significantly higher in the active layer than in the permafrost layer with the exception of fungal Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index, and microbial community structures were significantly different between the two layers. Our results also revealed that environmental factors such as soil fertility (soil organic carbon and nitrogen contents) were the primary drivers of the beta diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the active layer. In contrast, environmental variables such as the mean annual precipitation and total phosphorus played dominant roles in driving the microbial beta diversity in the permafrost layer. Spatial distance was important for predicting the bacterial and archaeal beta diversity in both the active and permafrost layers, but not for fungal communities. Collectively, these results demonstrated different driving factors of microbial beta diversity between the active layer and permafrost layer, implying that the drivers of the microbial beta diversity observed in the active layer cannot be used to predict the biogeographic patterns of the microbial beta diversity in the permafrost layer.

Although the role of elevated extracellular calcium concentration in keratinocyte differentiation is well understood, the effect of high calcium on dsRNA sensors is not well studied. We investigated alterations in dsRNA sensor expression and antiviral activity induced by a high extracellular concentration of calcium in epidermal keratinocytes. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were stimulated with high calcium and/or synthetic dsRNA, poly (I:C). TLR3, IFIH1 (MDA5), and DDX58 (RIG-I) expression were measured via qPCR, and IFN-β and human beta defensin 2 (HBD2) levels were measured using ELISA. TLR3 localization was evaluated with immunocytofluorescence. Antiviral activity was quantified with virus plaque assays using herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1). High calcium significantly upregulated mRNA expression of TLR3, IFIH1, and DDX58 in NHEKs. In addition, high calcium significantly enhanced poly (I:C)-induced anti-HSV-1 activity in NHEKs. The anti-viral molecule, HBD2 but not IFN-β induction by poly (I:C) was enhanced by high calcium. Our findings indicate that high levels of extracellular calcium enhance the expression of dsRNA sensors and augment antiviral activity in epidermal keratinocytes.

    "articleAbstract": "How long-term antibiotic treatment affects host bacterial associations is still largely unknown. The honeybee-gut microbiota has a simple composition, so we used this gut community to investigate how long-term antibiotic treatment affects host-associated microbiota. We investigated the phylogenetic relatedness, genomic content (GC percentage, genome size, number of genes, and CRISPR), and antibiotic-resistant genes for strains from two abundant members of the honeybee core gut microbiota (Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi). Domesticated honeybees are subjected to geographically different management policies, so we used two research apiaries, representing different antibiotic treatment regimens in their apiculture: Low antibiotic usage (Norway) and high antibiotic usage (Arizona, USA). We applied whole-genome shotgun sequencing on 48 G. apicola and 22 S. alvi. We identified three predominating subgroups of G. apicola in honeybees from both Norway and Arizona. For G. apicola, genetic content substantially varied between subgroups and distance-similarity calculations showed similarity discrepancy between subgroups. Functional differences between subgroups, such as pectin-degrading enzymes (G. apicola), were also identified. In addition, we identified horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of transposon- (Tn10) associated tetracycline resistance (Tet B) across the G. apicola subgroups in the Arizonan honeybees, using interspace polymorphisms in the Tet B determinant. Our results support that honeybee-gut symbiont subgroups can resist long-term antibiotic treatment and maintain functionality through acquisition of geographically distinct antibiotic-resistant genes by HGT.

    "articleAbstract": "The projected increases in sea levels are expected to affect coastal ecosystems. Tropical communities, anchored by mangrove trees and having experienced frequent past sea level changes, appear to be vibrant at present. However, any optimism about the resilience of these ecosystems is premature because the impact of past climate events may not be reflected in the current abundance. To assess the impact of historical sea level changes, we conducted an extensive genetic diversity survey on the Indo-Malayan coast, a hotspot with a large global mangrove distribution. A survey of 26 populations in six species reveals extremely low genome-wide nucleotide diversity and hence very small effective population sizes (Ne ) in all populations. Whole-genome sequencing of three mangrove species further shows the decline in Ne to be strongly associated with the speed of past changes in sea level. We also used a recent series of flooding events in Yalong Bay, southern China, to test the robustness of mangroves to sea level changes in relation to their genetic diversity. The events resulted in the death of half of the mangrove trees in this area. Significantly, less genetically diverse mangrove species suffered much greater destruction. The dieback was accompanied by a drastic reduction in local invertebrate biodiversity. We thus predict that tropical coastal communities will be seriously endangered as the global sea level rises. Well-planned coastal development near mangrove forests will be essential to avert this crisis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Our study used a custom designed group-specific primer set and next-generation sequencing for the detection of three species at risk; (Eastern Sand Darter, Ammocrypta pellucida; Northern Madtom, Noturus stigmosus; and Silver Shiner, Notropis photogenis), one invasive species (Round Goby, Neogobius melanostomus) and an additional 78 native species from two large Great Lakes tributary rivers in southern Ontario, Canada; the Grand River and the Sydenham River. Out of 82 fish species detected in both rivers using capture-based and eDNA methods, our eDNA method detected 86.2% and 72.0% of the fish species in the Grand River and the Sydenham River, respectively, which included our four target species. Our analyses also identified significant positive and negative species co-occurrence patterns between our target species and other identified species. Our results demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding that targets the fish community as well as individual species of interest provides a better understanding of factors affecting the target species spatial distribution in an ecosystem than possible with only target species data. Additionally, eDNA is easily implemented as an initial survey tool, or alongside capture-based methods, for improved mapping of species distribution patterns. This article is protected by copyright.

    "articleAbstract": "Migration is a ubiquitous life history trait with profound evolutionary and ecological consequences. Recent developments in telemetry and genomics, when combined, can bring significant insights on the migratory ecology of non-model organisms in the wild. Here, we used this integrative approach to document dispersal, gene flow and potential for local adaptation in anadromous Arctic Char from six rivers in the Canadian Arctic. Acoustic telemetry data from 124 tracked individuals indicated asymmetric dispersal, with a large proportion of fish (72%) tagged in three different rivers migrating up the same short river in the fall. Population genomics data from 6,136 SNP markers revealed weak, albeit significant, population differentiation (average pairwise FST = 0.011) and asymmetric dispersal was also revealed by population assignments. Approximate Bayesian Computation simulations suggested the presence of asymmetric gene flow, although in the opposite direction to that observed from the telemetry data, suggesting that dispersal does not necessarily lead to gene flow. These observations suggested that Arctic Char home to their natal river to spawn, but may overwinter in rivers with the shortest migratory route to minimize the costs of migration in non-breeding years. Genome scans and genetic-environment associations identified 90 outlier markers putatively under selection, 23 of which were in or near a gene. Of these, at least four were involved in muscle and cardiac function, consistent with the hypothesis that migratory harshness could drive local adaptation. Our study illustrates the power of integrating genomics and telemetry to study migrations in non-model organisms in logistically challenging environments such as the Arctic.

However, despite of wide variety of commercially available isobaric tags, none of the currently available methods offers significant improvement of sensitivity of detection during MS experiment. Recently, many strategies were applied to increase the ionization efficiency of peptides involving chemical modifications introducing quaternary ammonium fixed charge. Here, we present a novel quaternary ammonium based isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification of peptides (QAS-iTRAQ 2-plex). Upon collisional activation, the new stable benzylic-type cationic reporter ion is liberated from the tag. Deuterium atoms were used to offset the differential masses of an reporter group. We tested the applicability of QAS-iTRAQ 2-plex reagent on a series of model peptides as well as bovine serum albumin tryptic digest. Obtained results suggest usefulness of this isobaric ionization tag for relative and absolute quantification of peptides.",

    "articleAbstract": "Hyaluronate is produced in high amount during the initial stages of regeneration of the tail and limbs of lizards, newts, and frog tadpoles. The fine distribution of hyaluronate in the regenerating tail blastemas has been assessed by ultrastructural immunolocalization of the Hyaluronate Binding Protein (HABP), a protein that indirectly reveals the presence of hyaluronate in tissues. The present electron microscopic study shows that HABP is detected in the cytoplasm but this proteins is mainly localized on the surfaces of cells in the wound epidermis and mesenchymal cells of the blastema. HABP appears, therefore, accumulated along the cell surface, indicating that hyaluronate coats these embryonic-like cells and their antigens. The high level of hyaluronate in the blastema, aside favoring tissue hydration, cell movements, and remodeling for blastema formation and growth, likely elicits a protection from the possible immune-reaction of lymphocytes and macrophages to embryonic-fetal-like antigens present on the surface of blastema and epidermal cells. Their survival, therefore, allows the continuous multiplication of these cells in regions rich in hyaluronate, promoting the regeneration of a new tail or limbs. The study suggests that organ regeneration in vertebrates is only possible in the presence of high hyaluronate content and hydration. These two conditions facilitate cell movement, immune-protection, and activate the Wnt signaling pathway, like during development.",

Patients filled daily diaries for 15 days to monitor patient reported experience. Primary outcome was change in position of the gingival margin. Multilevel analysis used centre, subject, and tooth as levels and baseline parameters as covariates.Average baseline recession was 2.5 ± 1.0 mm. The surgery was 15.7 minutes shorter (95%CI from 11.9 to 19.6, P<0.0001) and perceived lighter (11.9 VAS units, 95%CI from 4.6 to 19.1, P=0.0014) in CMX subjects. Time to recovery was 1.8 days shorter in CMX. Six-month root coverage was 1.7 ± 1.1 mm for CMX and 2.1 ± 1.0 mm for CTG (difference of 0.44 mm, 95%CI from 0.25 to 0.63 mm). The upper limit of the confidence interval was over the non-inferiority margin of 0.25 mm. Odds of complete root coverage were significantly higher for CTG (OR = 4.0, 95% CI 1.8-8.8).Replacing CTG with CMX shortens time to recovery and decreases morbidity but the tested generation of devices is probably inferior to autologous CTG in terms of root coverage.

TTI ≤65s predicted absence of acute reconnection with 84.2% sensitivity and 75.7% specificity, whereas TCI ≤119s presented 94.7% sensitivity and 80.2% specificity. At a mean follow-up of 4.7±1.4months, 82.2% of patients were free of AF. None of those with PV reconnections suffered from AF recurrences.The ablation using CB2 is effective in achieving acute PV isolation. Real-time assessment of PV isolation could be achieved during CB application in 86% of PVs. The incidence of spontaneous PV reconnection is very low observing just in 3% of isolated PVs. TTI≤ 65s and TCI≤119s predicted absence of acute PV reconnection.

    "articleAbstract": "The cranial openings of nervus hypoglossus, the 12th cranial nerve, are for the first time studied across a broad range of higher avian taxa. This nerve plays an important role in the innervation of the syrinx and exits the skull through a variable number of foramina. Most previous authors described 2-3 foramina nervi hypoglossi (FNH) for neornithine birds, but the number, size, and arrangement of FNH is actually more variable than what is apparent from the literature. In the case of three foramina, there is usually a pair of caudal foramina and a rostral one, but even in closely related taxa, a great variability of the FNH pattern may exist. Many taxa of Neognathae exhibit a quadruple of symmetrically arranged FNH, in others four foramina are strung together in a line. A few taxa show more than four FNH, although in these cases the additional foramina are very small. Of particular interest is the occurrence of a very large caudal FNH in Trochilidae and many species of Passeriformes. This large foramen is suggestive of a correlation with the highly developed vocal capabilities of these birds and may transmit fibers from the tracheosyringeal portion of nucleus nervi hypoglossi, in which case it would be an osteological correlate of vocal capabilities. However, targeted neuroanatomical studies are required to determine how individual hypoglossal foramina relate to hypoglossal roots and their branches, and which of them receive fibers supplying axial, lingual, and syringeal muscles.",

The PADAA is an efficient instrument for catastrophe recovery, yet it remains a mysterious mechanism to many members of disaster management communities. This paper aims to lift the veil on it by assessing its origins and evolution. It draws on the multi-level moderated competition model to explain how the PADAA functions within the Chinese administrative system. The country's top-down political system allows the central authority to mandate provincial and local governments from more economically developed regions to assist devastated areas with post-disaster reconstruction. The practices of local accountability complement vertical control by giving leaders from donor regions strong incentives to accomplish assigned reconstruction tasks, resulting in intense competition between them.",

However, little is known regarding the electromechanical substrate for CRT and whether this is the optimal pacing strategy.This was a pilot prospective double crossover randomized controlled clinical study comparing ventricular back up pacing (VVI-40), RV fusion pacing (DDD-40, RV only), and biventricular (BIV) pacing (DDD-40 BIV) in 9 patients with RBBB and depressed EF. The study compared the frequency of dyssynchrony on baseline echocardiogram in patients with RBBB (n = 4), RBBB + anterior MI, (RBBB with left axis deviation + left ventricular (LV) anterior wall thinning, n = 3) and RBBB + LAFB (RBBB with left axis deviation without LV anterior wall thinning n = 2). Echocardiographic assessment of LV dyssynchrony, LV size, and LV function was repeated after 6 months in each pacing mode.Patients with RBBB + LAFB demonstrated baseline echocardiographic dyssynchrony between the LV anterior and inferior wall. Both DDD-40 RV-only pacing and DDD-40 BIV pacing resulted in improved LV function and clinical status compared to VVI-40 back up pacing. Patients with RBBB alone and RBBB with anterior MI had no baseline dyssynchrony and CRT using either RV only or BIV pacing resulted in LV dilation, worsened LVEF, and worsened clinical status compared to VVI-40 back up pacing.Patients with RBBB, left axis deviation, and no prior anterior MI may have LV dyssynchrony between the anterior and inferior walls that is correctable with CRT.

Specimens were then histologically examined for features of pseudoxanthoma elasticum in the dermis and/or subcutaneous fat, utilizing hematoxylin and eosin staining. Von Kossa and Verhoeff-Van Gieson special stains were also performed to examine calcification and elastic fibers, respectively.We reviewed 13 biopsy specimens from 9 patients with known clinical and histologic evidence of calciphylaxis, both uremic and non-uremic types. Upon reexamination, we found that 46.2% (n=6/13) of the specimens demonstrated concomitant PXE-like changes uniquely localized to the subcutaneous fat.The presence of PXE-like changes in the subcutis may heighten suspicion for a diagnosis of calciphylaxis in the appropriate clinical setting and be helpful when classic histologic features are subtle or absent.",

    "articleAbstract": "There is growing evidence that botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) exhibit biological effects on various human cell types with a host of associated clinical implications. The BoNT receptors and intracellular targets are not unique for neurotransmission. They have been found in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, but there are differences in the way BoNT binds to, and acts on neuronal vs. non-neuronal cells. The non-neuronal cells expressing one or more BoNT/A-binding proteins and/or cleavage target SNAP-25 include epidermal keratinocytes, mesenchymal stem cells from subcutaneous adipose, nasal mucosal cells, urothelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and prostate, breast and alveolar epithelial cells, BoNT/A can also elicit specific biological effects in dermal fibroblasts, sebocytes and vascular endothelial cells. The reported non-traditional applications of BoNT in dermatologic conditions include hyperhidrosis, Hailey-Hailey disease, Darier disease, inversed psoriasis, aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma, pachyonychia congenita, multiple eccrine hydrocystomas, eccrine angiomatous hamartoma, eccrine sweat gland nevi, congenital eccrine nevus, Raynaud phenomenon and cutaneous leiomyomas. Experimental studies demonstrated BoNT/A ability to protect skin flaps, facilitate wound healing, decrease thicknesses of hypertrophic scars, produce an anti-aging effect, and improve a mouse model of psoriasiform dermatitis. Furthermore, experimental studies also have revealed extracutaneous effects of BoNT arising from its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Therefore, it is clear that BoNTs have a much wider zone of influence than originally understood, and that these ubiquitous events are based on individual cellular responses to the cholinergic impacts of BoNTs, which represents fertile grounds for future studies that are highly likely to result in impactful discoveries.

    "articleAbstract": "Mammography screening has increased the detection of early pre-invasive breast cancers, termed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), increasing the urgency of identifying molecular regulators of invasion as prognostic markers to predict local relapse. Using the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model and pharmacological protease inhibitors, we reveal that cysteine cathepsins have important roles in early-stage tumorigenesis. To characterize the cell-specific roles of cathepsins in early invasion, we developed a DCIS-like model, incorporating an immortalized myoepithelial cell line (N1ME) that restrained tumor cell invasion in 3D culture. Using this model, we identified an important myoepithelial-specific function of the cysteine cathepsin inhibitor stefin A in suppressing invasion, whereby targeted stefin A loss in N1ME cells blocked myoepithelial-induced suppression of breast cancer cell invasion. Enhanced invasion observed in 3D cultures with N1ME stefin A-low cells was reliant on cathepsin B activation, as addition of the small molecule inhibitor CA-074 rescued the DCIS-like non-invasive phenotype. Importantly, we confirmed that stefin A was indeed abundant in myoepithelial cells in breast tissue. Use of a 138-patient cohort confirmed that myoepithelial stefin A (cystatin A) is abundant in normal breast ducts and low-grade DCIS but reduced in high-grade DCIS, supporting myoepithelial stefin A as a candidate marker of lower risk of invasive relapse. We have therefore identified myoepithelial cell stefin A as a suppressor of early tumor invasion and a candidate marker to distinguish patients who are at low risk of developing invasive breast cancer, and can therefore be spared further treatment.

    "articleAbstract": "Optimization models of stomatal conductance (gs ) attempt to explain observed stomatal behaviour in terms of cost--benefit tradeoffs. While the benefit of stomatal opening through increased CO2 uptake is clear, currently the nature of the associated cost(s) remains unclear. We explored the hypothesis that gs maximizes leaf photosynthesis, where the cost of stomatal opening arises from nonstomatal reductions in photosynthesis induced by leaf water stress. We analytically solved two cases, CAP and MES, in which reduced leaf water potential leads to reductions in carboxylation capacity (CAP) and mesophyll conductance (gm ) (MES). Both CAP and MES predict the same one-parameter relationship between the intercellular : atmospheric CO2 concentration ratio (ci /ca ) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD, D), viz. ci /ca  ≈ ξ/(ξ + √D), as that obtained from previous optimization models, with the novel feature that the parameter ξ is determined unambiguously as a function of a small number of photosynthetic and hydraulic variables. These include soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance, implying a stomatal closure response to drought. MES also predicts that gs /gm is closely related to ci /ca and is similarly conservative. These results are consistent with observations, give rise to new testable predictions, and offer new insights into the covariation of stomatal, mesophyll and hydraulic conductances.",

    "articleAbstract": "Multiple pregnancy is a strong risk factor for preterm birth, and more than 50% of women with a twin pregnancy will give birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Infants born preterm are recognised to be at increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, contributing to more than half of overall perinatal mortality. Progesterone is produced naturally in the body and has a role in maintaining pregnancy, although it is not clear whether administering progestogens to women with multiple pregnancy at high risk of early birth is effective and safe.To assess the benefits and harms of progesterone administration for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy.We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 November 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.We included randomised controlled trials examining the administration of a progestogen by any route for the prevention of preterm birth in women with multiple pregnancy. We did not include quasi-randomised or cross-over studies.Two review authors independently assessed reports identified by the search for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence.We included 17 trials, which all compared either vaginal or intramuscular (IM) progesterone with a placebo or no treatment, and involved a total of 4773 women. The risk of bias for the majority of included studies was low, with the exception of four studies that had inadequate blinding, or significant loss to follow-up or both, or were not reported well enough for us to make a judgement. We graded the evidence low to high quality, with downgrading for statistical heterogeneity, design limitations in some of the studies contributing data, and imprecision of the effect estimate. 1 IM progesterone versus no treatment or placeboMore women delivered at less than 34 weeks' gestation in the IM progesterone group compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 2.26; women = 399; studies = 2; low-quality evidence). Although the incidence of perinatal death in the progesterone group was higher, there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate and high heterogeneity between studies (average RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.51; infants = 3089; studies = 6; I(2) = 71%; low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up.There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; women = 2010; studies = 5; high-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.55; women = 1920; studies = 5; moderate-quality evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; infants = 4071; studies = 5; I(2) = 76%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. 2 Vaginal progesterone versus no treatment or placebo by doseThere were no clear group differences in incidence of preterm birth before 34 weeks (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.09; women = 1727; studies = 6; I(2) = 46%; low-quality evidence). Although fewer births before 34 weeks appeared to occur in the progesterone group, the CIs crossed the line of no effect. Incidence of perinatal death was higher in the progesterone group, although there was considerable uncertainty in the effect estimate and the quality of the evidence was low for this outcome (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.06; infants = 2287; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up.There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06; women = 1597; studies = 6; moderate-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.21; women = 1569; studies = 4; low-quality evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03; infants = 3079; studies = 4; I(2) = 49%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials.For secondary outcomes, there were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal outcomes except for caesarean section, where women who received vaginal progesterone did not have as many caesarean sections as those in the placebo group, although the difference between groups was not large (7%) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; women = 2143; studies = 6; I(2) = 0%). There were no clear group differences found in any of the infant outcomes except for mechanical ventilation, which was required by fewer infants whose mothers had received the vaginal progesterone (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77; infants = 3134; studies = 5).Overall, for women with a multiple pregnancy, the administration of progesterone (either IM or vaginal) does not appear to be associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth or improved neonatal outcomes.Future research could focus on a comprehensive individual participant data meta-analysis including all of the available data relating to both IM and vaginal progesterone administration in women with a multiple pregnancy, before considering the need to conduct trials in subgroups of high-risk women (for example, women with a multiple pregnancy and a short cervical length identified on ultrasound).",

    "articleAbstract": "Following incomplete compression injury in the thoracic spinal cord of neonatal mice one day after birth (P1), virtually normal hindlimb locomotor function is recovered within about 3 weeks despite substantial permanent thoracic tissue loss (Boulland et al. 2013; Chawla et al. 2016). Here, we asked whether similar recovery occurs following lumbar injury that impacts more directly on the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). As in thoracic injuries, lumbar injuries caused about 90% neuronal loss at the injury site and increased serotonergic innervation below the injury. Motor recovery was slower after lumbar than thoracic injury, but virtually normal function was attained by P25 in both cases. Locomotor CPG status was tested by eliciting fictive locomotion in isolated spinal cords using a widely used neurochemical cocktail (NMDA, dopamine, serotonin). No fictive locomotion could be elicited 1 day post-injury, but could within 3 days post-injury as readily as in age-matched uninjured control spinal cords. Burst patterning and coordination were largely similar in injured and control spinal cords but there were differences. Notably, in both groups there were two main locomotor frequencies, but injured spinal cords exhibited a shift towards the higher frequency. Injury also altered the neurochemical dependence of locomotor CPG output, such that injured spinal cords, unlike control spinal cords, were incapable of generating low frequency rhythmic coordinated activity in the presence of NMDA and dopamine alone. Thus, the neonatal spinal cord exhibits remarkable functional recovery also after lumbar injuries, but the neurochemical sensitivity of locomotor circuitry is modified in the process.

The largest area of confluent three-dimensional power-Doppler signal (Acon ) at the uteroplacental interface was estimated under two bladder volumes differing by at least 200 mL.Acon was calculated for 14 women, of whom seven were subsequently found to have PAS disorders. For these seven women, log(Acon ) was significantly greater when measured with a filled bladder than when measured with an unfilled bladder (P<0.001).Objective evidence was found for a quantifiable difference in vascularity in the myometrium with bladder volume among women with PAS disorders. This difference has sufficient magnitude to influence the potential of Acon as a diagnostic marker. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The women were classified into the benign tumor group or malignant tumor group (borderline and malignant tumors). Serum levels of CA125 and HE4 were extracted from medical records. The two tumor indices were calculated using relevant clinical data.Among 267 included women, 110 had benign tumors, 42 had borderline ovarian tumors, and 115 had malignant tumors. The two indices showed similar discriminatory performance with no significant differences (P>0.05). In the differentiation of benign tumors from all stages of borderline tumor and ovarian cancer, ROMA showed a sensitivity of 71% at a specificity of 88%, whereas CPH-I showed a sensitivity of 69% at a specificity of 85%.CPH-I is a potential tumor index that is independent of menopausal status. It might be applied as a simple alternative to ROMA in settings of basic medical care. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Twenty patients with pre-delivery spinal hypotension were randomly allocated to receive an initial dose of either 50 μg phenylephrine or 7.5 mg ephedrine; the primary outcome was percentage change in cardiac index. After a 300-ml colloid preload, mean (SD) cardiac index increased from 4.9 (1.1) to 5.6 (1.2) l.min(-1) .m(-2) (p < 0.01), resulting from an increase in both heart rate, from 81.3 (17.2) to 86.3 (16.5) beats.min(-1) (p = 0.2), and stroke volume, from 111.8 (19.0) to 119.8 (17.9) ml (p = 0.049). Fourteen (33%) and 23 (54.8%) patients exhibited a stroke volume response > 10% and > 5%, respectively; a significant negative correlation was found between heart rate and stroke volume changes. Spinal hypotension in 20 patients was associated with an increase from baseline in cardiac index of 0.6 l.min(-1) .m(-2) (mean difference 11.5%; p < 0.0001). After a median [range] dose of 50 [50-150] μg phenylephrine or 15 [7.5-37.5] mg ephedrine, the percentage change in cardiac index during the measurement period of 150 s was greater, and negative, in patients receiving phenylephrine vs. ephedrine, at -12.0 (7.3)% vs. 2.6 (6.0)%, respectively (p = 0.0001). The percentage change in heart rate after vasopressor was higher in patients receiving phenylephrine, at -9.1 (3.4)% vs. 5.3 (12.6)% (p = 0.0027), as was the change in systemic vascular resistance, at 22.3 (7.5) vs. -1.9 (10.5)% (p < 0.0001).

    "articleAbstract": "Contact lens (CL) wear is a risk factor for development of microbial keratitis, a vision threatening infection of the eye. Adverse events associated with colonization of lenses, especially by the multi-drug resistant and biofilm forming bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain a major safety issue. Therefore, novel strategies and compounds to reduce the onset of CL-associated ocular infections are needed. Recently, the activity of the frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptide Esc(1-21) and its diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c was evaluated against both planktonic and sessile forms of this pathogen. Furthermore, Esc(1-21) was found to significantly reduce the severity of P. aeruginosa keratitis in a mouse model and preserve antipseudomonal activity in the presence of human basal tears. Here, we have analyzed the activity of the peptides on P. aeruginosa biofilm formed on soft CLs. Microbiological assays and scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that the peptides were able to disrupt the bacterial biofilm, with the diastereomer having the greater efficacy (up to 85% killing vs no killing at 4 μM for some strains). Furthermore, upon covalent immobilization to the CL, the two peptides were found to cause more than four log reduction in the number of bacterial cells within 20 minutes and to reduce bacterial adhesion to the CL surface (77%-97% reduction) in 24 hours. Importantly, peptide immobilization was not toxic to mammalian cells and did not affect the lens characteristics. Overall, our data suggest that both peptides have great potential to be developed as novel pharmaceuticals for prevention and treatment of CL-associated P. aeruginosa keratitis.",

In the current study, we found that extracellular acidification (pH 6.0) inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of articular chondrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, while the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK increased, but, this effect was blocked by the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM and the ASIC1a-specific blocker PcTx-1. In addition, extracellular acidification increased the expression of c-fos, GAG, HYP, and TIM1/2. These effects were inhibited by the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, and ASIC1a-specific blocker PcTx-1, but not the P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Finally, extracellular acidification increased the expression of c-jun and MMP-2/9, and these effects were blocked by the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM, P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and ASIC1a-specific blocker PcTx-1, but not the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. In conclusion, ASIC1a inhibits the expression of MMP-2/9, GAG, HYP, and TIMP-1/2 by the Ca(2+)-dependent P38 MAPK/c-jun and ERK/c-fos signaling pathways.",

    "articleAbstract": "Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a huge socioeconomic burden, and its treatment relies on antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Recently, the melatonergic system that is closely associated with the serotonergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. However, it remains unknown whether combined treatment with SSRI and melatonin has synergistic antidepressant effects. In this study, we applied a sub-chronic restraint stress paradigm, and evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of combined fluoxetine and melatonin in adult male mice. Sub-chronic restraint stress (6 h/day for 10 days) induced depression-like behavior as shown by deteriorated fur state, increased latency to groom in the splash test, and increased immobility time in the forced-swim test. Repeated administration of either fluoxetine or melatonin at 10 mg/kg during stress exposure failed to prevent depression-like phenotypes. However, combined treatment with fluoxetine and melatonin at the selected dose attenuated stress-induced behavioral abnormalities. Moreover, we found that the antidepressant effects of combined treatment were associated with the normalization of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that combined fluoxetine and melatonin treatment exerts synergistic antidepressant effects possibly by restoring hippocampal BDNF-TrkB signaling.",

    "articleAbstract": "Blue corn is a cereal rich in phenolic compounds used to make blue tortillas. Tortillas are an important part of the Mexican diet. Blue corn and tortilla represent an important source of the natural antioxidants anthocyanins. However, studies on their biological activity on cancer cell lines are limited. The goal of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of blue corn and tortilla on different cancer cell lines.Total polyphenol content, monomeric anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity by the DPPH and TBARS methods of blue corn and tortilla were determined. The anthocyanin profile of tortilla was obtained by means of HPLC-ESI-MS. The antiproliferative activity of blue corn and tortilla extract on HepG2, H-460, Hela, MCF-7 and PC-3 was evaluated by the MTT assay.Blue corn had higher content of total polyphenols and monomeric anthocyanins as well as lower percentage of polymeric color than tortilla; however, both showed similar antioxidant activity by DPPH. In addition, although a higher degradation of anthocyanins was observed on tortilla extract, both extracts inhibited lipid peroxidation (IC50) at a similar concentration. The anthocyanin profile showed 28 compounds which are primarily derived from cyanidin, including acylated anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Blue corn and tortilla extracts showed antiproliferative effects against HepG2, H-460, MCF-7 and PC-3 cells at 1000 μg/mL, however Hela cells were more sensitive at this concentration.This is the first report to demonstrate anticancer properties in vitro of tortilla derived from blue corn, suggesting that this product has beneficial health effects. In addition, blue corn could be a potential source of nutraceuticals with anticancer activity.",

    "articleAbstract": "Endocrine therapy is a crucial treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, with proven clinical benefits. However, adaptive mechanisms emerge in the tumor, causing resistance to endocrine therapy. A better understanding of resistance mechanisms is needed to overcome this problem and to develop new, precise treatment strategies. Accumulating genetic and cancer biological studies demonstrate the importance of understanding the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and CDK4/6/RB pathways in ER+ HER2- breast cancer. PIK3CA (which encodes phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α) is frequently mutated in breast cancer, and 30% of advanced ER+ HER2- breast cancers have an activating PIK3CA mutation. AKT1 mutations (E17K) have been found in 1.4-8% of breast cancer patients. ER+ breast cancer patients preferentially demonstrate gain of CCND1 (cyclin D1; 58% in luminal B vs. 29% in luminal A) and CDK4 (25% in luminal B vs. 14% in luminal A) and loss of CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN2C (p18), which are negatively regulated with the cell cycle and are correlated with the CDK4/6/RB pathway. Abnormalities in PI3K/Akt/mTOR and CDK4/6/RB pathways due to genetic alterations result in deregulated kinase activity and malignant transformation. This review focuses on the recent reports of the essential role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and CDK4/6/RB pathways in ER+ HER2- breast cancer.",

A diagnosis of LVAD-related infection was made based on persistent bacteremia associated with moderate 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT uptake in the left ventricular apex. Disk diffusion testing for C/T was performed (MIC 2 μg/mL) and intravenous antibiotic therapy with C/T and amikacin was started, with clinical and microbiological response. Initial conservative management with 6 weeks of systemic antibiotic therapy was attempted, but the patient relapsed one month after antibiotic discontinuation. Priority for transplantation was given and after 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy (C/T + amikacin), LVAD removal and heart transplant were performed, with no infection relapse.We reported the first off-label use of C/T in the management of MDR P. aeruginosa LVAD infection as a bridge to heart transplant. C/T has shown potent anti-pseudomonal activity and good safety profile making this drug as a good candidate for suppressive strategy in intravascular device-associated bloodstream infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa.",

It is known that the variation potential decreases the rate of CO2 assimilation by the Calvin-Benson cycle; however, its influence on light reactions has been poorly investigated. The aim of our work was to investigate the influence of the variation potential on the light energy flow that is absorbed, trapped and dissipated per active reaction centre in photosystem II and on the flow of electrons through the chloroplast electron transport chain. We analysed chlorophyll fluorescence in pea leaves using JIP-test and PAM-fluorometry; we also investigated delayed fluorescence. The electrical signals were registered using extracellular electrodes. We showed that the burning-induced variation potential stimulated a nonphotochemical loss of energy in photosystem II under dark conditions. It was also shown that the variation potential gradually increased the flow of light energy absorbed, trapped and dissipated by photosystem II. These changes were likely caused by an increase in the fraction of absorbed light distributed to photosystem II. In addition, the variation potential induced a transient increase in electron flow through the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Some probable mechanisms for the influence of the variation potential on the light reactions of photosynthesis (including the potential role of intracellular pH decrease) are discussed in the work.",

Geometric means and tests for trend were calculated using multivariable general linear models.Early age at menarche was associated with higher premenopausal early-follicular free estradiol (percent difference < 12 vs. > 13 years = 11%), early-follicular estrone (7%), luteal estrone (7%), and free testosterone (8%) (all p trend < 0.05). Short menstrual cycle length at age 18-22 was associated with higher early-follicular total (< 26 vs. > 39 days = 18%) and free estradiol (16%), early-follicular estrone (9%), SHBG (7%), lower luteal free estradiol (- 14%), total (- 6%), and free testosterone (- 15%) (all p trend < 0.05). Short adult menstrual length was associated with higher early-follicular total estradiol (< 26 vs. > 31 days = 14%), SHBG (10%), lower luteal estrone (- 8%), progesterone (- 9%), total (- 11%) and free testosterone (- 25%), and androstenedione (- 14%) (all p trend < 0.05). Irregularity of menses at 18-22 was associated with lower early-follicular total (irregular vs. very regular = - 14%) and free estradiol (- 14%), and early-follicular estrone (- 8%) (All p trend < 0.05). Irregularity of adult menstrual cycle was associated with lower luteal total estradiol (irregular vs. very regular = - 8%), SHBG (- 3%), higher total (8%), and free testosterone (11%) (all p trend < 0.05).Early-life and adulthood menstrual characteristics are moderately associated with mid-to-late reproductive year's hormone concentrations. These relations of menstrual characteristics with endogenous hormone levels could partially account for associations between menstrual characteristics and reproductive cancers or other chronic diseases.",

    "articleAbstract": "The aim of this national survey was to record the use of nitrous oxide and the perceptions of French dental practitioners to this form of sedation. The use of nitrous oxide sedation (NOS) has been authorised in private dental practice in France since December 2009 but, to date, no study implementing both quantitative and qualitative methods has explored such use.The data were collected using a Google Forms questionnaire. A mixed methodology was used for data analysis: a quantitative approach to explore the use of conscious sedation and a qualitative thematic approach (using Nvivo software) to determine the practitioner's perception of it.Responses were collected from 225 practitioners (19% of the target population of 1185). Most of the responders were trained in NOS use in private dental clinics. Seventy-three percent of those who trained privately actually used NOS, compared to 53% of those trained at university (p-value = 0.0052). Above all, NOS was used for children requiring restorative dentistry. The average price of the sedation was 50 Euros and it lasted, on average, for 37 min. The qualitative and thematic analysis revealed the financial and technical difficulties of implementing NOS in private practice. However, it also showed the benefits and pleasure associated with NOS use.This statistical survey of French dental practitioners offers an insight of the current state of the use of conscious sedation with nitrous oxide in private general dental practice in France. It also includes the first report of dental practitioners' perceptions of NOS use and may lead to a better understanding of the reasons why sedation is sometimes not used in private practice.",

    "articleAbstract": "West syndrome (WS), also known as infantile spasms, occurs in infancy with a peak between 4 and 7 months. Spasms, neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalogram (EEG) basically define WS. The International League Against Epilepsy commission classifies the aetiologies of WS into genetic, structural, metabolic and unknown. Early diagnosis and a shorter lag time to treatment are essential for the overall outcome of WS patients. These goals are feasible with the addition of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic and metabolic testing. The present work analysed the medical literature on WS and reports the principal therapeutic protocols of its management. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), vigabatrin (VGB) and corticosteroids are the first-line treatments for WS. There is no unique therapeutic protocol for ACTH, but most of the evidence suggests that low doses are as effective as high doses for short-term treatment, which is generally 2 weeks followed by dose tapering. VGB is generally administered at doses from 50 to 150 mg/kg/day, but its related retinal toxicity, which occurs in 21-34% of infants, is most frequently observed when treatment periods last longer than 6 months. Among corticosteroids, a treatment of 14 days of oral prednisolone (40-60 mg/day) has been considered effective and well tolerated. Considering that an early diagnosis and a shorter lag time to treatment are essential for successful outcomes in these patients, further studies on efficacy of the different therapeutic approaches with evaluation of final outcome after cessation of therapy are needed.",

    "articleAbstract": "Macaques possess a repertoire of extractive foraging techniques that range from complex manipulation to tool-aided behaviors, to access food items that increase their foraging efficiency substantially. However, the complexity and composition of such techniques vary considerably between species and even between populations. In the present study, we report seven such complex manipulative behaviors that include six extractive foraging behaviors, and teeth flossing, in a population of Nicobar long-tailed macaques. The apparent purpose of these behaviors was an extraction of encased food, processing food, foraging hidden invertebrates, and dental flossing. Among these behaviors, three behaviors viz. wrapping, wiping, and teeth-flossing were tool-aided behaviors, where macaques used both natural and synthetic materials as tools. Occasionally macaques also modified those tools prior to their use. The substrate use patterns of leaf rubbing and teeth flossing were similar to that observed in other macaques. The spontaneous tool modification to perform wrapping was a first time observation. These observations suggest that Nicobar long-tailed macaques have a high level of sensorimotor intelligence which helps to evolve such innovative foraging solutions.",

This study was aimed to determine the CIB2 and GJB2 variants and associated phenotype in 150 non-familial individuals with HL. After getting informed consent, 150 non-familial deaf patients were enrolled and blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction. Pure tone air conduction audiometry was performed. Coding exons of CIB2 and GJB2 genes were Sanger sequenced. A tetra primer ARMS assay was developed for recurrent CIB2 variant. Four bi-allelic GJB2 variants, c.71G>A p.(Trp24*), c.231G>A p.(Trp77*), c.235delC p.(Leu79Cysfs3*) and c.35delG p.(Gly11Leufs24*), were found in nine hearing impaired individuals. We also found four homozygotes and five carriers of c.380G>A p. (Arg127His) variant of controversial clinical significance. CIB2 sequencing revealed single recurrent variant c.272T>C p. (Phe91Ser) segregating with HL in ten individuals. Among our patients, c.71G>A (p.Trp24*) was the most common variant, accounted for 45% of GJB2 variants. Two known GJB2 variants, c.235delC p. (Leu79Cysfs3*) and c.310del14 p. (Lys105Argfs2*), are reported here for the first time in Pakistani population. Our data further support the benign nature of c.380G>A p. (Arg127His) variant. For CIB2, c.272T>C p. (Phe91Ser) is the second common cause of HL among our sporadic cases. Phenotypically, in our patients, individuals homozygous for GJB2 variants had profound HL, whereas CIB2 homozygotes had severe to profound prelingual HL. Our results suggest that GJB2 and CIB2 are common cause of HL in different Pakistani ethnicities.",

    "articleAbstract": "Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, and its efficacy has been confirmed in several clinical trials, although no clinically useful biomarkers have been identified. In other cancers, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) are associated with chemotherapy response and prognosis. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the associations of pazopanib response with NLR, PLR, and LMR among patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.Data regarding NLR, PLR, and LMR were obtained for 25 patients who received pazopanib for soft-tissue sarcoma. The patients were categorized according to their values for NLR (≥3.8 vs. <3.8), PLR (≥230 vs. <230), and LMR (≥2.4 vs. <2.4), and we evaluated the associations of these markers with progression-free survival and overall survival using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional models.No significant differences in progression-free survival or overall survival were observed based on the pre-treatment NLR, PLR, and LMR values. However, decreased NLR values after treatment using pazopanib were independently associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.07, p = 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.17, p = 0.0006).Decreased NLR values after treatment using pazopanib may predict high efficacy and favorable outcomes among patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.",

We sought to assess the diagnoses most frequently associated with admissions for PCE, and to determine if certain conditions were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and rates of readmission. Nationally distributed data from 44 pediatric hospitals in the 2004-2015 Pediatric Health Information System database were used to identify patients with hospital admissions for International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for PCE and/or cardiac tamponade. Children with congenital heart disease were excluded. ICD-9 codes for conditions associated with PCE were grouped into eight categories: neoplastic, renal, autoimmune/inflammatory, pneumonia, viral, bacterial, hypothyroidism, and idiopathic. Multivariable models were used to evaluate odds of in-hospital mortality and readmission within 30 and 90 days. There were 9902 patients who met inclusion criteria. Total in-hospital mortality was 8.2% (n = 813); of those without a neoplastic diagnosis, mortality was 6.5% (n = 493/7543). Idiopathic PCE accounted for the most admissions (36%), followed by neoplasms (24%), pneumonia (20%), and autoimmune/inflammatory disease (19%). In multivariable models, odds of death were highest for neoplasms (adjusted odds ratio 3.83, p < 0.001) and renal disease (adjusted odds ratio 2.86, p < 0.001). Children with a neoplasm, renal disease, and those undergoing pericardiocentesis had the highest rates of readmission at 30 and 90 days. Children admitted with non-postoperative PCE have multiple associated conditions. Neoplasm and renal disease in the setting of PCE are associated with the highest odds of in-hospital mortality among concomitant conditions; children with a neoplasm, renal disease, and those undergoing pericardiocentesis have the highest odds of readmission.",

In most studies, methodological quality was low. It is likely that an inclusion bias exists, many studies only included exceptional speakers. Significant better outcomes are reported for TES compared to ES for the acoustic parameters, fundamental frequency, maximum phonation time and intensity. Perceptually, TES is rated with a significant better voice quality and intelligibility than ES and ELS. None of the speech rehabilitation groups reported clearly better outcomes in patient-reported outcomes.Studies on speech outcomes after TL are flawed in design and represent weak levels of evidence. There is an urge for standardized measurement tools for evaluations of substitute voice speakers. TES is the favorable speech rehabilitation method according to acoustic and perceptual outcomes. All speaker groups after TL report a degree of voice handicap. Knowledge of caretakers and differences in health care and insurance systems play a role in the speech rehabilitation options that can be offered.",

Over this period, the SLE ASMR decreased less than the non-SLE ASMR, with a 34.6% cumulative increase in the ratio of the former to the latter. The non-SLE ASMR decreased every year starting in 1968, whereas the SLE ASMR decreased between 1968 and 1975, increased between 1975 and 1999, and decreased thereafter. Similar patterns were seen in both sexes, among black persons, and in the South. However, statistically significant increases in the SLE ASMR did not occur among white persons over the 46-year period. Females, black persons, and residents of the South had higher SLE ASMRs and larger cumulative increases in the ratio of the SLE to the non-SLE ASMR (31.4%, 62.5%, and 58.6%, respectively) than males, other racial/ethnic groups, and residents of other regions, respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed independent associations of sex, race, and region with SLE mortality risk and revealed significant racial/ethnic differences in associations of SLE mortality with sex and region.Underreporting of SLE on death certificates may have resulted in underestimates of SLE ASMRs. Accuracy of coding on death certificates is difficult to ascertain.Rates of SLE mortality have decreased since 1968 but remain high relative to non-SLE mortality, and significant sex, racial, and regional disparities persist.None.",

Two subsets of the patient group answered the questions during a 2nd week after voice therapy (29 patients) or laryngeal surgery (16 patients).High reliability resulted for patients (Cronbach's α = .88) and controls (α = .95). Patients reported higher D-SHP, discomfort, and fatigue (Cohen's d = 1.62-1.92) compared with controls. Patients posttherapy and postsurgery reported significantly improved self-ratings of vocal status relative to their pretreatment ratings (d = 0.70-1.13). Within-subject changes in self-ratings greater than 20 points were considered clinically meaningful.Ratings of D-SHP, discomfort, and fatigue have adequate reliability and validity for tracking vocal status throughout daily life in patients with VH and vocally healthy individuals. These questions could help investigate the relationship between vocal symptom variability and putative contributing factors (e.g., voice use/rest, emotions).",

However, there is limited information on the effective ways to teach speech-language pathology graduate students to acquire these skills. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of performance feedback on graduate students' use of ethnographic principles, open-ended questions, and restating and summarizing comments in caregiver interviews.A randomized controlled crossover design (n = 26) was used to examine the differential effects of students receiving performance feedback or general feedback on role-play interviews. Ethnographic principles, open-ended questions, and restating and summarizing comments were measured at 3 time points: after class instruction (Groups 1 and 2), after the first feedback type allocation (Group 1: performance feedback; Group 2: general feedback), and after the second feedback type allocation (Group 1: general feedback; Group 2: performance feedback).Statistically significant increases, with large effect sizes, were found in students' use of ethnographic principles, open-ended questions, and restating and summarizing comments following the performance feedback conditions.These findings suggest that performance feedback is an effective and efficient instructional procedure to increase culturally responsive and family-centered interview skills through an ethnographic interview approach in preservice speech-language pathology students.",

    "articleAbstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in expanding the research approaches that speech-language pathologists utilize, particularly for addressing complex questions. Consensus-building techniques can be useful for addressing such questions. The Delphi technique is a consensus-building process involving structured communication among members of an expert panel via independent responses to iterative rounds of questionnaires. The purpose of this research note is to describe and demonstrate the Delphi technique using an application to a complex problem in speech-language pathology, that is, the bases of social communication and pragmatics.The Delphi technique was described and illustrated via the following study: 10 expert speech-language pathologists participated in a 3-round Delphi study. Participants were asked to list the key features of social communication and pragmatics in Round 1. Questions for Rounds 2 and 3 were developed on the basis of the participants' responses to previous rounds.The Delphi technique was useful in bringing participants to consensus on the key features of social communication and pragmatics and offered a starting point for the continued exploration of this complex problem.A discussion of the benefits and limitations of the technique is included, highlighting the utility of the technique to the field of speech-language pathology.",

    "articleAbstract": "Early auditory experiences are fundamental in infant language acquisition. Research consistently demonstrates the benefits of early intervention (i.e., hearing aids) to language outcomes in children who are deaf and hard of hearing. The nature of these benefits and their relation with prefitting development are, however, not well understood.This study examined Ontario Infant Hearing Program birth cohorts to explore predictors of performance on the Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition at the time of (N = 47) and after (N = 19) initial hearing aid intervention.Regression analyses revealed that, before the hearing aid fitting, severity of hearing loss negatively predicted 19% and 10% of the variance in auditory comprehension and expressive communication, respectively. After hearing aid fitting, children's standard scores on language measures remained stable, but they made significant improvement in their progress values, which represent individual skills acquired on the test, rather than standing relative to same-age peers. Magnitude of change in progress values was predicted by a negative interaction of prefitting language ability and severity of hearing loss for the Auditory Comprehension scale.These findings highlight the importance of considering a child's prefitting language ability in interpreting eventual language outcomes. Possible mechanisms of hearing aid benefit are discussed.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.5538868.",

This study tested potential group differences in 2D:4D digit ratios in a sample of boys with and without developmental language disorder (DLD) and examined the strength of associations between 2D:4D digit ratio and a battery of verbal and nonverbal measures.A group of 29 boys affected by DLD and a group of 76 boys with typical language abilities participated (age range = 5;6-11;0 years). Scanned images were used to measure finger lengths. Language measures included the core language subtests from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition (Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 2003), a nonword repetition task, a sentence recall task, and the Test of Early Grammatical Impairment (Rice & Wexler, 2001).Significant group differences indicated lower 2D:4D digit ratios in the group with DLD. Modest associations were found between 2D:4D digit ratios and some Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition subtests.Prenatal hormone exposures may play a role in the etiology of some language symptoms.",

We describe a class of viscoelastic, porous, ion-conductive, and self-powered hydrogels that are fabricated based on a PHEMA hydrogel (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) and PPy (polypyrrole). They are capable of creating synchronous ionic current in electrolyte solution when enduring mechanical deformation. The conditions that impact the electric response of the hydrogel, such as stress, strain rate, pH of electrolyte solution, and concentration of ions in the electrolyte solution, have been investigated and reported in this paper. The mechanism of creating ionic current under deformation is elaborated through numerical simulation and experimental tests. Moreover, by embedding the electrically self-powered hydrogel into a movable object, such as a sports shoe, the patterns of mechanical actions (e.g. walking, running, or jumping) can be identified from the generated electrical current without any assistance of external batteries or power sources. It presents the outstanding potential of this hydrogel in building self-powered soft devices including active sensors and artificial skins.",

    "articleAbstract": "Brine-mica interfacial interactions affect both the caprock integrity and the fate and transport of reactive fluids at deep subsurface sites. Phosphate naturally exists at low concentration in subsurface brines, and its concentration can be increased significantly during energy-related engineered subsurface processes. However, our understanding of the influence of phosphate on brine-mica interactions is limited, especially under subsurface conditions. Here, biotite dissolution experiments were conducted without and with phosphate (0.1, 1, and 10 mM) at 95 °C and 102 atm CO2. Compared to the control, 0.1 mM, and 1 mM phosphate systems, biotite dissolution was four times higher with 10 mM phosphate. Despite the dissolution differences, in all the phosphate systems, phosphate interacted with Al and Fe sites in biotite, forming surface complexation and precipitating as Fe- or Al-bearing minerals on surfaces and in solutions. Consequently, aqueous Fe and Al concentrations became lower with phosphate than in the control experiments. In addition, the biotite basal surfaces became more hydrophilic after reaction with phosphate, even at 0.1 mM, mainly from phosphate adsorption. This study offers new information on how phosphate-containing brine interacts with caprocks and on the consequent wettability changes, results that can benefit current and future energy-related subsurface engineering processes.",

    "articleAbstract": "Optical control of memristors opens the route to new applications in optoelectronic switching and neuromorphic computing. Motivated by the need for reversible and latched optical switching we report on the development of a memristor with electronic properties tunable and switchable by wavelength and polarization specific light. The device consists of an optically active azobenzene polymer, poly(disperse red 1 acrylate), overlaying a forest of vertically aligned ZnO nanorods. Illumination induces trans-cis isomerization of the azobenzene molecules, which expands or contracts the polymer layer and alters the resistance of the off/on states, their ratio and retention time. The reversible optical effect enables dynamic control of a memristor's learning properties including control of synaptic potentiation and depression, optical switching between short-term and long-term memory and optical modulation of the synaptic efficacy via spike timing dependent plasticity. The work opens the route to the dynamic patterning of memristor networks both spatially and temporally by light, thus allowing the development of new optically reconfigurable neural networks and adaptive electronic circuits.",

    "articleAbstract": "Recently Fakhraai and coworkers measured surface diffusion in ultrastable glass produced by vapor deposition, ordinary glass with and without physical aging, and ultrathin films of the same molecular glass-former, N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (TPD). Diffusion on the surfaces of all these glasses is greatly enhanced compared with the bulk diffusion similar to that previously found by others, but remarkably the surface diffusion coefficients DS measured are practically the same. The observed independence of DS from changes of structural α-relaxation due to densification or finite-size effect has an impact on the current understanding of the physical origin of enhanced surface diffusion. We have demonstrated before and also here that the primitive relaxation time τ0 of the coupling model, or its analogue τβ, the Johari-Goldstein β-relaxation, can explain quantitatively the enhancement found in ordinary glasses. In this paper, we assemble together considerable experimental evidence to show that the changes in τβ and τ0 of ultrastable glasses, aged ordinary glasses, and ultrathin-films are all insignificant when compared with ordinary glasses. Thus, in the context of the explanation of the enhanced surface diffusion given by the coupling model, these collective experimental facts on τβ and τ0 further explain approximately the same DS in the different glasses of TPD as found by Fakhraai and coworkers.",

    "articleAbstract": "Lithium cathode materials have been considered as promising candidates for energy storage applications because of their high power/energy densities, low cost, and low toxicity. However, the Li/Ni cation mixing limits their application as practical electrode materials. The cation mixing of lithium transition-metal oxides, which was first considered only as the origin of performance degeneration, has recently been reconsidered as a way to stabilize the structure of active materials. Here we find that as the duration of the post-synthesis thermal treatment (at 500 °C) of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM) was increased, the Li/Ni molar ratio in the final product was found to decrease, and this was attributed to the reduction in nickel occupying lithium sites; the cation mixing subtly changed; and those subtle variations remarkably influence their cycling performance. The cathode material with appropriate cation mixing exhibits a much slower voltage decay and capacity fade during long-term cycling. Combining X-ray diffraction, Rietveld analysis, the Fourier transform infrared technique, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical measurements, we demonstrate that an optimal degree of Ni(2+) occupancy in the lithium layer enhances the electrochemical performance of layered NMC materials and that this occurs through a \"pillaring\" effect. The results provide new insights into \"cation mixing\" as a new concept for material design utilization of layered cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, thereby promoting their further application in lithium-ion batteries with new functions and properties.",

    "articleAbstract": "The progress of dealloying, an electrochemical synthesis method capable of producing nanoporous structures with bulk outer dimensions, is studied by in situ resistometry. The resistance increases by three orders of magnitude while nanoporous gold or platinum is formed. Simultaneous monitoring of charge flow and electrical resistance increase proves to be an ideal combination for analyzing the etching progress, which in accordance with recent studies can be demonstrated to occur in two steps referred to as 'primary (or bulk) dealloying' and 'secondary (or ligament) dealloying'. A model is developed, which describes the resistance increase during etching as governed by the reduction of the master alloy backbone in favor of the nanoporous structure. This new approach allows an evaluation of the etching front propagation (primary dealloying) as well as the status of the already porous structure (secondary dealloying).",

    "articleAbstract": "We fabricated a suite of polymeric electrospun nanofiber mats (ENMs) and investigated their performance as next-generation passive sampler media for environmental monitoring of organic compounds. Electrospinning of common polymers [e.g., polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polystyrene (PS), among others] yielded ENMs with reproducible control of nanofiber diameters (from 50 to 340 nm). The ENM performance was investigated initially with model hydrophilic (aniline and nitrobenzene) and hydrophobic (selected PCB congeners and dioxin) compounds, generally revealing fast chemical uptake into all of these ENMs, which was well described by a one compartment, first-order kinetic model. Typical times to reach 90% equilibrium (t90%) were ≤7 days under mixing conditions for all the ENMs and <0.5 days for the best performing materials under static (i.e., no mixing) conditions. Collectively, these short equilibrium timescales suggest that ENMs may be used in the field as an equilibrium-passive sampler, at least for our model compounds. Equilibrium partitioning coefficients (KENM-W, L kg(-1)) averaged 2 and 4.7 log units for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic analytes, respectively. PAN, PMMA and PS were prioritized for additional studies because they exhibited not only the greatest capacity for simultaneous uptake of the entire model suite (log KENM-W ∼1.5-6.2), but also fast uptake. For these optimized ENMs, the rates of uptake into PAN and PMMA were limited by aqueous phase diffusion to the nanofiber surface, and the rate-determining step for PS was analyte specific. Sorption isotherms also revealed that the environmental application of these optimized ENMs would occur within the linear uptake regime. We examined the ENM performance for the measurement of pore water concentrations from spiked soil and freshwater sediments. Soil and sediment studies not only yielded reproducible pore water concentrations and comparable values to other passive sampler materials, but also provided practical insights into ENM stability and fouling in such systems. Furthermore, fast uptake for a suite of structurally diverse hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds was obtained for PAN and PS, with t90% ranging from 0.01 to 4 days with mixing and KENM-W values ranging from 1.3 to 3.2 log units. Our findings show promise for the development and use of ENMs as equilibrium-passive samplers for a range of organic pollutants across soil/sediment and water systems.",

However, improving the HER performance of electrocatalysts in alkaline media is still challenging. Herein, we report the development of a nickel hydroxide-cobalt disulfide nanowire array on a carbon cloth (Ni(OH)2-CoS2/CC) as a hybrid catalyst to significantly enhance the HER activity in alkaline solutions. Benefitting from heterogeneous interfaces in this 3D hybrid electrocatalyst, Ni(OH)2-CoS2/CC shows superior HER activity with only 99 mV overpotential to drive a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is 100 mV less than that of CoS2/CC. Moreover, Ni(OH)2-CoS2/CC exhibits long-term electrochemical durability with the maintenance of its catalytic activity for 30 h. Density functional theory calculations are performed to gain further insight into the effect of Ni(OH)2-CoS2 interfaces, revealing that Ni(OH)2 plays a key role in water dissociation to hydrogen intermediates and CoS2 facilitates the adsorption of hydrogen intermediates and H2 generation. This work not only develops a promising electrocatalyst for the alkaline HER, but also paves a way to enhance the alkaline HER activity of CoS2via the interface engineering strategy.",

Such modifications usually require extremely high temperature or high-energy irradiation, and are usually a destructive and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a method for engineering a molecular structure of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and their network properties by femtosecond laser irradiation. This method allows effective coalescence between SWNTs, transforming them into other allotropic nanocarbon structures (double-walled, triple-walled and multi-walled nanotubes) with the formation of linear carbon chains. The nanocarbon network created by this laser-induced transformation process shows extraordinarily strong coalescence induced mode in Raman spectra and two-times enhanced electrical conductivity. This work suggests a powerful method for engineering sp(2) carbon allotropes and their junctions, which provides possibilities for next generation materials with structural hybridization at the atomic scale.",

    "articleAbstract": "The discovery of dipole-induced exchange bias (EB), switching from negative to positive sign, is reported in systems where the antiferromagnet and the ferromagnet are separated by a paramagnetic spacer (AFM-PM-FM). The magnitude and sign of the EB is determined by the cooling field strength and the PM thickness. The same cooling field yields negative EB for thin spacers, and positive EB for thicker ones. The EB decay profile as a function of the spacer thickness, and the change of sign, are attributed to long-ranged dipole coupling. Our model, which accounts quantitatively for the experimental results, ignores the short range interfacial exchange interactions of the usual EB theories. Instead, it retains solely the long range dipole field that allows for the coupling of the FM and AFM across the PM spacer. The experiments allow for novel switching capabilities of long range EB systems, while the theory allows description of the structures where the FM and AFM are not in atomic contact. The results provide a new approach to design novel interacting heterostructures.",

    "articleAbstract": "An experimental-computational methodology combining rotational data, high-level ab initio calculations and predicate least-squares fitting is applied to the axial-equatorial isomerism and semiexperimental equilibrium structure determination of fluorocyclohexane. New supersonic-jet microwave measurements of the rotational spectra of the two molecular conformations, together with all (13)C isotopologues of both isomeric forms are reported. Equilibrium rotational constants are obtained from the ground-state rotational constants corrected for vibration-rotation interactions and electronic contributions. Equilibrium structures were determined by the mixed estimation (ME) method. Different computational methods were tested for the evaluation of predicate values of the structural parameters, and a computationally effective procedure for estimating reliable dihedral angles is proposed. Structural parameters were fitted concurrently to predicate parameters and moments of inertia, affected with appropriate uncertainties. The new structures of the title compound are regarded as accurate to 0.001 Å and 0.2°, illustrating the advantages of this methodology. Structural comparisons are offered with the cyclohexane prototype, revealing subtle substituent effects. For comparison purposes the equilibrium structures for the two fluorocyclohexane isomers and cyclohexanone are computed from high-level ab initio theory with inclusion of adjustments for basis set dependence and correlation of the core electrons.",
