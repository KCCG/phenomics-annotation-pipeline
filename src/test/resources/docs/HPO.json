PIDs have a broad phenotype with increased morbidity and mortality and treatment choices are often complex. With increased accessibility of next-generation sequencing the rate of discovery of genetic causes for PID has increased exponentially. Identification of an underlying monogenic diagnosis provides important clinical benefits for patients with the potential to alter treatments, facilitate genetic counselling, and pre-implantation diagnostics. We investigated a next-generation sequencing PID panel of 242 genes within clinical care across a range of PID phenotypes. We also evaluated Phenomizer to predict causal genes from human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms. 27 participants were recruited and a total of 15 reportable variants were identified in 48% (13/27) of the participants. The panel results had implications for treatment in 37% (10/27) of participants. Phenomizer identified the genes harbouring variants from HPO terms in 33% (9/27) of participants. This study demonstrates the clinical efficacy that genetic testing has in the care of PID. However, it also highlights some of the disadvantages of gene panels in the rapidly moving field of PID genomics and current challenges in HPO term assignment for PID.","PMID":29077208,"authors":[{"lastName":"Rae","initials":"W","foreName":"W"},{"lastName":"Ward","initials":"D","foreName":"D"},{"lastName":"Mattocks","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Pengelly","initials":"RJ","foreName":"R J"},{"lastName":"Eren","initials":"E","foreName":"E"},{"lastName":"Patel","initials":"SV","foreName":"S V"},{"lastName":"Faust","initials":"SN","foreName":"S N"},{"lastName":"Hunt","initials":"D","foreName":"D"},{"lastName":"Williams","initials":"AP","foreName":"A P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17466,"articleTitle":"Fluorescent \"Turn-Off\" Detection of Fluoride and Cyanide Ions Using Zwitterionic Spirocyclic Meisenheimer Compounds.","dateCreated":"2017-10-27","dateRevised":"2017-10-27","publication":{"issnNumber":"1420-3049","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","isoAbbreviation":"Molecules"},"articleDate":"2017-10-27","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Stable zwitterionic spirocyclic Meisenheimer compounds were synthesized using a one-step reaction between picric acid and diisopropyl (ZW1) or dicyclohexyl (ZW3) carbodiimide.

In the first article, the authors provide a curated and standardized version of the publicly available US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Such a resource will improve the quality of the underlying data, and enable standardized analyses using common vocabularies. The second article describes a project developed in order to facilitate heterogeneous data integration in the i2b2 framework. The originality is to allow users integrate the data described in different terminologies and to build a new repository, with a unique model able to support the representation of the various data. The third paper is dedicated to model the association between multiple phenotypic traits described within the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and the corresponding genotype in the specific context of rare diseases (rare variants). Finally, the fourth paper presents solutions to annotation-ontology mapping in genome-scale data. Of particular interest in this work is the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) and its generic association model, the Ontology of Biomedical AssociatioN (OBAN).

The receptive field for each sensory neuron is defined by its dendritic arbor, but the mechanisms that shape dendritic architecture are incompletely understood. Using the model nociceptor, the PVD neuron in C. elegans, we determined that two types of PVD lateral branches project along the dorsal/ventral axis to generate the PVD dendritic arbor: (1) Pioneer dendrites that adhere to the epidermis, and (2) Commissural dendrites that fasciculate with circumferential motor neuron processes. Previous reports have shown that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor MEC-3 is required for all higher order PVD branching and that one of its targets, the claudin-like membrane protein HPO-30, preferentially promotes outgrowth of pioneer branches. Here, we show that another MEC-3 target, the conserved TFIIA-like zinc finger transcription factor EGL-46, adopts the alternative role of specifying commissural dendrites. The known EGL-46 binding partner, the TEAD transcription factor EGL-44, is also required for PVD commissural branch outgrowth. Double mutants of hpo-30 and egl-44 show strong enhancement of the lateral branching defect with decreased numbers of both pioneer and commissural dendrites. Thus, HPO-30/Claudin and EGL-46/EGL-44 function downstream of MEC-3 and in parallel acting pathways to direct outgrowth of two distinct classes of PVD dendritic branches.","PMID":29031632,"authors":[{"lastName":"O'Brien","initials":"BMJ","foreName":"Barbara M J"},{"lastName":"Palumbos","initials":"SD","foreName":"Sierra D"},{"lastName":"Novakovic","initials":"M","foreName":"Michaela"},{"lastName":"Shang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xueying"},{"lastName":"Sundararajan","initials":"L","foreName":"Lakshmi"},{"lastName":"Miller","initials":"DM","foreName":"David M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17452,"articleTitle":"Prediction of Human Phenotype Ontology terms by means of hierarchical ensemble methods.","dateCreated":"2017-10-13","dateRevised":"2017-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1471-2105","issnType":"Electronic","title":"BMC bioinformatics","isoAbbreviation":"BMC Bioinformatics"},"articleDate":"2017-10-12","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The prediction of human gene-abnormal phenotype associations is a fundamental step toward the discovery of novel genes associated with human disorders, especially when no genes are known to be associated with a specific disease. In this context the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standard categorization of the abnormalities associated with human diseases. While the problem of the prediction of gene-disease associations has been widely investigated, the related problem of gene-phenotypic feature (i.e., HPO term) associations has been largely overlooked, even if for most human genes no HPO term associations are known and despite the increasing application of the HPO to relevant medical problems. Moreover most of the methods proposed in literature are not able to capture the hierarchical relationships between HPO terms, thus resulting in inconsistent and relatively inaccurate predictions.We present two hierarchical ensemble methods that we formally prove to provide biologically consistent predictions according to the hierarchical structure of the HPO. The modular structure of the proposed methods, that consists in a \"flat\" learning first step and a hierarchical combination of the predictions in the second step, allows the predictions of virtually any flat learning method to be enhanced. The experimental results show that hierarchical ensemble methods are able to predict novel associations between genes and abnormal phenotypes with results that are competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms and with a significant reduction of the computational complexity.Hierarchical ensembles are efficient computational methods that guarantee biologically meaningful predictions that obey the true path rule, and can be used as a tool to improve and make consistent the HPO terms predictions starting from virtually any flat learning method. The implementation of the proposed methods is available as an R package from the CRAN repository.","PMID":29025394,"authors":[{"lastName":"Notaro","initials":"M","foreName":"Marco"},{"lastName":"Schubach","initials":"M","foreName":"Max"},{"lastName":"Robinson","initials":"PN","foreName":"Peter N"},{"lastName":"Valentini","initials":"G","foreName":"Giorgio"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17450,"articleTitle":"A new synonym-substitution method to enrich the human phenotype ontology.","dateCreated":"2017-10-11","dateRevised":"2017-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1471-2105","issnType":"Electronic","title":"BMC bioinformatics","isoAbbreviation":"BMC Bioinformatics"},"articleDate":"2017-10-10","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Named entity recognition is critical for biomedical text mining, where it is not unusual to find entities labeled by a wide range of different terms. Nowadays, ontologies are one of the crucial enabling technologies in bioinformatics, providing resources for improved natural language processing tasks. However, biomedical ontology-based named entity recognition continues to be a major research problem.This paper presents an automated synonym-substitution method to enrich the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) with new synonyms. The approach is mainly based on both the lexical properties of the terms and the hierarchical structure of the ontology. By scanning the lexical difference between a term and its descendant terms, the method can learn new names and modifiers in order to generate synonyms for the descendant terms. By searching for the exact phrases in MEDLINE, the method can automatically rule out illogical candidate synonyms. In total, 745 new terms were identified. These terms were indirectly evaluated through the concept annotations on a gold standard corpus and also by document retrieval on a collection of abstracts on hereditary diseases. A moderate improvement in the F-measure performance on the gold standard corpus was observed. Additionally, 6% more abstracts on hereditary diseases were retrieved, and this percentage was 33% higher if only the highly informative concepts were considered.A synonym-substitution procedure that leverages the HPO hierarchical structure works well for a reliable and automatic extension of the terminology. The results show that the generated synonyms have a positive impact on concept recognition, mainly those synonyms corresponding to highly informative HPO terms.","PMID":29017443,"authors":[{"lastName":"Taboada","initials":"M","foreName":"Maria"},{"lastName":"Rodriguez","initials":"H","foreName":"Hadriana"},{"lastName":"Gudivada","initials":"RC","foreName":"Ranga C"},{"lastName":"Martinez","initials":"D","foreName":"Diego"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17449,"articleTitle":"Secretome from hypoxia-conditioned adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells promotes the healing of gastric mucosal injury in a rodent model.","dateCreated":"2017-10-10","dateRevised":"2017-11-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"0006-3002","issnType":"Print","title":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","isoAbbreviation":"Biochim.

Our previous study showed that transplantation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) enhanced the healing of sutured gastric perforation. This study aimed to investigate the paracrine role of ADMSCs in the experimental gastric mucosal injury. Normoxia-conditioned medium (Nor CM) and hypoxia (HPO) CM were obtained after culturing ADMSCs in 20% O2 and 5% O2 for 48h. Cell migration, proliferation, viability, and angiogenesis in vitro were significantly enhanced upon incubation with CM, especially the HPO CM. Experiments in vivo using a rodent model of gastric ulcer demonstrated that HPO CM treatment significantly accelerated wound healing by suppressing inflammation and promoting neovascularization and re-epithelization. Meanwhile, the infusion of HPO CM activated the COX2-PGE2 axis both in vitro and in vivo. And the upregulation of COX2 was further dependent on the activation of ErK1/2-MAPK pathway. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL-20) were analyzed as being highly abundant factors secreted by ADMSCs under hypoxic condition. Notably, the blockade of CCL-20 abrogated the HPO CM-induced COX2 signaling in the primary gastric mucosal epithelial cells, while incubation with recombinant CCL-20 increased the expression of COX2. In conclusion, the secretome from hypoxia-conditioned ADMSCs facilitates the repair of gastric mucosal injury through the enhancement of angiogenesis and re-epithelization, as well as the activation of COX2-PGE2 axis with a paracrine activity involving CCL-20 factor.","PMID":28993190,"authors":[{"lastName":"Xia","initials":"X","foreName":"Xianfeng"},{"lastName":"Chiu","initials":"PWY","foreName":"Philip Wai Yan"},{"lastName":"Lam","initials":"PK","foreName":"Ping Kuen"},{"lastName":"Chin","initials":"WC","foreName":"Wai Ching"},{"lastName":"Ng","initials":"EKW","foreName":"Enders Kwok Wai"},{"lastName":"Lau","initials":"JYW","foreName":"James Yun Wong"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17448,"articleTitle":"Citrate Addition Increased Phosphorus Bioavailability and Enhanced Gasoline Bioremediation.","dateCreated":"2017-10-09","dateRevised":"2017-10-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"0047-2425","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of environmental quality","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Alternatively, citrate addition may inhibit activity due to competitive effects on carbon metabolism. Using a field-scale in situ biostimulation study, we evaluated if citrate could stimulate gasoline degradation and what the dominant mechanism of this stimulation will be. Two large bore injectors were constructed at a site contaminated with gasoline, and a biostimulation solution of 11 mM MgSO, 1 mM HPO, and 0.08 mM HNO at pH 6.5 in municipal potable water was injected at ∼5000 L d for about 4 mo. Following this, 10 mM citric acid was incorporated into the existing biostimulation solution and the site continued to be stimulated for 8 mo. After citrate addition, the bioavailable P fraction in groundwater and soil increased. Iron(II) groundwater concentrations increased and corresponded to decreases in benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX) in groundwater, as well as a decrease in F1 in the soil saturated zone.

Patients and methods - The literature review was based on the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project. From the HPO dataset, all phenotypes describing preaxial polydactyly were obtained and related diseases were identified and selected. An overview was generated in a heatmap, in which the phenotypic contribution of 12 anatomical groups to each disease is displayed.

Results - From the HPO dataset, 21 diseases were related to preaxial polydactyly of the foot. The anatomical groups with the highest phenotypic contribution were lower limb, upper limb, and craniofacial. From our clinical database, we included 76 patients with 9 different diseases, of which 27 had a GLI3 mutation.

In patients with isolated preaxial polydactyly of the foot, referral to a clinical geneticist is not mandatory. In patients with additional malformations, consultation with a clinical geneticist is recommended.

Oxidative stress has been reported to be closely related to the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of PD. One therapeutic strategy is to alleviate neuronal injuries caused by oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated protective effects of royal jelly (RJ) fatty acids and their derivatives on oxidative stress-induced cell death using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. 4-Hydroperoxy-2-decenoic acid ethyl ester (HPO-DAEE), a synthesized RJ fatty acid derivative, markedly induced antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Pretreatment with HPO-DAEE protected against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidative responses, plays a key role in the acquisition of resistance to oxidative stress. HPO-DAEE elicited nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and activated antioxidant response element (ARE), a cis-activating regulatory element, indicating that HPO-DAEE induced expression of antioxidant genes through Nrf2-ARE signaling. Recently, the activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) has been shown to cooperate with Nrf2 and modulate antioxidant gene expression. We also found that HPO-DAEE promoted phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which is an upstream effector of ATF4, and subsequent nuclear accumulation of ATF4. The eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor, salubrinal, augmented HPO-DAEE-induced HO-1 expression and protection against 6-OHDA-induced cell death. These results indicate that HPO-DAEE activates both the Nrf2-ARE and eIF2α-ATF4 pathways. Moreover, ROS generation occurred upon treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with HPO-DAEE, and the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and glutathione suppressed HPO-DAEE-induced activation of the Nrf2-ARE and eIF2α-ATF4 pathways. Therefore, sublethal oxidative stress caused by HPO-DAEE is likely to activate both these pathways. Taken together, we conclude that HPO-DAEE elicits adaptive responses to oxidative stress through cooperative activation of the Nrf2-ARE and eIF2α-ATF4 pathways.","PMID":28823537,"authors":[{"lastName":"Inoue","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuki"},{"lastName":"Hara","initials":"H","foreName":"Hirokazu"},{"lastName":"Mitsugi","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yukari"},{"lastName":"Yamaguchi","initials":"E","foreName":"Eiji"},{"lastName":"Kamiya","initials":"T","foreName":"Tetsuro"},{"lastName":"Itoh","initials":"A","foreName":"Akichika"},{"lastName":"Adachi","initials":"T","foreName":"Tetsuo"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17398,"articleTitle":"Comprehensive Analysis of Tissue-wide Gene Expression and Phenotype Data Reveals Tissues Affected in Rare Genetic Disorders.","dateCreated":"2017-08-20","dateRevised":"2017-08-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"2405-4712","issnType":"Print","title":"Cell systems","isoAbbreviation":"Cell Syst"},"articleDate":"2017-08-16","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Linking putatively pathogenic variants to the tissues they affect is necessary for determining the correct diagnostic workup and therapeutic regime in undiagnosed patients.

During the past ten years the biological function of Yki has been studied extensively in Drosophila and a few other insects, however, little is known about it in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a major research model of lepidopteran insect. Here, we describe the isolation, characterization and expression of the B. mori Yki ortholog, BmYki. The coding sequence of the BmYki was 1314 bp in length, encoding a protein of 437 amino acids containing two conserved WW domains. BmYki transcripts were ubiquitous but not abundant in all detected tissues and developmental stages. Comparatively, it was expressed at pretty high level in silk glands and at the stage of fifth-instar day-3 larvae. Overexpression of BmYki in cultured B. mori embryonic cells significantly promoted transcription of genes associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating that BmYki functions in the regulation of organ growth-related biological processes. Interestingly, transcription of silk protein-coding genes and transcription factors regulating the synthesis of silk proteins was downregulated remarkably, suggesting that BmYki was involved in the regulation of silk protein synthesis. This study provides new insights into the role of BmYki in Hpo pathway regulation in silkworm.","PMID":28793345,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zeng","initials":"W","foreName":"Wenhui"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"R","foreName":"Riyuan"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"T","foreName":"Tianyang"},{"lastName":"Gong","initials":"C","foreName":"Chunying"},{"lastName":"Zuo","initials":"W","foreName":"Weidong"},{"lastName":"Liu","initials":"R","foreName":"Rongpeng"},{"lastName":"Ou","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yao"},{"lastName":"Xu","initials":"H","foreName":"Hanfu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17386,"articleTitle":"Embedded Isoreticular Zeolites: Concept and Beyond.","dateCreated":"2017-08-08","dateRevised":"2017-09-18","publication":{"issnNumber":"1521-3765","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)","isoAbbreviation":"Chemistry"},"articleDate":"2017-08-08","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The structure solution, prediction, and targeted synthesis of a family of embedded isoreticular zeolites (EIZs) with expanding structural complexity, denoted the RHO family, were reported recently.

Individual toxicity assays have been performed on many DBPs, but few studies have been conducted with complex mixtures such as wastewater effluents. In this work, we compared the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) before and after chloramination. The toxicity of chloraminated EfOM was significantly higher than the toxicity of raw EfOM, and the more hydrophobic fraction (HPO) isolated on XAD-8 resin was more toxic than the fraction isolated on XAD-4 resin. More DBPs were also isolated on the XAD-8 resin. N-DBPs (i.e., haloacetonitriles or haloacetamides) were responsible for the majority of the cytotoxicity estimated from DBP concentrations measured in the XAD-8 and XAD-4 fractions (99.4% and 78.5%, respectively). Measured DBPs accounted for minor proportions of total brominated and chlorinated products, which means that many unknown halogenated compounds were formed and can be responsible for a significant part of the toxicity.

In order to identify a lead product, candidate baits identified from captive badger studies were evaluated in three successive bait screening studies with wild badgers. A fourth field study, using the lead candidate bait and biomarkers, investigated the effectiveness of different carriers for their potential to deliver liquid payloads (vaccine surrogate). In each field study, bait disappearance was monitored daily for ten days and remote video surveillance was used to determine preference (i.e. the order in which baits were taken). In the carrier study, biomarkers were used to determine what proportion of subsequently trapped badgers had ingested the bait and the vaccine-carrier biomarker payload. Across all four studies, 79% (3397/4330) of baits were taken by badgers although the number varied significantly by badger social group and bait type. In all studies, bait disappearance increased over time, with 75-100% of baits being taken by day ten.

To determine the role of the Hippo pathway in stem cells, we examine follicle stem cells (FSCs) in the Drosophila ovary. Yki is detected in the nucleus of FSCs. Knockdown of yki in the follicle cell lineage leads to a disruption of the follicular epithelium. Mitotic clones of FSCs mutant for hpo or wts are maintained in the niche and tend to replace the other FSCs, and FSCs mutant for yki are rapidly lost, demonstrating that the Hippo pathway is both required and sufficient for FSC maintenance. Using genetic interaction analyses, we demonstrate that the Hedgehog pathway acts upstream of the Hippo pathway in regulating FSC maintenance. The nuclear localization of Yki is enhanced when the Hedgehog signaling is activated. Furthermore, a constitutively active but not a wild-type Yki promotes FSC maintenance as activation of the Hedgehog signaling does, suggesting that the Hedgehog pathway regulates Yki through a post-translational mechanism in maintaining FSCs.","PMID":28667262,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hsu","initials":"TH","foreName":"Ta-Hsing"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"CY","foreName":"Chia-Yu"},{"lastName":"Yeh","initials":"TH","foreName":"Tsung-Han"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"YC","foreName":"Yi-Chia"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"TW","foreName":"Tsu-Wei"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"JY","foreName":"Jenn-Yah"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17345,"articleTitle":"Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the porcine hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis.","dateCreated":"2017-06-28","dateRevised":"2017-07-14","publication":{"issnNumber":"2045-2322","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Scientific reports","isoAbbreviation":"Sci Rep"},"articleDate":"2017-06-27","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Previous studies have suggested that DNA methylation in both CpG and CpH (where H\u2009=\u2009C, T or A) contexts plays a critical role in biological functions of different tissues.

Obesity is multifactorial in origin, yet many cases of obesity result from overconsumption of a diet high in fat. Excess dietary fat increases both adipose and nonadipose tissue lipid content and, through lipotoxicity, leads to cell dysfunction and death. High dietary fat intake, with or without the development of obesity, impairs female hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis functionality and fertility. Based on the current evidence, it appears the reproductive dysfunction involves increased leptin and insulin signaling at the various levels of the HPO axis, as well as changes in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ actions and increased inflammation, yet other mechanisms may also be involved. This review summarizes the current body of knowledge on impaired female reproductive function after high-fat diet exposure, as well as discusses proposed mechanisms through which this may occur.","PMID":28586412,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hohos","initials":"NM","foreName":"Natalie M"},{"lastName":"Skaznik-Wikiel","initials":"ME","foreName":"Malgorzata E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17312,"articleTitle":"C. elegans DAF-16/FOXO interacts with TGF-ß/BMP signaling to induce germline tumor formation via mTORC1 activation.","dateCreated":"2017-05-26","dateRevised":"2017-06-28","publication":{"issnNumber":"1553-7404","issnType":"Electronic","title":"PLoS genetics","isoAbbreviation":"PLoS Genet."},"articleDate":"2017-05-26","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Activation of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 by reduced insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) is considered to be beneficial in C. elegans due to its ability to extend lifespan and to enhance stress resistance. In the germline, cell-autonomous DAF-16 activity prevents stem cell proliferation, thus acting tumor-suppressive. In contrast, hypodermal DAF-16 causes a tumorous germline phenotype characterized by hyperproliferation of the germline stem cells and rupture of the adjacent basement membrane. Here we show that cross-talk between DAF-16 and the transforming growth factor ß (TGFß)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling pathway causes germline hyperplasia and results in disruption of the basement membrane. In addition to activating MADM/NRBP/hpo-11 gene alone, DAF-16 also directly interacts with both R-SMAD proteins SMA-2 and SMA-3 in the nucleus to regulate the expression of mTORC1 pathway. Knocking-down of BMP genes or each of the four target genes in the hypodermis was sufficient to inhibit germline proliferation, indicating a cell-non-autonomously controlled regulation of stem cell proliferation by somatic tissues. We propose the existence of two antagonistic DAF-16/FOXO functions, a cell-proliferative somatic and an anti-proliferative germline activity. Whereas germline hyperplasia under reduced IIS is inhibited by DAF-16 cell-autonomously, activation of somatic DAF-16 in the presence of active IIS promotes germline proliferation and eventually induces tumor-like germline growth. In summary, our results suggest a novel pathway crosstalk of DAF-16 and TGF-ß/BMP that can modulate mTORC1 at the transcriptional level to cause stem-cell hyperproliferation. Such cell-type specific differences may help explaining why human FOXO activity is considered to be tumor-suppressive in most contexts, but may become oncogenic, e.g. in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia.","PMID":28549065,"authors":[{"lastName":"Qi","initials":"W","foreName":"Wenjing"},{"lastName":"Yan","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yijian"},{"lastName":"Pfeifer","initials":"D","foreName":"Dietmar"},{"lastName":"Donner V Gromoff","initials":"E","foreName":"Erika"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yimin"},{"lastName":"Maier","initials":"W","foreName":"Wolfgang"},{"lastName":"Baumeister","initials":"R","foreName":"Ralf"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17311,"articleTitle":"Effects of age and weaning conditions on blood indicators of oxidative status in pigs.","dateCreated":"2017-05-25","dateRevised":"2017-09-18","publication":{"issnNumber":"1932-6203","issnType":"Electronic","title":"PloS one","isoAbbreviation":"PLoS ONE"},"articleDate":"2017-05-24","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Weaning is a source of social, nutritional and environmental disorders that challenge piglet health. This study assesses the relevance of using plasma indicators of oxidative status as biomarkers of health around weaning in pigs. Blood antioxidant potential (BAP), hydroperoxides (HPO), oxidative stress index (OSI, e.g. HPO/BAP), vitamin A and E concentrations were investigated in two different trials. Trial A was carried out in an experimental unit to investigate the effects of age (from 12 to 147 days of age), weaning (at 21 or 28 days of age) and management at weaning (in optimal (OC) or deteriorated (DC) conditions) on those parameters. Trial B was performed in 16 commercial pig farms to describe the variability of these indicators on field between 26 and 75 days of age. In trial A, between 12 and 147 days of age, HPO globally increased (P < 0.001), vitamin E concentration decreased (P < 0.001) whereas BAP and vitamin A concentration remained relatively stable (P > 0.1). Vitamins E and A concentrations dropped 5 days after weaning independently of weaning age, weaning conditions and expression of diarrhea (P < 0.001). Twelve days after weaning, whatever the weaning age, HPO and OSI increased in DC compared to OC piglets (P = 0.05 and P < 0.01) and in piglets exhibiting diarrhea compared to those without diarrhea (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). In DC pigs, BAP was also decreased (P < 0.05) 12 days after weaning. On trial B, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E decreased and HPO increased 5 and 19 days respectively after weaning (P < 0,001). Contrarily to trial A, BAP values did not drop after weaning. Piglets which had the lowest ADG (Average Daily Gain) after weaning had greater HPO and OSI and lower vitamin A and E concentrations after weaning but also lower vitamin E concentration before weaning (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HPO or OSI seem to be good indicators of health disorders around weaning and plasma concentration of vitamin E before weaning is associated to growth after weaning.","PMID":28542567,"authors":[{"lastName":"Buchet","initials":"A","foreName":"Arnaud"},{"lastName":"Belloc","initials":"C","foreName":"Catherine"},{"lastName":"Leblanc-Maridor","initials":"M","foreName":"Mily"},{"lastName":"Merlot","initials":"E","foreName":"Elodie"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17309,"articleTitle":"A pipeline combining multiple strategies for prioritizing heterozygous variants for the identification of candidate genes in exome datasets.","dateCreated":"2017-05-23","dateRevised":"2017-05-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"1479-7364","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Human genomics","isoAbbreviation":"Hum.

We hypothesized that decreased cardiac expression of DJ-1, a positive modulator of autophagy, compromises the effectiveness of IPO-induced cardioprotection in diabetic rats. Diabetic rats subjected to myocardial IR (30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion) exhibited more severe myocardial injury, less cardiac autophagy, lower DJ-1 expression and AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway activity than non-diabetic rats. IPO significantly attenuated myocardial injury and up-regulated cardiac DJ-1 expression, AMPK/mTOR activity and autophagy in non-diabetic rats but not in diabetic rats. AAV9 (adeno-associated virus 9)-mediated cardiac DJ-1 overexpression as well as pretreatment with the autophagy inducer rapamycin restored IPO-induced cardioprotection in diabetic rats, an effect accompanied by AMPK/mTOR activation and autophagy up-regulation. Combining HPO (hypoxic post-conditioning) with DJ-1 overexpression markedly attenuated HR (hypoxia-reoxygenation) injury in H9c2 cells with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) exposure, accompanied by AMPK/mTOR signalling activation and autophagy up-regulation. The DJ-1 overexpression-mediated preservation of HPO-induced cardioprotection was completely inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC) and the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (3-methyladenine). Thus, decreased cardiac DJ-1 expression, which results in impaired AMPK/mTOR signalling and decreased autophagy, could be a major mechanism underlying the loss of IPO-induced cardioprotection in diabetes.","PMID":28404768,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhou","initials":"B","foreName":"Bin"},{"lastName":"Lei","initials":"S","foreName":"Shaoqing"},{"lastName":"Xue","initials":"R","foreName":"Rui"},{"lastName":"Leng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yan"},{"lastName":"Xia","initials":"Z","foreName":"Zhengyuan"},{"lastName":"Xia","initials":"ZY","foreName":"Zhong-Yuan"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17261,"articleTitle":"Roles of Phosphoric Acid in Biochar Formation: Synchronously Improving Carbon Retention and Sorption Capacity.","dateCreated":"2017-04-05","dateRevised":"2017-04-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"0047-2425","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of environmental quality","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Ocular and extraocular features were recorded using Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Subsequently, multigene panel testing (105 or 177 IRD-associated genes) was performed in an accredited diagnostic laboratory, followed by clinical variant interpretation.Diagnostic yield and clinical usefulness of genetic testing.Overall, 78.8% of patients (n = 67) received a probable molecular diagnosis; 7.5% (n = 5) of these had autosomal dominant disease, 25.4% (n = 17) had X-linked disease, and 67.2% (n = 45) had autosomal recessive disease. In a further 5.9% of patients (n = 5), a single heterozygous ABCA4 variant was identified; all these participants had a spectrum of clinical features consistent with ABCA4 retinopathy. Most participants (84.7%; n = 72) had undergone EDT and 81.9% (n = 59) of these patients received a probable molecular diagnosis.

Although several variants of CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) protocols are currently available to study the global protein-RNA interaction landscape at single-nucleotide resolution in a cell, currently there are very few tools that can facilitate understanding and dissecting the functional associations of RBPs from the resulting binding maps. Here, we present Seten, a web-based and command line tool, which can identify and compare processes, phenotypes, and diseases associated with RBPs from condition-specific CLIP-seq profiles. Seten uses BED files resulting from most peak calling algorithms, which include scores reflecting the extent of binding of an RBP on the target transcript, to provide both traditional functional enrichment as well as gene set enrichment results for a number of gene set collections including BioCarta, KEGG, Reactome, Gene Ontology (GO), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and MalaCards Disease Ontology for several organisms including fruit fly, human, mouse, rat, worm, and yeast. It also provides an option to dynamically compare the associated gene sets across data sets as bubble charts, to facilitate comparative analysis. Benchmarking of Seten using eCLIP data for IGF2BP1, SRSF7, and PTBP1 against their corresponding CRISPR RNA-seq in K562 cells as well as randomized negative controls, demonstrated that its gene set enrichment method outperforms functional enrichment, with scores significantly contributing to the discovery of true annotations. Comparative performance analysis using these CRISPR control data sets revealed significantly higher precision and comparable recall to that observed using ChIP-Enrich. Seten's web interface currently provides precomputed results for about 200 CLIP-seq data sets and both command line as well as web interfaces can be used to analyze CLIP-seq data sets. We highlight several examples to show the utility of Seten for rapid profiling of various CLIP-seq data sets.

Aim of this study was to analyse and compare clinical and radiological results and complications of locking plate osteosynthesis (LPO) versus hook plate osteosynthesis (HPO) with acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) stabilization. The hypothesis was, that HPO would recreate coracoclavicular stability more effectively and potentially lead to a superior outcome.This retrospective, observational cohort study included 32 patients (19 HPO, 13 LPO) with a mean age of 44.1\u2009±\u200914.2 years at surgery. The mean follow-up period was 54.2 months (range 25.2-111.4 months). Besides standard radiography, bilateral coracoclavicular distances were assessed by means of preoperative and follow-up stress radiographs after implant removal. Clinical outcome measures included the Constant score (CS), the Oxford shoulder score (OSS), the subjective shoulder value (SSV) and the Taft score (TS).Bone union occurred in all but one patient and proved to occur delayed in five patients (15.6%). Radiographical healing required a mean of 4.2\u2009±\u20094.0 months irrespective of the type of osteosynthesis. At follow-up, mean coracoclavicular distance was increased by 34% (±36) without significant differences between both groups. HPO patients obtained a significantly lower TS (HPO: 9.5\u2009±\u20091.5 points, LPO: 11.1\u2009±\u20091.3 points; p\u2009=\u20090.005).

Overall prevalence of complications was significantly higher in the HPO group (p\u2009=\u20090.014).Both HPO and LPO were equally effective in relation to restoration of vertical stability, overall functional outcome and fracture consolidation in treatment of Neer IIB fractures. Contrary to our hypothesis, HPO was not associated with superior recreation of the coracoclavicular distance. Considerable drawbacks of HPO were an inferior ACJ-specific outcome (Taft-Score) and a higher overall complication rate.

In this work, the Suwannee River NOM solution was fractionated into groups with different hydrophobicities using DAX-8 resins, and volatile and semi-volatile DBPs formed during the chlorination, chloramination and ozonation of the NOM fractions were examined by a nontargeted screening of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry procedure. The results showed that a total of 302 DBPs representing nine chemical classes were detected, of which 266 were possibly newly detected, based on library searching with NIST 08 library (using similarity and reverse values of at least 600 and 700, respectively) and linear retention indices. The characterization of DBP precursors suggests that hydrophobic (HPO) NOM contains the major fraction of precursor for the formation of nitrogenous DBPs (contributing about 60% of the total nitrogenous DBPs) during all three disinfection processes. Much larger amounts of heterocyclic DBPs were formed from the HPO fraction than from the hydrophilic fraction during chlorination. During chloramination and ozonation, 5-15 times more ketones were formed from the hydrophilic fraction than from the HPO fraction. During ozonation, more than twice the amounts of esters and alcohols were formed from the hydrophilic fraction than from the HPO fraction. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix spectra suggest that similar to the formation of regulated DBPs, humic acid-like substances are probably the precursors of halogen-containing DBPs. Relatively higher nitrogenous DBPs formation from the HPO fraction might be because of the existence of protein-like materials.","PMID":28238434,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"C","foreName":"Chunmei"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"D","foreName":"Donghong"},{"lastName":"Xu","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiong"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Z","foreName":"Zijian"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17220,"articleTitle":"Whole genome sequencing of one complex pedigree illustrates challenges with genomic medicine.","dateCreated":"2017-02-23","dateRevised":"2017-10-27","publication":{"issnNumber":"1755-8794","issnType":"Electronic","title":"BMC medical genomics","isoAbbreviation":"BMC Med Genomics"},"articleDate":"2017-02-23","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has risen as a useful tool for precision medicine by providing a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities to describe presentations of human pathologies; however, there have been relatively few reports combining whole genome sequencing (WGS) and HPO, especially in the context of structural variants.We illustrate an integrative analysis of WGS and HPO using an extended pedigree, which involves Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and dysautonomia-like symptoms. A comprehensive WGS pipeline was used to ensure reliable detection of genomic variants. Beyond variant filtering, we pursued phenotypic prioritization of candidate genes using Phenolyzer.Regarding PWS, WGS confirmed a 5.5 Mb de novo deletion of the parental allele at 15q11.2 to 15q13.1. Phenolyzer successfully returned the diagnosis of PWS, and pinpointed clinically relevant genes in the deletion. Further, Phenolyzer revealed how each of the genes is linked with the phenotypes represented by HPO terms. For HH, WGS identified a known disease variant (p.C282Y) in HFE of an affected female. Analysis of HPO terms alone fails to provide a correct diagnosis, but Phenolyzer successfully revealed the phenotype-genotype relationship using a disease-centric approach. Finally, Phenolyzer also revealed the complexity behind dysautonomia-like symptoms, and seven variants that might be associated with the phenotypes were identified by manual filtering based on a dominant inheritance model.The integration of WGS and HPO can inform comprehensive molecular diagnosis for patients, eliminate false positives and reveal novel insights into undiagnosed diseases. Due to extreme heterogeneity and insufficient knowledge of human diseases, it is also important that phenotypic and genomic data are standardized and shared simultaneously.","PMID":28228131,"authors":[{"lastName":"Fang","initials":"H","foreName":"Han"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yiyang"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"H","foreName":"Hui"},{"lastName":"Yoon","initials":"M","foreName":"Margaret"},{"lastName":"Jiménez-Barrón","initials":"LT","foreName":"Laura T"},{"lastName":"Mittelman","initials":"D","foreName":"David"},{"lastName":"Robison","initials":"R","foreName":"Reid"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"K","foreName":"Kai"},{"lastName":"Lyon","initials":"GJ","foreName":"Gholson J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17214,"articleTitle":"Succinimide Formation from an NGR-Containing Cyclic Peptide: Computational Evidence for Catalytic Roles of Phosphate Buffer and the Arginine Side Chain.","dateCreated":"2017-02-17","dateRevised":"2017-04-28","publication":{"issnNumber":"1422-0067","issnType":"Electronic","title":"International journal of molecular sciences","isoAbbreviation":"Int J Mol Sci"},"articleDate":"2017-02-16","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) motif and its deamidation product isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR) have recently attracted considerable attention as tumor-targeting ligands.

It is well known that the Asn deamidation proceeds via a succinimide derivative. In the present study, we computationally investigated the mechanism of succinimide formation from a cyclic peptide, c[CH\u2082CO-NGRC]-NH\u2082, which has recently been shown to undergo rapid deamidation in a phosphate buffer. An H\u2082PO\u2084(-) ion was explicitly included in the calculations. We employed the density functional theory using the B3LYP functional. While geometry optimizations were performed in the gas phase, hydration Gibbs energies were calculated by the SM8 (solvation model 8) continuum model. We have found a pathway leading to the five-membered ring tetrahedral intermediate in which both the H\u2082PO\u2084(-) ion and the Arg side chain act as catalyst. This intermediate, once protonated at the NH\u2082 group on the five-membered ring, was shown to easily undergo NH\u2083 elimination leading to the succinimide formation. This study is the first to propose a possible catalytic role for the Arg side chain in the NGR deamidation.","PMID":28212316,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kirikoshi","initials":"R","foreName":"Ryota"},{"lastName":"Manabe","initials":"N","foreName":"Noriyoshi"},{"lastName":"Takahashi","initials":"O","foreName":"Ohgi"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17211,"articleTitle":"The Risk of Ischemic Cardio- and Cerebrovascular Events Associated with Oxycodone-Naloxone and Other Extended-Release High-Potency Opioids: A Nested Case-Control Study.","dateCreated":"2017-02-14","dateRevised":"2017-05-16","publication":{"issnNumber":"1179-1942","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Drug safety","isoAbbreviation":"Drug Saf"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In Germany, an extended-release (ER) combination of the high-potency opioid (HPO) oxycodone and the antagonist naloxone was approved in 2006.

The data set used encompassed raw and treated water sampled over a 30-month period from 30 water treatment works (WTWs) across Scotland, all employing conventional clarification. Both trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) FPs were considered. In addition to the standard bulk WQDs, the DOC content was fractionated and analysed for the hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. Results were quantified in terms of the yield (dDBPFP/dWQD) and the linear regression coefficient R(2) of the yield trend. The NOM in the raw waters was found to comprise 30-84% (average 66%) of the more reactive HPO material, with this proportion falling to 18-63% (average 50%) in the treated water. Results suggested UV254 to be as good an indicator of DBPFP as DOC or HPO for the raw waters, with R(2) values ranging from 0.79 to 0.82 for THMs and from 0.71 to 0.73 for HAAs for these three determinants. For treated waters the corresponding values were significantly lower at 0.52-0.67 and 0.46-0.47 respectively, reflecting the lower HPO concentration and thus UV254 absorption and commensurately reduced precision due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument. It is concluded that fractionation offers little benefit in attempting to discern or predict chlorinated carbonaceous DBP yield for the waters across the geographical region studied.

An automated follow-up tool is incorporated that informs all users whenever a variant classification has changed. These unique features fully embedded in a CLIA/CAP-accredited quality management system allow appropriate data quality and enhanced patient safety.More than 100,000 genetically screened individuals are documented in the database, resulting in more than 470 million variant detections.

They mainly deal with its performances to decrease the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of MSWL and no information is given on the impact of the specific characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in leachate on these performances. DOM in leachate evolves towards more aromatic and hydrophobic compounds during landfilling with increasing specific ultra-violet absorbance index (SUVA) and hydrophobic character. However, according to the humification stages, this DOM would not present the same aptitude for AD. This research thus focused on (i) optimizing a biochemical methane potential (BMP) test applied to MSWL by using the Taguchi method and (ii) evaluating the impact of the hydrophobic character of the DOM in leachate on the BMP of MSWL to finally define the humification degree more suitable for AD. Hydrophobic-like (HPO(∗)) and transphilic-like (TPH(∗)) compounds extracted from leachate by a fractionation protocol were tested because of their high content in MSWL during acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps. After 275days of AD, the content in hydrophobic compounds and the SUVA indexes increased in the digestates. Moreover, even if the biogas and methane productions were not significantly different during the whole tests (4072±350mLgDOC(-1) and 2370±95mLgDOC(-1) respectively), the volume of biogas produced directly correlated with the TPH(∗) fraction content in the initial digestates. On the contrary, the methane percentage in biogas was anti-correlated with the hydrophilic-like compounds content. The hydrophobic-like molecules seem thus not to be directly involved in the methanogenic step, however they promote the increase of the methane percent in the biogas.","PMID":27931936,"authors":[{"lastName":"Baccot","initials":"C","foreName":"Camille"},{"lastName":"Pallier","initials":"V","foreName":"Virginie"},{"lastName":"Feuillade-Cathalifaud","initials":"G","foreName":"Geneviève"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17140,"articleTitle":"The role of extracellular biophysical cues in modulating the Hippo-YAP pathway.","dateCreated":"2016-12-05","dateRevised":"2017-04-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1976-670X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"BMB reports","isoAbbreviation":"BMB Rep"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Hippo signaling pathway plays an essential role in adult-tissue homeostasis and organ-size control. In Drosophila and vertebrates, it consists of a highly conserved kinase cascade, which involves MST and Lats that negatively regulate the activity of the downstream transcription coactivators, YAP and TAZ. By interacting with TEADs and other transcription factors, they mediate both proliferative and antiapoptotic gene expression and thus regulate tissue repair and regeneration. Dysregulation or mutation of the Hippo pathway is linked to tumorigenesis and cancer development. Recent studies have uncovered multiple upstream inputs, including cell density, mechanical stress, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, and nutrients, that modulate Hippo pathway activity. This review focuses on the role of the Hippo pathway as effector of these biophysical cues and its potential implications in tissue homeostasis and cancer.

One of the characteristic histological features of meningiomas is the whorl formation of neoplastic arachnoid cells. NF2 is a human homolog of the Drosophila gene, Merlin (Mer). In humans, NF2 is the gene responsible for the disease neurofibromatosis type II, which results in the development of brain tumors, including acoustic neurinoma and meningioma. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of spinal meningioma. It was hypothesized that the whorl formation of meningiomas may occur as a result of a disturbance in the planar cell polarity (PCP) of arachnoid cells, thus, genes understood to govern PCP signaling were analyzed for alterations. Whole exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing validation was performed for the analysis of spinal meningioma tissue obtained from a 42-year-old Japanese female. The sequencing identified a nonsynonymous mutation of c.3597G>C, resulting in p.Q1199H, in the FAT atypical cadherin 2 (FAT2) gene. FAT2 is homologous to the Drosophila Fat (Ft) gene, which belongs to the cadherin superfamily. Drosophila Fat is involved in PCP, tumor suppression and Hippo (Hpo) signaling, which is associated with Mer. Taken together, the results of the present study concluded that human FAT2 may function as a key molecule that governs not only PCP, but also NF2-Hpo signaling in arachnoid cells; thus, a mutation in this gene may result in spinal meningioma.","PMID":27900010,"authors":[{"lastName":"Tate","initials":"G","foreName":"Genshu"},{"lastName":"Kishimoto","initials":"K","foreName":"Koji"},{"lastName":"Mitsuya","initials":"T","foreName":"Toshiyuki"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17135,"articleTitle":"MalaCards: an amalgamated human disease compendium with diverse clinical and genetic annotation and structured search.","dateCreated":"2016-11-30","dateRevised":"2017-10-02","publication":{"issnNumber":"1362-4962","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nucleic acids research","isoAbbreviation":"Nucleic Acids Res."},"articleDate":"2016-11-28","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The MalaCards human disease database (http://www.malacards.org/) is an integrated compendium of annotated diseases mined from 68 data sources.

Moreover, the transfer learning through GO term-gene associations significantly improved association predictions for the phenotypes with no more specific known associations by a large margin.

Major PM chemical components have been characterized for their light absorption and scattering efficiency, but separating the organic components has yet to be fully parameterized with light extinction coefficients. In this study, light extinction data and PM2.5 chemical composition data were monitored at a suburban site in Hong Kong over a two-year period (2013-2014). Using the IMPROVE formula to reconstruct the light scattering coefficient under-estimates the measured scattering coefficient (slope=0.85), but explains the data variability well (R(2): 0.92). A multilinear regression analysis using the 'local' PM2.5 composition data and measured extinction coefficients was performed to empirically establish mass scattering and absorption efficiencies (i.e., MSE and MAE) for the different PM2.5 components. During this process, the stepwise separation of organic matter (OM) was performed according to water solubility: water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and water insoluble organic carbon (WISOC); then according to water affinity: hydrophilic carbon (HPI) and hydrophobic carbon (HPO), the latter being the sum of humic-like substance carbon (HULISc) and WISOC. The localized formulas predict the measured extinction coefficients (i.e., σsp and σap) very well (slope=0.99 for both). The results showed that the dry MSE of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate were comparable with those used in the IMPROVE equation while MSE for OC is noticeably larger in the localized formula (13.1 vs. 7.2m(2)g(-1)).

The most common cause of AUB in these girls, when other pathologies have been excluded, is dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). The aim of this review is to assess the role of DUB as an early symptom of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis later in life. A review of the literature was performed, using Pubmed and Medline as primary databases, regarding the correlation between DUB cases early after menarche and PCOS diagnosis in the future. The most plausible pathophysiological mechanism in the vast majority of DUB cases is the immaturity of hypothalamic pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis. Similarities between normal changes in puberty and PCOS later in life such as: increased ovarian and adrenal steroidogenesis, hyperpulsatile gonadotropin secretion, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, anovulation and therefore menstrual irregularity, including DUB, have been noted in several studies. Anovulation, which can be first expressed as DUB at perimenarchal age, may persist and strengthen PCOS diagnostic criteria sometime during lifetime. Thorough attention should be paid, by specialized doctors in pediatric and adolescent gynecology, in DUB cases after menarche, while proper follow up of these girls is mandatory, due to their increased risk to manifest PCOS in the near future.","PMID":27787478,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deligeoroglou","initials":"E","foreName":"Efthimios"},{"lastName":"Karountzos","initials":"V","foreName":"Vasileios"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17091,"articleTitle":"Vamana Couples Fat Signaling to the Hippo Pathway.","dateCreated":"2016-10-17","dateRevised":"2017-10-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"1878-1551","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Developmental cell","isoAbbreviation":"Dev.

Vamana, an SH3-domain-containing protein, physically associates with and co-localizes with Dachs and promotes its membrane localization. Vamana also associates with the Dachsous intracellular domain and with a region of the Fat intracellular domain that is essential for controlling Hippo signaling and levels of Dachs.

Three non-lactating Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulae were used in a 3×3 Latin square design with three periods consisting of 21 days. Dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet (Control, no fat supplement) and the basal diet supplemented with SO (2.7% of dry matter (DM)) or HPO (2.7% of DM). Ruminal digesta pH, NH3-N and volatile fatty acids were not affected by dietary treatments. Compared with control and HPO, total bacteria measured as copies of 16S ribosomal DNA/ml by quantitative PCR was decreased (P<0.05) by SO. Fibrobacter succinogenes, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Anaerovibrio lipolytica loads were not affected by dietary treatments.

In our study, photo-degradation of fluoroquinolone norfloxacin was investigated. A rapid degradation in buffered water was observed with a first-order rate constant of 2.45/hr and a quantum yield of 0.039. After light screening correction, selected DOMs (5 mg C/L) slightly enhanced the photodegradation rate with the exception of Suwannee river hydrophobic organic matter (SR-HPO). Three major photo-products were identified using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). With (1)O2 dark formation and competitor experiments, norfloxacin self-sensitized (1)O2 was found to oxidize norfloxacin by inducing its piperazine chain cleavage. DOMs exhibited a dual role by inhibiting the (1)O2-mediated reaction while enhancing the heterolytic defluorination pathway. DOMs were proposed to enhance heterolytic defluorination by donating electron to triplet state FLQ, this proposal was supported with specific UV absorbance (SUVA) as an indicator for the abundance of π bonds. Fluoride formation indicated a 79% elimination ratio of fluorine, an important functional group for antimicrobial activity.

Throughout the lifespan, the extent to which each of the hormones impacts bone differs. Understanding the independent and combined impact of these hormones on controlling bone remodeling allows for the development of more informed decision making regarding pharmacology, specifically the use of hormonal medication, at all ages. Endocrine control of bone health in women is largely dictated by the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Growth hormone, secreted from the pituitary gland, stimulates cells in almost every tissue to secrete IGF-1, although the majority of circulating IGF-1 is produced hepatically. Indeed, systemic IGF-1 concentrations have been found to be correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) in both pre- and post-menopausal women and is often used as a marker of bone formation. Sex steroids produced by the ovaries, namely estradiol, mediate bone resorption through binding to estrogen receptors on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Specifically, by increasing osteoclast apoptosis and decreasing osteoblast apoptosis, adequate estrogen levels prevent excessive bone resorption, which helps to explain the rapid decline in bone mass that occurs with the menopausal decrease in estrogen production. Though there are documented correlations between endogenous estrogen concentrations and GH/IGF-1 dynamics, this relationship changes across the lifespan as sex-steroid dynamics fluctuate and, possibly, as tissue responsiveness to GH stimulation decreases. Aside from the known role of endogenous sex steroids on bone health, the impact of exogenous estrogen administration is of interest, as exogenous formulations further modulate GH and IGF-1 production. However, the effect and extent of GH and IGF-1 modulation seems to be largely dependent on age at administration and route of administration. Specifically, premenopausal women using combined oral contraceptive therapy (COC), post-menopausal women taking oral hormone therapy (HT), and both pre- and post-menopausal women using a transdermal form of estrogen therapy (COC or HT) demonstrate disparate GH/IGF-1 responses to exogenous estrogen. This review serves to summarize what is currently known regarding the influence of exogenous estrogen administration across the lifespan on the GH/IGF-1 axis and implications for bone health.","PMID":27693042,"authors":[{"lastName":"Southmayd","initials":"EA","foreName":"Emily A"},{"lastName":"De Souza","initials":"MJ","foreName":"Mary Jane"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17054,"articleTitle":"Genetic analysis of hereditary gingival fibromatosis using whole exome sequencing and bioinformatics.","dateCreated":"2016-09-10","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1601-0825","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Oral diseases","isoAbbreviation":"Oral Dis"},"articleDate":"2016-10-10","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Our study aims to identify genetic variants associated with hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) by applying whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analyses such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein functional network study.Two affected siblings whose grandparents and parents have normal gingiva were chosen for our investigation.

To review progress in the field, the analysis compared the best methods from CAFA1 to those of CAFA2.The top-performing methods in CAFA2 outperformed those from CAFA1. This increased accuracy can be attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental annotations and improved methods for function prediction. The assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing algorithms is ontology specific, that different performance metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions, and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological process and human phenotype ontologies.

The underlying mechanisms of this interplay, however, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Strip, a component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex that regulates these processes, is required to ensure the proper development of synaptic boutons at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. In doing so, Strip negatively regulates the activity of the Hippo (Hpo) pathway, an evolutionarily conserved regulator of organ size whose role in synapse formation is currently unappreciated. Strip functions genetically with Enabled, an actin assembly/elongation factor and the presumptive downstream target of Hpo signaling, to modulate local actin organization at synaptic termini. This regulation occurs independently of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie, the canonical downstream target of the Hpo pathway. Our study identifies a previously unanticipated role of the Strip-Hippo pathway in synaptic development, linking cell signaling to actin organization.","PMID":27545887,"authors":[{"lastName":"Sakuma","initials":"C","foreName":"Chisako"},{"lastName":"Saito","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yoshie"},{"lastName":"Umehara","initials":"T","foreName":"Tomoki"},{"lastName":"Kamimura","initials":"K","foreName":"Keisuke"},{"lastName":"Maeda","initials":"N","foreName":"Nobuaki"},{"lastName":"Mosca","initials":"TJ","foreName":"Timothy J"},{"lastName":"Miura","initials":"M","foreName":"Masayuki"},{"lastName":"Chihara","initials":"T","foreName":"Takahiro"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17029,"articleTitle":"Struvite Precipitation as a Means of Recovering Nutrients and Mitigating Ammonia Toxicity in a Two-Stage Anaerobic Digester Treating Protein-Rich Feedstocks.","dateCreated":"2016-08-16","dateRevised":"2017-04-17","publication":{"issnNumber":"1420-3049","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","isoAbbreviation":"Molecules"},"articleDate":"2016-08-03","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Accumulation of ammonia, measured as total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), a product of protein decomposition in slaughterhouse wastes, inhibits the anaerobic digestion process, reducing digester productivity and leading to failure.

How the pathway coordinates restricting proliferation with organ size control remains a major unanswered question. Here we identify Rae1 as a highly-conserved target of the Hippo Pathway integrating proliferation and organ size. Genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila cells and tissues and in mammalian cells indicate that Hippo signaling promotes Rae1 degradation downstream of Warts/Lats. In proliferating cells, Rae1 loss restricts cyclin B levels and organ size while Rae1 over-expression increases cyclin B levels and organ size, similar to Hippo Pathway over-activation or loss-of-function, respectively. Importantly, Rae1 regulation by the Hippo Pathway is crucial for its regulation of cyclin B and organ size; reducing Rae1 blocks cyclin B accumulation and suppresses overgrowth caused by Hippo Pathway loss. Surprisingly, in addition to suppressing overgrowth, reducing Rae1 also compromises survival of epithelial tissue overgrowing due to loss of Hippo signaling leading to a tissue \"synthetic lethality\" phenotype. Excitingly, Rae1 plays a highly conserved role to reduce the levels and activity of the Yki/YAP oncogene. Rae1 increases activation of the core kinases Hippo and Warts and plays a post-transcriptional role to increase the protein levels of the Merlin, Hippo, and Warts components of the pathway; therefore, in addition to Rae1 coordinating organ size regulation with proliferative control, we propose that Rae1 also acts in a feedback circuit to regulate pathway homeostasis.","PMID":27494403,"authors":[{"lastName":"Jahanshahi","initials":"M","foreName":"Maryam"},{"lastName":"Hsiao","initials":"K","foreName":"Kuangfu"},{"lastName":"Jenny","initials":"A","foreName":"Andreas"},{"lastName":"Pfleger","initials":"CM","foreName":"Cathie M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17016,"articleTitle":"Size regulation blossoms in Kobe.","dateCreated":"2016-08-03","dateRevised":"2017-09-06","publication":{"issnNumber":"1477-9129","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Development (Cambridge, England)","isoAbbreviation":"Development"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Coincident with the blossoming of the sakura was the 14th annual CDB Symposium hosted by the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the ultrasonic treatment conditions and the antiglycation activity of PBH. A mathematical model was generated with an artificial neural network (ANN) toolbox from MATLAB to analyze the effects of ultrasonic treatment conditions on antiglycation activity. The response surface plots showed relationships between ultrasonic extraction conditions and bioactivity. The R(2) value of the model was 0.9919, which suggested good fitness of the neural network. The application of genetic algorithms showed that the optimal ultrasonic extraction conditions resulted in the highest antiglycation activity for PBH. These were 150W, 46°C, and 35min. These conditions produced a predicted antiglycation activity of 41.2%; the actual activity was 40.9% under optimal conditions. This is very close to the predicted value. The experimental data indicated that the PBH possessed both antiglycation and antioxidant activities. The maximum actual value of antiglycation was 101.7% that of the positive control, and the PBH inhibited the DPPH free radicals with an EC50 value of 0.98mg/mL. This is 66.2% that of ascorbic acid.

Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a database of human genetic diseases and related genes that has become an authoritative source of disease phenotypes. However, disease phenotypes have been described by free text; thus, standardization of phenotypic descriptions is needed before diseases can be compared. Several disease phenotype networks have been established in OMIM using different standardization methods. Two of these networks are important for phenotypic similarity analysis: the first and most commonly used network (mimMiner) is standardized by medical subject heading, and the other network (resnikHPO) is the first to be standardized by human phenotype ontology. This paper comprehensively evaluates for the first time the accuracy of these two networks in gene prioritization based on protein-protein interactions using large-scale, leave-one-out cross-validation experiments. The results show that both networks can effectively prioritize disease-causing genes, and the approach that relates two diseases using a logistic function improves prioritization performance. Tanimoto, one of four methods for normalizing resnikHPO, generates a symmetric network and it performs similarly to mimMiner. Furthermore, an integration of these two networks outperforms either network alone in gene prioritization, indicating that these two disease networks are complementary.","PMID":27415759,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"J","foreName":"Jianhua"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaoyan"},{"lastName":"Teng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yueyang"},{"lastName":"Qi","initials":"S","foreName":"Shouliang"},{"lastName":"Xiao","initials":"D","foreName":"Dayu"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jianying"},{"lastName":"Kang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yan"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17056,"articleTitle":"Impact of Food Restriction on the Expression of the Adiponectin System and Genes in the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian Axis of Pre-Pubertal Ewes.","dateCreated":"2016-09-12","dateRevised":"2017-04-10","publication":{"issnNumber":"1439-0531","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene","isoAbbreviation":"Reprod.

Recent studies uncover multiple upstream regulatory inputs into Hippo signalling, which affects phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivator Yki/YAP/TAZ by Wts/Lats. Here we identify the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as a new upstream branch of the Hippo pathway. In Drosophila, overexpression of MAPKK gene licorne (lic), or MAPKKK gene Mekk1, promotes Yki activity and induces Hippo target gene expression. Loss-of-function studies show that lic regulates Hippo signalling in ovary follicle cells and in the wing disc. Epistasis analysis indicates that Mekk1 and lic affect Hippo signalling via p38b and wts We further demonstrate that the Mekk1-Lic-p38b cascade inhibits Hippo signalling by promoting F-actin accumulation and Jub phosphorylation. In addition, p38 signalling modulates actin filaments and Hippo signalling in parallel to small GTPases Ras, Rac1, and Rho1. Lastly, we show that p38 signalling regulates Hippo signalling in mammalian cell lines. The Lic homologue MKK3 promotes nuclear localization of YAP via the actin cytoskeleton. Upregulation or downregulation of the p38 pathway regulates YAP-mediated transcription. Our work thus reveals a conserved crosstalk between the p38 MAPK pathway and the Hippo pathway in growth regulation.","PMID":27402810,"authors":[{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"D","foreName":"Dashun"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaojiao"},{"lastName":"Sun","initials":"L","foreName":"Li"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"P","foreName":"Ping"},{"lastName":"Ying","initials":"H","foreName":"Hao"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"H","foreName":"Hui"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"J","foreName":"Jiarui"},{"lastName":"Song","initials":"H","foreName":"Haiyun"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17029,"articleTitle":"Design of a Water Soluble Fluorescent 3-Hydroxy-4-Pyridinone Ligand Active at Physiological pH Values.","dateCreated":"2016-08-16","dateRevised":"2017-10-27","publication":{"issnNumber":"1573-4994","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of fluorescence","isoAbbreviation":"J Fluoresc"},"articleDate":"2016-06-29","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In the present work we report the structure and the spectroscopic characterization of a new fluorescent 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone ligand D-3,4-HPO.

The interaction of the ligand with copper(II) was accessed by fluorescence spectroscopy in MOPS buffer and the results show that the presence of copper(II) quenches the fluorescence of the ligand in ca 94 % at a ligand: metal ratio of 2:1. The latter result is consistent with the formation of a copper(II) complex with the bidentate ligand, as confirmed by the EPR spectroscopy.

This article reviews the current scientific literature regarding marijuana use and hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis regulation, ovarian hormone production, the menstrual cycle, and fertility. Evidence suggests that marijuana can reduce female fertility by disrupting hypothalamic release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to reduced estrogen and progesterone production and anovulatory menstrual cycles. Tolerance to these effects has been shown in rhesus monkeys, but the effects of chronic marijuana use on human female reproduction are largely unknown. Marijuana-induced analgesia, drug reinforcement properties, tolerance, and dependence are influenced by ovarian hormones, with estrogen generally increasing and progesterone decreasing sensitivity to marijuana. Carefully controlled regulation of the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) is required for successful reproduction, and the exogenous cannabinoids in marijuana may disrupt the delicate balance of the ECS in the female reproductive system.","PMID":27354844,"authors":[{"lastName":"Brents","initials":"LK","foreName":"Lisa K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17025,"articleTitle":"Cross-Talk Between Mitochondrial Fusion and the Hippo Pathway in Controlling Cell Proliferation During Drosophila Development.","dateCreated":"2016-08-12","dateRevised":"2017-08-01","publication":{"issnNumber":"1943-2631","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Genetics","isoAbbreviation":"Genetics"},"articleDate":"2016-06-17","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Cell proliferation and tissue growth depend on the coordinated regulation of multiple signaling molecules and pathways during animal development. Previous studies have linked mitochondrial function and the Hippo signaling pathway in growth control. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we identify a Drosophila mitochondrial inner membrane protein ChChd3 as a novel regulator for tissue growth. Loss of ChChd3 leads to tissue undergrowth and cell proliferation defects. ChChd3 is required for mitochondrial fusion and removal of ChChd3 increases mitochondrial fragmentation. ChChd3 is another mitochondrial target of the Hippo pathway, although it is only partially required for Hippo pathway-mediated overgrowth. Interestingly, lack of ChChd3 leads to inactivation of Hippo activity under normal development, which is also dependent on the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Furthermore, loss of ChChd3 induces oxidative stress and activates the JNK pathway. In addition, depletion of other mitochondrial fusion components, Opa1 or Marf, inactivates the Hippo pathway as well. Taken together, we propose that there is a cross-talk between mitochondrial fusion and the Hippo pathway, which is essential in controlling cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis in Drosophila.","PMID":27317679,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deng","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qiannan"},{"lastName":"Guo","initials":"T","foreName":"Ting"},{"lastName":"Zhou","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiu"},{"lastName":"Xi","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yongmei"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaohang"},{"lastName":"Ge","initials":"W","foreName":"Wanzhong"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16995,"articleTitle":"Changes in the Fatty Acid Profile and Phospholipid Molecular Species Composition of Human Erythrocyte Membranes after Hybrid Palm and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Supplementation.","dateCreated":"2016-07-13","dateRevised":"2017-04-07","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5118","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of agricultural and food chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"J.

In this article, we identify the insulator protein BEAF-32 as a regulator of Hippo pathway activity in Drosophila photoreceptor differentiation. Though morphologically uniform, the fly eye is composed of two subtypes of R8 photoreceptor neurons defined by expression of light-detecting Rhodopsin proteins. In one R8 subtype, active Hippo signaling induces Rhodopsin 6 (Rh6) and represses Rhodopsin 5 (Rh5), whereas in the other subtype, inactive Hippo signaling induces Rh5 and represses Rh6. The activity state of the Hippo pathway in R8 cells is determined by the expression of warts, a core pathway kinase, which interacts with the growth regulator melted in a double-negative feedback loop. We show that BEAF-32 is required for expression of warts and repression of melted Furthermore, BEAF-32 plays a second role downstream of Warts to induce Rh6 and prevent Rh5 fate. BEAF-32 is dispensable for Warts feedback, indicating that BEAF-32 differentially regulates warts and Rhodopsins.

Three lactating and three non-lactating Holstein cows were used in two different 3 × 3 Latin square experiments that included three periods of 21 d. Dietary treatments for lactating cows consisted of a basal diet (control; no fat supplement) and fat-supplemented diets containing SO (500 g/d per cow) or HPO (500 g/d per cow).

Impaired reproductive capacity in obese women is often attributed to anovulation. However, obese women with ovulatory cycles also have reduced fertility, but the etiology of their impaired reproduction is only partially understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that obesity directly impairs oocyte and embryo quality as well as endometrial receptivity. In obese women, urinary progesterone metabolite excretion is decreased, but in excess of what can be explained by suppressed gonadotropin secretion, suggesting that apart from its central effect obesity may directly affect progesterone (P4) production. These observations have led to the novel hypothesis that obesity directly affects corpus luteum (CL) function. Similarly, we hypothesize that weight loss may contribute to luteal dysfunction. Here, we propose a non-human primate model, the vervet monkey, to examine the effect of weight gain and loss on menstrual cycle parameters and CL gene expression. In this model, weight gain and loss did not significantly alter menstrual cyclicity; however, both induced alterations in the CL transcriptome. In the weight gain monkey, we observed that impaired mid-luteal P4 secretion was associated with downregulation of steroidogenic pathways in CL. Collectively, these preliminary findings support our hypothesis that weight gain and loss may contribute to CL dysfunction. The vervet model described and preliminary observations provide a basis for a larger study to address this important question. Understanding the mechanisms by which weight gain and loss contribute to reproductive dysfunction can assist in the development of targeted treatments to enhance women's reproductive capability when it is desired.CL: corpus luteum; P4: progesterone; E2: estradiol; PDG: pregnanediol 3-glucoronide; LH: luteinizing hormone; FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone; GnRH: gonadotropin releasing hormone; BMI: body mass index; qrtPCR: quantitative real-time PCR; PGR: progesterone receptor; ART: assisted reproductive technology; IVF: in vitro fertilization; HPO: hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis; MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases Gene symbols: LH receptor (LHGCR); cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1); 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (HSD3B2); steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR); LDL receptor (LDLR); scavenger receptor B1 (SCARB1); ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1 (ABCA1); ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 1 (ABCG1); apolipoprotein A (APOA1); 24 dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24); 3-hydroxy-3-methylglytaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR); vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA); vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC); vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1); and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1); amphiregulin (AREG); epiregulin (EREG); CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPBA); cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1); ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospodin type 1 motif 1 (ADAMTS1); matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9); cytochrome b-245 beta polypeptide (CYBB or NOX2); NADH oxidase (NCF2 or NOXA2); Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb (FCGR2B); Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb (FCGR2C); ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1); RAB27A member RAS oncofamily (RAB27A); hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD); prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase 1 (PTGS1); integrin B2 (ITGB2); leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H); radixin (RDX); ezrin (EZR); nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 2 (NR5A2).","PMID":27187064,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kuokkanen","initials":"S","foreName":"Satu"},{"lastName":"Polotsky","initials":"AJ","foreName":"Alex J"},{"lastName":"Chosich","initials":"J","foreName":"Justin"},{"lastName":"Bradford","initials":"AP","foreName":"Andrew P"},{"lastName":"Jasinska","initials":"A","foreName":"Anna"},{"lastName":"Phang","initials":"T","foreName":"Tzu"},{"lastName":"Santoro","initials":"N","foreName":"Nanette"},{"lastName":"Appt","initials":"SE","foreName":"Susan E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16954,"articleTitle":"Formation of trihalomethanes of dissolved organic matter fractions in reservoir and canal waters.","dateCreated":"2016-06-02","dateRevised":"2017-08-17","publication":{"issnNumber":"1532-4117","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of environmental science and health.

We describe an extended version of our gene prioritization method, Endeavour, now available for six species and integrating 75 data sources. The performance (Area Under the Curve) of Endeavour on cross-validation benchmarks using 'gold standard' gene sets varies from 88% (for human phenotypes) to 95% (for worm gene function). In addition, we have also validated our approach using a time-stamped benchmark derived from the Human Phenotype Ontology, which provides a setting close to prospective validation. With this benchmark, using 3854 novel gene-phenotype associations, we observe a performance of 82%.

LC8-binding modulates target protein activity, often through induced dimerization via LC8:LC8 homodimers. Although many LC8-interactors have roles in signaling cascades, LC8's role in developing epithelia is poorly understood. Using the Drosophila wing as a developmental model, we find that the LC8 family member Cut up (Ctp) is primarily required to promote epithelial growth, which correlates with effects on the pro-growth factor dMyc and two genes, diap1 and bantam, that are classic targets of the Hippo pathway coactivator Yorkie. Genetic tests confirm that Ctp supports Yorkie-driven tissue overgrowth and indicate that Ctp acts through Yorkie to control bantam (ban) and diap1 transcription. Quite unexpectedly however, Ctp loss has inverse effects on ban and diap1: it elevates ban expression but reduces diap1 expression. In both cases these transcriptional changes map to small segments of these promoters that recruit Yorkie. Although LC8 complexes with Yap1, a Yorkie homolog, in human cells, an orthologous interaction was not detected in Drosophila cells. Collectively these findings reveal that that Drosophila Ctp is a required regulator of Yorkie-target genes in vivo and suggest that Ctp may interact with a Hippo pathway protein(s) to exert inverse transcriptional effects on Yorkie-target genes.","PMID":26972460,"authors":[{"lastName":"Barron","initials":"DA","foreName":"Daniel A"},{"lastName":"Moberg","initials":"K","foreName":"Kenneth"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16870,"articleTitle":"Wound-Induced Polyploidization: Regulation by Hippo and JNK Signaling and Conservation in Mammals.","dateCreated":"2016-03-10","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1932-6203","issnType":"Electronic","title":"PloS one","isoAbbreviation":"PLoS ONE"},"articleDate":"2016-03-09","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Tissue integrity and homeostasis often rely on the proliferation of stem cells or differentiated cells to replace lost, aged, or damaged cells.

Hippo and JNK signaling regulate WIP; unexpectedly however, JNK signaling through AP-1 limits rather than stimulates the level of Yki activation and polyploidization in the Drosophila epidermis.

Our results suggest that WIP is an evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism that maintains the size and synthetic capacity of adult tissues.","PMID":26958853,"authors":[{"lastName":"Losick","initials":"VP","foreName":"Vicki P"},{"lastName":"Jun","initials":"AS","foreName":"Albert S"},{"lastName":"Spradling","initials":"AC","foreName":"Allan C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16869,"articleTitle":"Drosophila Schip1 Links Expanded and Tao-1 to Regulate Hippo Signaling.","dateCreated":"2016-03-09","dateRevised":"2016-11-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"1878-1551","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Developmental cell","isoAbbreviation":"Dev.

In Drosophila, Hpo and Warts kinases are core components of this pathway and function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting Yorkie (Yki). Expanded (Ex) is a regulator of the Hpo activity, but how they are linked is unknown. Here, we show that Schip1, a Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Schwannomin interacting protein 1 (SCHIP1), provides a link between Ex and Hpo. Ex is required for apical localization of Schip1 in imaginal discs. Schip1 is necessary for promoting membrane localization and phosphorylation of Hpo by recruiting the Hpo kinase Tao-1. Taking these findings together, we conclude that Schip1 directly links Ex to Hpo signaling by recruiting Tao-1. This study provides insights into the mechanism of Tao-1 regulation and a potential growth control function for SCHIP1 in mammals.","PMID":26954546,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chung","initials":"HL","foreName":"Hyung-Lok"},{"lastName":"Augustine","initials":"GJ","foreName":"George J"},{"lastName":"Choi","initials":"KW","foreName":"Kwang-Wook"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16863,"articleTitle":"A dominant gain-of-function mutation in universal tyrosine kinase SRC causes thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis, bleeding, and bone pathologies.","dateCreated":"2016-03-03","dateRevised":"2017-10-06","publication":{"issnNumber":"1946-6242","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Science translational medicine","isoAbbreviation":"Sci Transl Med"},"articleDate":"2016-03-02","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Src family kinase (SFK) member SRC is a major target in drug development because it is activated in many human cancers, yet deleterious SRC germline mutations have not been reported.

Modeling of the E527K substitution predicts loss of SRC's self-inhibitory capacity, which we confirmed with in vitro studies showing increased SRC kinase activity and enhanced Tyr(419) phosphorylation in COS-7 cells overexpressing E527K SRC. The active form of SRC predominates in patients' platelets, resulting in enhanced overall tyrosine phosphorylation. Patients with myelofibrosis have hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage dysplasia, and their stem cells grown in vitro form more myeloid and megakaryocyte (MK) colonies than control cells. These MKs generate platelets that are dysmorphic, low in number, highly variable in size, and have a paucity of α-granules. Overactive SRC in patient-derived MKs causes a reduction in proplatelet formation, which can be rescued by SRC kinase inhibition. Stem cells transduced with lentiviral E527K SRC form MKs with a similar defect and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Patient-derived and E527K-transduced MKs show Y419 SRC-positive stained podosomes that induce altered actin organization.

We have developed visually interactive, analytically transparent analysis software that leverages existing disease catalogs, such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM) and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), to integrate patient phenotype and variant data into ranked diagnostic alternatives.Our tool, \"OMIM Explorer\" ( http://www.omimexplorer.com ), extends the biomedical application of semantic similarity methods beyond those reported in previous studies. The tool also provides a simple interface for translating free-text clinical notes into HPO terms, enabling clinical providers and geneticists to contribute phenotypes to the diagnostic process. The visual approach uses semantic similarity with multidimensional scaling to collapse high-dimensional phenotype and genotype data from an individual into a graphical format that contextualizes the patient within a low-dimensional disease map. The map proposes a differential diagnosis and algorithmically suggests potential alternatives for phenotype queries--in essence, generating a computationally assisted differential diagnosis informed by the individual's personal genome. Visual interactivity allows the user to filter and update variant rankings by interacting with intermediate results. The tool also implements an adaptive approach for disease gene discovery based on patient phenotypes.We retrospectively analyzed pilot cohort data from the Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratory, demonstrating performance of the tool and workflow in the re-analysis of clinical exomes.

It has been established that desaturases need flavoprotein-NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase (simplified as cytochrome b5 reductase) and cytochrome b5 to pass through electrons for activation. However, it has remained unclear how this multi-enzyme system works for distinct desaturases. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans contains seven desaturases (FAT-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7) for the biosynthesis of PUFAS, providing an excellent model in which to characterize different desaturation reactions. Here, we show that RNAi inactivation of predicted cytochrome b5 reductases hpo-19 and T05H4.4 led to increased levels of C18:1n-9 but decreased levels of PUFAs, small lipid droplets, decreased fat accumulation, reduced brood size and impaired development. Dietary supplementation with different fatty acids showed that HPO-19 and T05H4.4 likely affect the activity of FAT-1, FAT-2, FAT-3, and FAT-4 desaturases, suggesting that these four desaturases use the same cytochrome b5 reductase to function. Collectively, these findings indicate that cytochrome b5 reductase HPO-19/T05H4.4 is required for desaturation to biosynthesize PUFAs in C. elegans.","PMID":26806391,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuru"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"H","foreName":"Haizhen"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jingjing"},{"lastName":"Hu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Ying"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"L","foreName":"Linqiang"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaoyun"},{"lastName":"Su","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiong"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"T","foreName":"Tingting"},{"lastName":"Zou","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaoju"},{"lastName":"Liang","initials":"B","foreName":"Bin"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16832,"articleTitle":"Anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics for managing symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis-related arthritis.","dateCreated":"2016-02-01","dateRevised":"2016-06-02","publication":{"issnNumber":"1469-493X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","isoAbbreviation":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev"},"articleDate":"2016-01-21","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Arthritis remains a relatively infrequent complication of cystic fibrosis, but is a cause of significant morbidity when it does occur. Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis-related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO). Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. This is an update of a previously published review.To review the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis-related arthritis in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of most recent search: 19 January 2016.Randomised controlled studies which compared the efficacy and safety of anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, systemic corticosteroids, intra-articular corticosteroids) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for CFA and HPO.No relevant studies were identified.No studies were included in this review.Although it is generally recognised that CFA may be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents may be needed. While this approach may be sufficient to manage symptoms, it is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these agents were found, nor could the authors identify any quasi-randomised. This systematic review has identified the need for a well-designed adequately-powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis-related arthritis (CFA and HPO) in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Studies should also better define the two conditions. A study has recently been conducted in CFA and may help fill this gap when analysed and published.There are no trials included in the review up to January 2016. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant studies; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new studies are published.","PMID":26798057,"authors":[{"lastName":"Thornton","initials":"J","foreName":"Judith"},{"lastName":"Rangaraj","initials":"S","foreName":"Satyapal"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17016,"articleTitle":"A whole genome approach to platelet and bleeding disorders.","dateCreated":"2016-08-03","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"0720-9355","issnType":"Print","title":"Hamostaseologie","isoAbbreviation":"Hamostaseologie"},"articleDate":"2016-01-19","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The sequencing of hundreds of thousands of human exomes and hundreds of thousands of whole genomes is providing a progressively accurate and complete catalogue of human genetic variation.

Chloroquine acts by forming toxic complexes with haem molecules and interfering with their crystallization. In chloroquine-resistant strains, the drug is excluded from the site of action, which causes the parasites to accumulate less chloroquine in their acid food vacuoles than chloroquine-sensitive parasites. 3-Hydroxylpyridin-4-ones are known to chelate iron; hydroxypyridone-chloroquine (HPO-CQ) hybrids were synthesized in order to determine whether they can inhibit parasites proliferation in the parasitic digestive vacuole by withholding iron from plasmodial parasite metabolic pathway.Two HPO-CQ hybrids were tested against Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-sensitive (D10 and 3D7) and -resistant strains (Dd2 and K1). The pharmacokinetic properties of active compounds were determined using a mouse model and blood samples were collected at different time intervals and analysed using LC-MS/MS. For in vivo efficacy the mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei in a 4-day Peters' test. The parasitaemia was determined from day 3 and the course of the infection was followed by microscopic examination of stained blood films every 2-3 days until a rise in parasitaemia was observed in all test subjects.IC50 values of the two compounds for sensitive and resistant strains were 0.064 and 0.047 µM (compound 1), 0.041 and 0.122 µM (compound 2) and 0.505 and 0.463 µM (compound 1), 0.089 and 0.076 µM (compound 2), respectively. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of these compounds showed low oral bioavailability and this affected in vivo efficacy when compounds were dosed orally. However, when dosed intravenously compound 1 showed a clearance rate of 28 ml/min/kg, an apparent volume of distribution of 20 l/kg and a half-life of 4.3 h. A reduction in parasitaemia was observed when compound 1 was dosed intravenously for four consecutive days in P. berghei-infected mice. However, a rise in parasitaemia levels was observed on day 6 and on day 9 for chloroquine-treated mice.The hybrid compounds that were tested were able to reduce parasitaemia levels in P. berghei-infected mice when dosed intravenously, but parasites recrudesced 24 h after the administration of the least dose. Despite low oral bioavailability, the IV data obtained suggests that further structural modifications may lead to the identification of more HPO-CQ hybrids with improved pharmacokinetic properties and in vivo efficacy.","PMID":26671222,"authors":[{"lastName":"Dambuza","initials":"NS","foreName":"Ntokozo S"},{"lastName":"Smith","initials":"P","foreName":"Peter"},{"lastName":"Evans","initials":"A","foreName":"Alicia"},{"lastName":"Norman","initials":"J","foreName":"Jennifer"},{"lastName":"Taylor","initials":"D","foreName":"Dale"},{"lastName":"Andayi","initials":"A","foreName":"Andrew"},{"lastName":"Egan","initials":"T","foreName":"Timothy"},{"lastName":"Chibale","initials":"K","foreName":"Kelly"},{"lastName":"Wiesner","initials":"L","foreName":"Lubbe"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16837,"articleTitle":"A 2-Hydroxypyridine Catabolism Pathway in Rhodococcus rhodochrous Strain PY11.","dateCreated":"2016-02-06","dateRevised":"2016-12-30","publication":{"issnNumber":"1098-5336","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Applied and environmental microbiology","isoAbbreviation":"Appl.

Only in the presence of slow reacting DOM (from treated Colorado River water, i.e., CRW-BF-HPO), significant BrO3(-) formation is observed, which competes with bromination of DOM (i.e., THM and HAA formation). Reactions between HOBr and 12 model compounds in the presence of CuO indicates that CuO-catalyzed HOBr disproportionation is completely inhibited by fast reacting phenols, while it predominates in the presence of practically unreactive compounds (acetone, butanol, propionic, and butyric acids). In the presence of slow reacting di- and tricarboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, succinic, and citric acids), BrO3(-) formation varies, depending on its competition with bromoform and dibromoacetic acid formation (i.e., bromination pathway). The latter pathway can be enhanced by CuO due to the activation of HOBr. Therefore, increasing CuO dose (0-0.2 g L(-1)) in a reaction system containing chlorine, bromide, and CRW-BF-HPO enhances the formation of BrO3(-), total THMs and HAAs.

Genetic tests, genetic disorders and clinical features with their odds ratios have been applied to establish iGTKB, which is to be integrated into the Genetic Testing Ontology (GTO).Overall, there are five genetic tests operated with sample size greater than 100 in 2013 at Mayo Clinic. A total of 1,450 patients who was tested by one of the five genetic tests have been selected. We assembled 243 clinical features from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for these five genetic tests. There are 60 clinical features with at least one mention in clinical notes of patients taking the test. Twenty-eight clinical features with high odds ratio (greater than 1) have been selected as dominant features and deposited into iGTKB with their associated information about genetic tests and genetic disorders.In this study, we developed an EHR based genetic testing knowledge base, iGTKB. iGTKB will be integrated into the GTO by providing relevant clinical evidence, and ultimately to support development of genetic testing recommendation system, iGenetics.","PMID":26606281,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhu","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qian"},{"lastName":"Liu","initials":"H","foreName":"Hongfang"},{"lastName":"Chute","initials":"CG","foreName":"Christopher G"},{"lastName":"Ferber","initials":"M","foreName":"Matthew"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16764,"articleTitle":"Synthesis of polymers containing 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one bidentate ligands for treatment of iron overload.","dateCreated":"2015-11-25","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1735-5362","issnType":"Print","title":"Research in pharmaceutical sciences","isoAbbreviation":"Res Pharm Sci"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Iron overload is a clinical problem which can be prevented by using iron chelating agents. An alternative method of relieving iron overload is to reduce iron absorption from the intestine by administering specific iron chelating agents, which can bind iron to form nonabsorbable complexes. Based on this strategy, a series of polymeric ligands containing the chelating moiety 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones (HPOs) were synthesized. The synthetic route involves the benzylation of hydroxyl group of (2-methyl-3-hydroxypyran-4-one (maltol) and conversion of benzylated maltol to 3-benzyloxypyridin-4-one derivatives by using three suitable primary amines (2,6-diaminohexanoic acid (lysine) and 1,6-diaminohexane and 5-aminopentanol). The resulted compounds incorporated into polymer by copolymerization with acryloyl chloride using 2, 2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator. Finally, the benzyl groups of polymers were removed by catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C).

These oriented cell divisions are essential for the development of cell diversity and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Despite intense efforts, the molecular mechanisms that control spindle orientation remain incompletely defined. Here, we describe a role for the Hippo (Hpo) kinase complex in promoting Partner of Inscuteable (Pins)-mediated spindle orientation. Knockdown of Hpo, Salvador (Sav), or Warts (Wts) each result in a partial loss of spindle orientation, a phenotype previously described following loss of the Pins-binding protein Mushroom body defect (Mud). Similar to orthologs spanning yeast to mammals, Wts kinase localizes to mitotic spindle poles, a prominent site of Mud localization. Wts directly phosphorylates Mud in vitro within its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. This Mud coiled-coil domain directly binds the adjacent Pins-binding domain to dampen the Pins/Mud interaction, and Wts-mediated phosphorylation uncouples this intramolecular Mud interaction. Loss of Wts prevents cortical Pins/Mud association without affecting Mud accumulation at spindle poles, suggesting phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch to specifically activate cortical Mud function. Finally, loss of Wts in Drosophila imaginal disc epithelial cells results in diminished cortical Mud and defective planar spindle orientation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular basis for dynamic regulation of the cortical Pins/Mud spindle positioning complex and highlight a novel link with an essential, evolutionarily conserved cell proliferation pathway.","PMID":26592339,"authors":[{"lastName":"Dewey","initials":"EB","foreName":"Evan B"},{"lastName":"Sanchez","initials":"D","foreName":"Desiree"},{"lastName":"Johnston","initials":"CA","foreName":"Christopher A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16762,"articleTitle":"The hippo pathway core cassette regulates asymmetric cell division.","dateCreated":"2015-11-23","dateRevised":"2017-08-27","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0445","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

Stem and progenitor cells divide asymmetrically, giving rise to two daughter cells, one of which retains the parent cell self-renewal capacity, while the other is committed to differentiation. Any imbalance in this process can induce overgrowth or even a cancer-like state. Here, we show that core components of the Hippo signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved organ growth regulator, modulate ACD in Drosophila. Hippo pathway inactivation disrupts the asymmetric localization of ACD regulators, leading to aberrant mitotic spindle orientation and defects in the generation of unequal-sized daughter cells.

The mechanisms responsible for localization of H3K27me are largely unknown, perhaps in part because of the complexity of epigenetic regulatory networks. We used a relatively simple model organism bearing both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin, Neurospora crassa, to explore possible interactions between elements of heterochromatin. In higher eukaryotes, reductions of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation in constitutive heterochromatin have been variously reported to cause redistribution of H3K27me3. In Neurospora, we found that elimination of any member of the DCDC H3K9 methylation complex caused massive changes in the distribution of H3K27me; regions of facultative heterochromatin lost H3K27me3, while regions that are normally marked by H3K9me3 became methylated at H3K27. Elimination of DNA methylation had no obvious effect on the distribution of H3K27me. Elimination of HP1, which \"reads\" H3K9me3, also caused major changes in the distribution of H3K27me, indicating that HP1 is important for normal localization of facultative heterochromatin. Because loss of HP1 caused redistribution of H3K27me2/3, but not H3K9me3, these normally nonoverlapping marks became superimposed. Indeed, mass spectrometry revealed substantial cohabitation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me2 on H3 molecules from an hpo strain. Loss of H3K27me machinery (e.g., the methyltransferase SET-7) did not impact constitutive heterochromatin but partially rescued the slow growth of the DCDC mutants, suggesting that the poor growth of these mutants is partly attributable to ectopic H3K27me.

The transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki, a YES-Associated Protein, or YAP) acts downstream of patterning morphogens and other tissue-intrinsic signals to promote organ growth. Yki activity is regulated primarily by the Warts/Hippo (Wts/Hpo) tumour suppressor pathway, which impedes nuclear access of Yki by a cytoplasmic tethering mechanism. Here, we show that the TOR pathway regulates Yki by a separate and novel mechanism in the Drosophila wing. Instead of controlling Yki nuclear access, TOR signaling governs Yki action after it reaches the nucleus by allowing it to gain access to its target genes. When TOR activity is inhibited, Yki accumulates in the nucleus but is sequestered from its normal growth-promoting target genes--a phenomenon we term \"nuclear seclusion.\" Hence, we posit that in addition to its well-known role in stimulating cellular metabolism in response to nutrients, TOR also promotes wing growth by liberating Yki from nuclear seclusion, a parallel pathway that we propose contributes to the scaling of wing size with nutrient availability.","PMID":26474042,"authors":[{"lastName":"Parker","initials":"J","foreName":"Joseph"},{"lastName":"Struhl","initials":"G","foreName":"Gary"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16722,"articleTitle":"Fluoride Exposure, Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor Gene Polymorphism and Hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian Axis Hormones in Chinese Women.","dateCreated":"2015-10-14","dateRevised":"2015-10-14","publication":{"issnNumber":"0895-3988","issnType":"Print","title":"Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES","isoAbbreviation":"Biomed.

We used 2 human pancreatic cancer cell lines to explore this hypothesis: one with the capacity to form functional tight junction structures and polarize (HPAFII) and one lacking this capacity (AsPc1). Occludin (Ocln), a tetraspanning protein associated with TJ structures and capable of establishing external cell-cell contacts, was observed to partially co-localize with Hpo elements YAP (c-yes associated protein) and TEAD (TEA-dependent), which function to drive a proliferative transcription program. Treatment with dobutamine, known to affect YAP, was shown to suppress proliferation in an Ocln-dependent manner. Blockade of protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-ζ) diminished transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of HPAFII monolayers that was not corrected by dobutamine treatment while the loss of TER resulting from inhibition of ROCK1 could be partially recovered. Examination of normal and cancerous human pancreatic biopsies showed that the cellular localization of Ocln, c-Yes, YAP, and TEAD were similar to HPAFII for normal cells and AsPc1 for cancerous cells.

Female quails were dosed by oral gavage from sexual immaturity to maturity with 0, 50, 250 and 500 mg ATR/kg/d for 45 days. ATR had no effect on mortality but depressed feed intake and growth and influenced the biochemical parameters. Notably, the arrested development of ovaries and oviducts were observed in ATR-exposed quails. The circulating concentrations of E2, P, LH and PRL were unregulated and FSH and T was downregulated in ATR-treated quails. The mRNA expression of GnRH in hypothalamo and LH in pituitary and FSH in ovary was downregulated significantly by ATR exposure and FSH and PRL in pituitary were upregulated. ATR exposure upregulated the level of P450scc, P450arom, 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD in ovary and downregulated ERβ expression in female quails. However, ATR did not change ERα expression in ovary. This study provides new insights regarding female productive toxicology of ATR exposure. Ovary and oviduct in sexually maturing females were target organs of ATR-induced developmental toxicity.

We found that Hedgehog (Hh) signals emanating primarily from cap cells support the function of ECs, where Cubitus interruptus (Ci), the Hh signaling effector, acts to inhibit Hippo kinase cascade activity.

How new membrane and associated cargo is delivered from the secretory and endosomal compartments to sites of active dendritic growth, however, remains unknown. Using a candidate-based genetic screen in C. elegans, we have identified the small GTPase RAB-10 as a key regulator of membrane trafficking during dendrite morphogenesis. Loss of rab-10 severely reduced proximal dendritic arborization in the multi-dendritic PVD neuron. RAB-10 acts cell-autonomously in the PVD neuron and localizes to the Golgi and early endosomes. Loss of function mutations of the exocyst complex components exoc-8 and sec-8, which regulate tethering, docking and fusion of transport vesicles at the plasma membrane, also caused proximal dendritic arborization defects and led to the accumulation of intracellular RAB-10 vesicles. In rab-10 and exoc-8 mutants, the trans-membrane proteins DMA-1 and HPO-30, which promote PVD dendrite stabilization and branching, no longer localized strongly to the proximal dendritic membranes and instead were sequestered within intracellular vesicles. Together these results suggest a crucial role for the Rab10 GTPase and the exocyst complex in controlling membrane transport from the secretory and/or endosomal compartments that is required for dendritic growth.","PMID":26394140,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zou","initials":"W","foreName":"Wei"},{"lastName":"Yadav","initials":"S","foreName":"Smita"},{"lastName":"DeVault","initials":"L","foreName":"Laura"},{"lastName":"Nung Jan","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuh"},{"lastName":"Sherwood","initials":"DR","foreName":"David R"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16697,"articleTitle":"SORTA: a system for ontology-based re-coding and technical annotation of biomedical phenotype data.","dateCreated":"2015-09-19","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1758-0463","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Database : the journal of biological databases and curation","isoAbbreviation":"Database (Oxford)"},"articleDate":"2015-09-18","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"There is an urgent need to standardize the semantics of biomedical data values, such as phenotypes, to enable comparative and integrative analyses. However, it is unlikely that all studies will use the same data collection protocols. As a result, retrospective standardization is often required, which involves matching of original (unstructured or locally coded) data to widely used coding or ontology systems such as SNOMED CT (clinical terms), ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease) and HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology). This data curation process is usually a time-consuming process performed by a human expert. To help mechanize this process, we have developed SORTA, a computer-aided system for rapidly encoding free text or locally coded values to a formal coding system or ontology. SORTA matches original data values (uploaded in semicolon delimited format) to a target coding system (uploaded in Excel spreadsheet, OWL ontology web language or OBO open biomedical ontologies format). It then semi- automatically shortlists candidate codes for each data value using Lucene and n-gram based matching algorithms, and can also learn from matches chosen by human experts. We evaluated SORTA's applicability in two use cases. For the LifeLines biobank, we used SORTA to recode 90\u2009000 free text values (including 5211 unique values) about physical exercise to MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) codes. For the CINEAS clinical symptom coding system, we used SORTA to map to HPO, enriching HPO when necessary (315 terms matched so far). Out of the shortlists at rank 1, we found a precision/recall of 0.97/0.98 in LifeLines and of 0.58/0.45 in CINEAS. More importantly, users found the tool both a major time saver and a quality improvement because SORTA reduced the chances of human mistakes. Thus, SORTA can dramatically ease data (re)coding tasks and we believe it will prove useful for many more projects.

Yki activity is restricted through phosphorylation by the Hpo/Warts core kinase cascade, but increasing evidence indicates that core kinase-independent modes of regulation also play an important role. Here, we examine Yki regulation in the Drosophila larval central nervous system and uncover a Hpo/Warts-independent function for the tumor suppressor kinase liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and its downstream effector, the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in repressing Yki activity in the central brain/ventral nerve cord. Although the Hpo/Warts core cascade restrains Yki in the optic lobe, it is dispensable for Yki target gene repression in the late larval central brain/ventral nerve cord.

Filter samples were analyzed for OC, elemental carbon (EC), WSOC, hydrophilic and hydrophobic WSOC fractions (WSOC(HPI) and WSOC(HPO)), and ionic species. An XAD solid phase extraction method and a total organic carbon analyzer were used to isolate the two WSOC fractions and determine their amounts, respectively. The WSOC/OC and WSOC(HPI)/WSOC ratios were 0.62±0.13 and 0.47±0.14, respectively. Similar seasonal profiles in EC, OC, and WSOC concentrations were observed, with higher concentrations occurring in the cold season and lower concentrations in the warm season. However, opposite results were obtained in WSOC/OC and WSOC(HPI)/WSOC ratios, with the higher in the warm season and the lower in the cold season. Correlation analyses indicated that two WSOC fractions in winter were likely attributed to secondary formation processes, biomass burning (BB), and traffic emissions, while WSOC(HPI) observed in other seasons were associated with secondary formation processes similar to those of oxalate and secondary inorganic species. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was employed to investigate the sources of two WSOC fractions. PMF indicated that concentrations of WSOC fractions were affected by five sources: secondary NO3(-) related, secondary SO4(2-) and oxalate related, traffic emissions, BB emissions, and sea-salt. Throughout the study period, secondary organic aerosols were estimated to be the most dominant contributor of WSOC fractions, with higher contributions occurring in the warm seasons. The contribution of secondary aerosol formation processes (NO3(-) related+SO4(2-) and oxalate related) to WSOC(HPI) and WSOC(HPO) was on an average 56.2% (45.0-73.8%) and 47.7% (39.6-52.1%), respectively. The seasonal average contribution of WSOC(HPI) and WSOC(HPO) attributed to BB was 19.0% (14.3-25.3%) and 14.8% (7.2-19.5%), respectively, with higher fractions occurring in the fall and winter. Traffic sources contributed to WSOC(HPI) and WSOC(HPO) from 4.2 to 21.0% (an average of 11.6%) and from 7.9 to 32.3% (an average of 19.9%), respectively, with higher fractions in the fall and winter compared with the other seasons. During the study period, for an episode associated with high local O3 level (~110 ppbv) and high WSOC(HPI)/WSOC (0.80), secondary formation processes contributed 67.1% to WSOCHPI, and 72.6% to WSOC(HPO), respectively. However, for an episode associated with local and severe regional haze pollutions, contributions of secondary formation processes to WSOC fractions were observed to be low (32.4-43.1%), while traffic and BB emissions contributed 16.8% and 24.3% to WSOC(HPI), respectively, and 18.3% and 18.7% to WSOC(HPO), respectively. The PMF results suggest that the contribution of traffic emissions to concentrations of two WSOC fractions cannot be neglected at the studied roadway site.","PMID":26184904,"authors":[{"lastName":"Park","initials":"S","foreName":"Seungshik"},{"lastName":"Cho","initials":"SY","foreName":"Sung Yong"},{"lastName":"Bae","initials":"MS","foreName":"Min-Suk"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16666,"articleTitle":"Scalloped and Yorkie are required for cell cycle re-entry of quiescent cells after tissue damage.","dateCreated":"2015-08-19","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1477-9129","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Development (Cambridge, England)","isoAbbreviation":"Development"},"articleDate":"2015-07-09","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Regeneration of damaged tissues typically requires a population of active stem cells.

Ajuba, an upstream regulator of Hippo signaling that functions as a sensor of epithelial integrity, is also required for cell cycle re-entry.

In particular, the stability of scaffold protein Salvador (Sav), which is believed to promote Hpo/Wts association, is crucially dependent on its binding partner Hpo. In a cell-based RNAi screen for ubiquitin regulators involved in Sav stability, we identify the HECT domain protein Herc4 (HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ligase) as a Sav E3 ligase. Herc4 expression promotes Sav ubiquitylation and degradation, while Herc4 depletion stabilises Sav. Interestingly, Hpo reduces Sav/Herc4 interaction in a kinase-dependent manner.

Moreover, we find that Lig physically interacts with and requires Salvador to restrict cell growth. Taken together, we demonstrate that Lig functions as a critical growth suppressor to control organ size via ban and Hippo signaling.","PMID":26117838,"authors":[{"lastName":"Dong","initials":"L","foreName":"Liang"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"J","foreName":"Jinhui"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"H","foreName":"Hongling"},{"lastName":"Yin","initials":"MX","foreName":"Meng-Xin"},{"lastName":"Xu","initials":"J","foreName":"Jinjin"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"P","foreName":"Peixue"},{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yi"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"W","foreName":"Wenqing"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"H","foreName":"Hang"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yun"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"L","foreName":"Lei"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16610,"articleTitle":"An Unusual Mimicker of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Case Report.","dateCreated":"2015-06-24","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1874-3129","issnType":"Print","title":"The open rheumatology journal","isoAbbreviation":"Open Rheumatol J"},"articleDate":"2015-06-12","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We present a case of a 47 year-old African American female with 15 pack-years of tobacco use and heavy alcohol use who presented with arthritis and was found to have a positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti double stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), and anti-Sjogren's syndrome-related antigen A and antigen B (anti-SSA and anti-SSB).

We conducted a review of current literature using Pubmed and MedLine as our primary databases, as well as providing commentary considering work up, treatment and follow-up of our DUB patients. Insufficient progesterone production and subsequent abnormal shedding of the endometrium appears to orchestrate the pathophysiology of DUB in adolescence. Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis immaturity right after menarche, is usually the most plausible cause. Nevertheless, it is necessary to exclude other, possibly even life-threatening causes. Complete work up including physical examination, laboratory and imaging studies (complete blood count, b-HCG, hormonal levels and ultrasonography) is needed, and appropriate treatment with combined oral contraceptives is administered accordingly. Although menstrual disorders are very common in early adolescence, a severe episode of DUB should always be thoroughly attended by any physician. Follow-up should be offered in all young patients due to high incidence of recurrence or subsequent development of endocrine disorders such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).","PMID":26054370,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deligeoroglou","initials":"EK","foreName":"E K"},{"lastName":"Creatsas","initials":"GK","foreName":"G K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16588,"articleTitle":"Control of organ growth by patterning and hippo signaling in Drosophila.","dateCreated":"2015-06-02","dateRevised":"2017-03-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1943-0264","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology","isoAbbreviation":"Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol"},"articleDate":"2015-06-01","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Control of organ size is of fundamental importance and is controlled by genetic, environmental, and mechanical factors.

The influence of morphogens and other patterning molecules couples growth and patterning, whereas emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway controls growth in response to mechanical stimuli and signals emanating from cell-cell interactions. Several points of cross talk have been reported between signaling pathways that control organ patterning and the Hippo pathway, both at the level of membrane receptors and transcriptional regulators. However, despite substantial progress in the past decade, key questions in the growth-control field remain, including precisely how and when organ patterning and the Hippo pathway communicate to control size, and whether these communication mechanisms are organ specific or general.

The adhesion and cohesion interactions of EPS fractions and membranes could explain the different rejection rates of the EPS components.

Stress signaling pathways activate multiple cellular programs that range from the activation of survival pathways to the initiation of cell death when cells are damaged beyond repair. To identify novel players acting in stress response pathways, we conducted a cell culture RNA interference (RNAi) screen using caffeine as a xenobiotic stress-inducing agent, as this compound is a well-established inducer of detoxification response pathways. Specifically, we examined how caffeine affects cell survival when Drosophila kinases and phosphatases were depleted via RNAi. Using this approach, we identified and validated 10 kinases and 4 phosphatases that are essential for cell survival under caffeine-induced stress both in cell culture and living flies. Remarkably, our screen yielded an enrichment of Hippo pathway components, indicating that this pathway regulates cellular stress responses. Indeed, we show that the Hippo pathway acts as a potent repressor of stress-induced cell death. Further, we demonstrate that Hippo activation is necessary to inhibit a pro-apoptotic program triggered by the interaction of the transcriptional co-activator Yki with the transcription factor p53 in response to a range of stress stimuli. Our in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function data therefore implicate Hippo signaling in the transduction of cellular survival signals in response to chemical stress.","PMID":26021298,"authors":[{"lastName":"Di Cara","initials":"F","foreName":"F"},{"lastName":"Maile","initials":"TM","foreName":"T M"},{"lastName":"Parsons","initials":"BD","foreName":"B D"},{"lastName":"Magico","initials":"A","foreName":"A"},{"lastName":"Basu","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Tapon","initials":"N","foreName":"N"},{"lastName":"King-Jones","initials":"K","foreName":"K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16601,"articleTitle":"JNK signaling is converted from anti- to pro-tumor pathway by Ras-mediated switch of Warts activity.","dateCreated":"2015-06-15","dateRevised":"2015-06-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"1095-564X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Developmental biology","isoAbbreviation":"Dev.

Here, using the Drosophila genetics, we show that hyperactive Ras acts as a signaling switch that converts JNK's role from anti- to pro-tumor signaling through the regulation of Hippo signaling activity. In the normal epithelium, JNK signaling antagonizes the Hippo pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) through elevation of Warts activity, thereby suppressing tissue growth. In contrast, in the presence of hyperactive Ras, JNK signaling enhances Yki activation by accumulating F-actin through the activity of the LIM domain protein Ajuba, thereby promoting tissue growth. We also find that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling uses this Ras-mediated conversion of JNK signaling to promote tissue growth. Our observations suggest that Ras-mediated switch of the JNK pathway from anti- to pro-tumor signaling could play crucial roles in tumorigenesis as well as in normal development.","PMID":25967126,"authors":[{"lastName":"Enomoto","initials":"M","foreName":"Masato"},{"lastName":"Kizawa","initials":"D","foreName":"Daisuke"},{"lastName":"Ohsawa","initials":"S","foreName":"Shizue"},{"lastName":"Igaki","initials":"T","foreName":"Tatsushi"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16562,"articleTitle":"Human phenotype ontology annotation and cluster analysis to unravel genetic defects in 707 cases with unexplained bleeding and platelet disorders.","dateCreated":"2015-05-07","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1756-994X","issnType":"Print","title":"Genome medicine","isoAbbreviation":"Genome Med"},"articleDate":"2015-04-09","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Heritable bleeding and platelet disorders (BPD) are heterogeneous and frequently have an unknown genetic basis.

Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the sheep CCNG1 protein contained multiple phosphorylation sites and some Protein Kinase C phosphorylation sites. CCNG1 mRNA was identified in all tissues tested, with the levels in ovary and kidney higher than others. The expression profiles of CCNG1 in the HPO axis in different stages of an estrous cycle were similar in different sheep breeds: the expression levels of CCNG1 in the ovary, uterus, pineal gland and pituitary gland all peaked in the estrus phase. But there were significant differences for expression change extent of CCNG1 in ovaries in the oestrus and metestrus phase between different sheep breeds.

Strikingly, chloroquine also rescued the lgl(-) overgrowth phenotype, suggesting that the Hippo pathway defects were also rescued. In this extraview, we provide additional data on the regulation of Notch signaling and endocytosis by Lgl, and discuss possible mechanisms by which Lgl depletion contributes to signaling pathway defects and tumorigenesis.","PMID":25789785,"authors":[{"lastName":"Portela","initials":"M","foreName":"Marta"},{"lastName":"Parsons","initials":"LM","foreName":"Linda M"},{"lastName":"Grzeschik","initials":"NA","foreName":"Nicola A"},{"lastName":"Richardson","initials":"HE","foreName":"Helena E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16512,"articleTitle":"Growth control: re-examining Zyxin's role in the hippo pathway.","dateCreated":"2015-03-18","dateRevised":"2015-03-18","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0445","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

The molecular oscillator driving these rhythms has been localized to tissues of the HPO axis. It has been suggested that synchrony among these oscillators is a feature of normal reproductive function. The impact of fertility disorders on clock function and the role of the clock in the etiology of endocrine pathology remain unknown. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating fertility disorder, affecting 5%-10% of women at childbearing age with features including a polycystic ovary, anovulation, and elevated serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, marked by hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. It has been suggested that developmental exposure to excess androgen contributes to the etiology of fertility disorders, including PCOS. To better define the role of the timing system in these disorders, we determined the effects of androgen-dependent developmental programming on clock gene expression in tissues of the metabolic and HPO axes. Female PERIOD2::luciferase (PER2::LUC) mice were exposed to androgen (dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) in utero (Days 16-18 of gestation) or for 9-10 wk (DHT pellet) beginning at weaning (pubertal androgen excess [PAE]). As expected, both groups of androgen-treated mice had disrupted estrous cycles. Analysis of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants revealed that excess androgen produced circadian misalignment via tissue-dependent effects on phase distribution. In vitro treatment with DHT differentially affected the period of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants and granulosa cells, indicating that androgen has direct and tissue-specific effects on clock gene expression that may account for the effects of developmental programming on the timing system.","PMID":25695720,"authors":[{"lastName":"Mereness","initials":"AL","foreName":"Amanda L"},{"lastName":"Murphy","initials":"ZC","foreName":"Zachary C"},{"lastName":"Sellix","initials":"MT","foreName":"Michael T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16485,"articleTitle":"NEDD4 controls intestinal stem cell homeostasis by regulating the Hippo signalling pathway.","dateCreated":"2015-02-19","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"2041-1723","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nature communications","isoAbbreviation":"Nat Commun"},"articleDate":"2015-02-18","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Hippo pathway plays crucial roles in regulating organ size and stem cell homeostasis.

Loss of AJs or basolateral polarity components promotes tumor formation and metastasis. Recent studies in vertebrate models show that loss of AJs or loss of the basolateral component Scribble (Scrib) cause deregulation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway and hyperactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). However, whether AJs and Scrib act through the same or independent mechanisms to regulate Hippo pathway activity is not known. Here, we dissect how disruption of AJs or loss of basolateral components affect the activity of the Drosophila YAP homolog Yorkie (Yki) during imaginal disc development. Surprisingly, disruption of AJs and loss of basolateral proteins produced very different effects on Yki activity. Yki activity was cell-autonomously decreased but non-cell-autonomously elevated in tissues where the AJ components E-cadherin (E-cad) or α-catenin (α-cat) were knocked down. In contrast, scrib knockdown caused a predominantly cell-autonomous activation of Yki. Moreover, disruption of AJs or basolateral proteins had different effects on cell polarity and tissue size.

In this study, thermodynamic calculations of uranium speciation in relevant simulated and original body fluids were compared with spectroscopic data after ex-situ uranium addition. For the first time, experimental data on U(VI) speciation in body fluids (saliva, sweat, urine) was obtained by means of cryogenic time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (cryo-TRLFS) at 153 K. By using the time dependency of fluorescence decay and the band positions of the emission spectra, various uranyl complexes were demonstrated in the studied samples. The variations of the body fluids in terms of chemical composition, pH, and ionic strength resulted in different binding forms of U(VI). The speciation of U(VI) in saliva and in urine was affected by the presence of bioorganic ligands, whereas in sweat, the distribution depends mainly on inorganic ligands. We also elucidated the role of biological buffers, i.e., phosphate (H(2)PO(4−)/HPO(4)(2−)) on U(VI) distribution, and the system Ca(2+)/UO(2)(2+)/PO(4)(3−) was discussed in detail in both saliva and urine.

Due to the poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options, there is great interest in further understanding better the molecular underpinnings and potential molecular targets associated with HCC. The Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway and YAP, its principal downstream effector, represent an innovative area of research in HCC. Pioneered in Drosophila melanogaster, the Hpo cascade controls tissue homeostasis including organ size, cell proliferation, apoptosis, as well as cell-cycle regulation and differentiation. This conserved kinase cascade in mammals depends on central control by the tumor suppressor mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1/2 (Mst1/2). The Mst1/2 commences the downstream kinase cascade, ultimately activating the oncoprotein YAP and allowing its physical association with downstream targets to enhance the gene expression signatures that are involved in proliferation and survival. Alterations in YAP expression and defective regulation of other key Hpo pathway members, such as Mst1/2, Salvador, neurofibromatosis and Mer (Nf2/mer), large tumor suppressor homolog 1/2 (Lats1/2), and Mps one binder kinase activator-like 1A and 1B (Mob1) drive carcinogenesis in animal models. The dysregulation of the Hpo pathway - resulting in an unchecked activation of YAP - culminates in the development of a broad range of human tumor types, including HCC. The abrogation of Mst1/2-mediated YAP phosphorylation permits YAP entry into the nucleus in murine models and functions similarly in human HCCs. Chemoresistance mechanisms displayed by HCC tumors occur in a YAP-dependent manner. The HCC specimens exhibit YAP overexpression, and YAP serves as an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with HCC. Recently, the small molecule inhibitor, verteporfin has been shown to attenuate YAP activity in murine models, perhaps offering a novel therapeutic approach for patients with advanced HCC.","PMID":27508196,"authors":[{"lastName":"Valero","initials":"V","foreName":"Vicente"},{"lastName":"Pawlik","initials":"TM","foreName":"Timothy M"},{"lastName":"Anders","initials":"RA","foreName":"Robert A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17009,"articleTitle":"Overlapping functions of the MAP4K family kinases Hppy and Msn in Hippo signaling.","dateCreated":"2016-07-27","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"2056-5968","issnType":"Print","title":"Cell discovery","isoAbbreviation":"Cell Discov"},"articleDate":"2015-11-24","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Hippo (Hpo) tumor suppressor pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls tissue growth and organ size in species ranging from Drosophila to human, and its malfunction has been implicated in many types of human cancer.

To address this, we used proteomics to identify proteins that bind to the Hippo (Hpo) kinase. Prominent among these were PAK-interacting exchange factor (known as Pix or RtGEF) and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein (Git). Pix is a conserved Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) homologous to Beta-PIX and Alpha-PIX in mammals.

Pix and Git form an oligomeric scaffold to facilitate sterile 20-like kinase activation and have also been linked to GTPase regulation. We show that Pix and Git regulate Hippo-pathway-dependent tissue growth in D. melanogaster and that they do this in parallel to the known upstream regulator Fat cadherin. Pix and Git influence activity of the Hpo kinase by acting as a scaffold complex, rather than enzymes, and promote Hpo dimerization and autophosphorylation of Hpo's activation loop.

It performs these functions in epithelial and neural tissues of both insects and mammals, as well as in mammalian organs such as the liver and heart. Despite rapid advances in Hippo pathway research, a definitive role for this pathway in hematopoiesis has remained enigmatic. The hematopoietic compartments of Drosophila melanogaster and mammals possess several conserved features. D. melanogaster possess three types of hematopoietic cells that most closely resemble mammalian myeloid cells: plasmatocytes (macrophage-like cells), crystal cells (involved in wound healing), and lamellocytes (which encapsulate parasites). The proteins that control differentiation of these cells also control important blood lineage decisions in mammals. Here, we define the Hippo pathway as a key mediator of hematopoiesis by showing that it controls differentiation and proliferation of the two major types of D. melanogaster blood cells, plasmatocytes and crystal cells. In animals lacking the downstream Hippo pathway kinase Warts, lymph gland cells overproliferated, differentiated prematurely, and often adopted a mixed lineage fate. The Hippo pathway regulated crystal cell numbers by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. Yorkie and its partner transcription factor Scalloped were found to regulate transcription of the Runx family transcription factor Lozenge, which is a key regulator of crystal cell fate. Further, Yorkie or Scalloped hyperactivation induced ectopic crystal cells in a non-cell-autonomous and Notch-pathway-dependent fashion.","PMID":25454587,"authors":[{"lastName":"Milton","initials":"CC","foreName":"Claire C"},{"lastName":"Grusche","initials":"FA","foreName":"Felix A"},{"lastName":"Degoutin","initials":"JL","foreName":"Joffrey L"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"E","foreName":"Eefang"},{"lastName":"Dai","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qi"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"EC","foreName":"Eric C"},{"lastName":"Harvey","initials":"KF","foreName":"Kieran F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16464,"articleTitle":"Ubiquitin E3 ligase dSmurf is essential for Wts protein turnover and Hippo signaling.","dateCreated":"2015-01-29","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1090-2104","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","isoAbbreviation":"Biochem.

Half reduction of the hpo gene dose reduced apoptosis in DREF-overexpressing flies. Consistent with these observations, overexpression of DREF increased the levels of hpo and phosphorylated Yorkie in eye discs. Interestingly, the diap1-lacZ reporter was seen to be significantly decreased by overexpression of DREF. Luciferase reporter assays in cultured S2 cells revealed that one of two DREs identified in the hpo gene promoter region was responsible for promoter activity in S2 cells. Furthermore, endogenous hpo mRNA was reduced in DREF knockdown S2 cells, and chromatin immnunoprecipitation assays with anti-DREF antibodies proved that DREF binds specifically to the hpo gene promoter region containing DREs in vivo.

This coordination is facilitated by the timing of gene expression and cellular physiology at each level of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, including the basal hypothalamus and forebrain, the pituitary gland, and the ovary. Central to this pathway is the primary circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that, through its myriad outputs, provides a temporal framework for gonadotropin release and ovulation. The heart of the timing system, a transcription-based oscillator, imparts SCN pacemaker cells and a company of peripheral tissues with the capacity for daily oscillations of gene expression and cellular physiology. Although the SCN sits comfortably at the helm, peripheral oscillators (such as the ovary) have undefined but potentially critical roles. Each cell type of the ovary, including theca cells, granulosa cells, and oocytes, harbor a molecular clock implicated in the processes of follicular growth, steroid hormone synthesis, and ovulation. The ovarian clock is influenced by the reproductive cycle and diseases that perturb the cycle and/or follicular growth can disrupt the timing of clock gene expression in the ovary. Chronodisruption is known to negatively affect reproductive function and fertility in both rodent models and women exposed to shiftwork schedules. Thus, influencing clock function in the HPO axis with chronobiotics may represent a novel avenue for the treatment of common fertility disorders, particularly those resulting from chronic circadian disruption.","PMID":25367899,"authors":[{"lastName":"Sellix","initials":"MT","foreName":"Michael T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16451,"articleTitle":"Disease Ontology 2015 update: an expanded and updated database of human diseases for linking biomedical knowledge through disease data.","dateCreated":"2015-01-16","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1362-4962","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nucleic acids research","isoAbbreviation":"Nucleic Acids Res."},"articleDate":"2014-10-27","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The current version of the Human Disease Ontology (DO) (http://www.disease-ontology.org) database expands the utility of the ontology for the examination and comparison of genetic variation, phenotype, protein, drug and epitope data through the lens of human disease.

Our genetic data indicate that dysfunction of Rab5 leads to cell-autonomous accumulation of Eiger (a TNF homolog) and EGF receptor (EGFR), which causes activation of downstream JNK and Ras signaling, respectively. JNK signaling and its downstream component Cdc42 cooperate with Ras signaling to induce upregulation of a secreted growth factor Upd (an IL-6 homolog) through inactivation of the Hippo pathway. Such non-autonomous tissue growth triggered by Rab5 defect could contribute to epithelial homeostasis as well as cancer development within heterogeneous tumor microenvironment.","PMID":25224221,"authors":[{"lastName":"Takino","initials":"K","foreName":"Kyoko"},{"lastName":"Ohsawa","initials":"S","foreName":"Shizue"},{"lastName":"Igaki","initials":"T","foreName":"Tatsushi"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16342,"articleTitle":"CYLD negatively regulates Hippo signaling by limiting Hpo phosphorylation in Drosophila.","dateCreated":"2014-09-29","dateRevised":"2014-09-29","publication":{"issnNumber":"1090-2104","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","isoAbbreviation":"Biochem.

Although great progress has been made in the biochemical and cellular functions of CYLD, its role in animal development remains elusive. In this study, we identified Drosophila CYLD (dCYLD) as a negative regulator of the Hippo pathway in vivo. dCYLD associates and colocalizes with Hpo, a core component of the Hippo pathway, in the cytoplasm, and decreases Hpo activity through limiting its phosphorylation at T195. We also showed that dCYLD limits Hippo signal transduction as evidenced by decreasing phosphorylation and thereby increasing activity of Yki, the key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway.

The excipients, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and methylcellulose (MC), are often used in drug delivery systems and so it is important to understand the impact of associated factors on their charging and adhesion mechanisms, however, little work has been reported in this area. Such phenomena become more prominent when excipients are introduced to a powder mixture alongside the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) (APIs) with inter- and intra-particulate interactions giving rise to electrification and surface adhesion of powder particles. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of material attributes (particle size, hydroxypropyl (Hpo) to methoxyl (Meo) ratio and molecular size) on the charging and adhesion characteristics of cellulose ethers. Furthermore, a poorly compactible and highly electrostatically charged drug, flurbiprofen, was used to develop binary powder mixtures having different polymer to drug ratios and the relationship between tribo-electric charging and surface adhesion was studied. Charge was induced on powder particles and measured using a custom built device based on a shaking concept, consisting of a Faraday cup connected to an electrometer. The diversity in physicochemical properties has shown a significant impact on the tribo-electric charging and adhesion behaviour of MC and HPMC. Moreover, the adhesion and electrostatic charge of the API was significantly reduced when MC and HPMC were incorporated and tribo-electric charging showed a linear relationship (R(2)=0.81-0.98) with particle surface adhesion, however, other factors were also involved. It is anticipated that such a reduction in charge and particle surface adhesion would improve flow and compaction properties during processing.","PMID":25193137,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ghori","initials":"MU","foreName":"Muhammad U"},{"lastName":"Supuk","initials":"E","foreName":"Enes"},{"lastName":"Conway","initials":"BR","foreName":"Barbara R"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16317,"articleTitle":"Effective diagnosis of genetic disease by computational phenotype analysis of the disease-associated genome.","dateCreated":"2014-09-04","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1946-6242","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Science translational medicine","isoAbbreviation":"Sci Transl Med"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Less than half of patients with suspected genetic disease receive a molecular diagnosis.

Major functional groups and chemical structure of the isolates were identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and solid-state carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C NMR) analysis.

In membrane filtration tests, unified membrane fouling index (UMFI) and hydraulic resistance were used to quantify irreversible fouling potential of different water samples. Results show that under similar DOC level in feed water, colloids present much more irreversible fouling than other fractions.

The core components of this pathway are two kinases, Hippo (Hpo) and Warts (Wts), and a transcriptional coactivator, Yorkie (Yki). Yes-associated protein (YAP, a Yki homolog in mammals) promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell migration in vitro. Here, we use border cells in the Drosophila ovary as a model to study Hippo pathway functions in cell migration in vivo. During oogenesis, polar cells secrete Unpaired (Upd), which activates JAK/STAT signaling of neighboring cells and specifies them into outer border cells. The outer border cells form a cluster with polar cells and undergo migration. We find that hpo and wts are required for migration of the border cell cluster. In outer border cells, overexpression of hpo disrupts polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and attenuates migration. In polar cells, knockdown of hpo and wts or overexpression of yki impairs border cell induction and disrupts migration. These manipulations in polar cells reduce JAK/STAT activity in outer border cells. Expression of upd-lacZ is increased and decreased in yki and hpo mutant polar cells, respectively. Furthermore, forced expression of upd in polar cells rescues defects of border cell induction and migration caused by wts knockdown. These results suggest that Yki negatively regulates border cell induction by inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling. Together, our data elucidate two distinct mechanisms of the Hippo pathway in controlling border cell migration: (1) in outer border cells, it regulates polarized distribution of the actin cytoskeleton; (2) in polar cells, it regulates upd expression to control border cell induction and migration.","PMID":25161211,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"TH","foreName":"Tzu-Huai"},{"lastName":"Yeh","initials":"TH","foreName":"Tsung-Han"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"TW","foreName":"Tsu-Wei"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"JY","foreName":"Jenn-Yah"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16309,"articleTitle":"The sterile 20-like kinase tao controls tissue homeostasis by regulating the hippo pathway in Drosophila adult midgut.","dateCreated":"2014-08-27","dateRevised":"2014-08-27","publication":{"issnNumber":"1673-8527","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao","isoAbbreviation":"J Genet Genomics"},"articleDate":"2014-06-19","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells must be tightly controlled in order to maintain resident tissue homeostasis.

In conclusion, HPO can decrease AQP4 expression in brain tissue of rabbits with cerebral hemorrhage to suppress the progression of brain edema and promote repairing of injured tissue. 2.0 ATA HPO exerts best effects, which provides an experimental basis for ATA selection of HPO in treating cerebral hemorrhage.","PMID":25064222,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"J","foreName":"Jing"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"J","foreName":"Jiong"},{"lastName":"Guo","initials":"H","foreName":"Hua"},{"lastName":"Peng","initials":"F","foreName":"Fang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16275,"articleTitle":"GrabBlur--a framework to facilitate the secure exchange of whole-exome and -genome SNV data using VCF files.","dateCreated":"2014-07-24","dateRevised":"2015-08-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"1471-2164","issnType":"Electronic","title":"BMC genomics","isoAbbreviation":"BMC Genomics"},"articleDate":"2014-05-20","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of whole exomes or genomes is increasingly being used in human genetic research and diagnostics. Sharing NGS data with third parties can help physicians and researchers to identify causative or predisposing mutations for a specific sample of interest more efficiently. In many cases, however, the exchange of such data may collide with data privacy regulations. GrabBlur is a newly developed tool to aggregate and share NGS-derived single nucleotide variant (SNV) data in a public database, keeping individual samples unidentifiable. In contrast to other currently existing SNV databases, GrabBlur includes phenotypic information and contact details of the submitter of a given database entry. By means of GrabBlur human geneticists can securely and easily share SNV data from resequencing projects. GrabBlur can ease the interpretation of SNV data by offering basic annotations, genotype frequencies and in particular phenotypic information - given that this information was shared - for the SNV of interest.GrabBlur facilitates the combination of phenotypic and NGS data (VCF files) via a local interface or command line operations. Data submissions may include HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms, other trait descriptions, NGS technology information and the identity of the submitter. Most of this information is optional and its provision at the discretion of the submitter. Upon initial intake, GrabBlur merges and aggregates all sample-specific data. If a certain SNV is rare, the sample-specific information is replaced with the submitter identity. Generally, all data in GrabBlur are highly aggregated so that they can be shared with others while ensuring maximum privacy. Thus, it is impossible to reconstruct complete exomes or genomes from the database or to re-identify single individuals. After the individual information has been sufficiently \"blurred\", the data can be uploaded into a publicly accessible domain where aggregated genotypes are provided alongside phenotypic information. A web interface allows querying the database and the extraction of gene-wise SNV information. If an interesting SNV is found, the interrogator can get in contact with the submitter to exchange further information on the carrier and clarify, for example, whether the latter's phenotype matches with phenotype of their own patient.","PMID":25055742,"authors":[{"lastName":"Stade","initials":"B","foreName":"Björn"},{"lastName":"Seelow","initials":"D","foreName":"Dominik"},{"lastName":"Thomsen","initials":"I","foreName":"Ingo"},{"lastName":"Krawczak","initials":"M","foreName":"Michael"},{"lastName":"Franke","initials":"A","foreName":"Andre"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16274,"articleTitle":"Ten years of industrial and municipal membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems - lessons from the field.","dateCreated":"2014-07-23","dateRevised":"2014-07-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"0273-1223","issnType":"Print","title":"Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research","isoAbbreviation":"Water Sci.

However, variant interpretation relative to patient phenotype can be challenging in some scenarios, particularly clinical assessment of rare complex phenotypes. Each patient's sequence reveals many possibly damaging variants that must be individually assessed to establish clear association with patient phenotype. To assist interpretation, we implemented an algorithm that ranks a given set of genes relative to patient phenotype. The algorithm orders genes by the semantic similarity computed between phenotypic descriptors associated with each gene and those describing the patient. Phenotypic descriptor terms are taken from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and semantic similarity is derived from each term's information content.Model validation was performed via simulation and with clinical data. We simulated 33 Mendelian diseases with 100 patients per disease. We modeled clinical conditions by adding noise and imprecision, i.e. phenotypic terms unrelated to the disease and terms less specific than the actual disease terms. We ranked the causative gene against all 2488 HPO annotated genes. The median causative gene rank was 1 for the optimal and noise cases, 12 for the imprecision case, and 60 for the imprecision with noise case. Additionally, we examined a clinical cohort of subjects with hearing impairment. The disease gene median rank was 22. However, when also considering the patient's exome data and filtering non-exomic and common variants, the median rank improved to 3.Semantic similarity can rank a causative gene highly within a gene list relative to patient phenotype characteristics, provided that imprecision is mitigated. The clinical case results suggest that phenotype rank combined with variant analysis provides significant improvement over the individual approaches. We expect that this combined prioritization approach may increase accuracy and decrease effort for clinical genetic diagnosis.","PMID":25047600,"authors":[{"lastName":"Masino","initials":"AJ","foreName":"Aaron J"},{"lastName":"Dechene","initials":"ET","foreName":"Elizabeth T"},{"lastName":"Dulik","initials":"MC","foreName":"Matthew C"},{"lastName":"Wilkens","initials":"A","foreName":"Alisha"},{"lastName":"Spinner","initials":"NB","foreName":"Nancy B"},{"lastName":"Krantz","initials":"ID","foreName":"Ian D"},{"lastName":"Pennington","initials":"JW","foreName":"Jeffrey W"},{"lastName":"Robinson","initials":"PN","foreName":"Peter N"},{"lastName":"White","initials":"PS","foreName":"Peter S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16324,"articleTitle":"Impact of food restriction on ovarian development, RFamide-related peptide-3 and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in pre-pubertal ewes.","dateCreated":"2014-09-11","dateRevised":"2014-09-11","publication":{"issnNumber":"1439-0531","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene","isoAbbreviation":"Reprod.

Here, we examine the roles of cell growth and a highly conserved organ growth regulatory pathway in controlling the dimensions of the Drosophila tracheal (airway) system, a well-characterized system for investigating epithelial tube morphogenesis. We find that tracheal tube-size is regulated in unexpected ways by the transcription factor Yorkie (Yki, homolog of mammalian YAP and TAZ) and the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) kinase pathway. Yki activity typically promotes cell division, inhibits apoptosis, and can promote cell growth. However, reducing Yki activity in developing embryos increases rather than decreases the length of the major tracheal tubes, the dorsal trunks (DTs). Similarly, reduction of Hippo pathway activity, which antagonizes Yki, shortens tracheal DTs. yki mutations do not alter DT cell volume or cell number, indicating that Yki and the Hippo pathway regulate cell shape and apical surface area, but not volume. Yki does not appear to act through known tracheal pathways of apical extracellular matrix, septate junctions (SJs), basolateral or tubular polarity. Instead, the Hippo pathway and Yki appear to act downstream or in parallel to SJs because a double mutant combination of an upstream Hippo pathway activator, kibra, and the SJ component sinu have the short tracheal phenotype of a kibra mutant. We demonstrate that the critical target of Yki in tube size control is Drosophila Inhibitor of Apoptosis 1 (DIAP1), which in turn antagonizes the Drosophila effector caspase, Ice. Strikingly, there is no change in tracheal cell number in DIAP1 or Ice mutants, thus epithelial tube size regulation defines new non-apoptotic roles for Yki, DIAP1 and Ice.","PMID":25036253,"authors":[{"lastName":"Robbins","initials":"RM","foreName":"Renée M"},{"lastName":"Gbur","initials":"SC","foreName":"Samantha C"},{"lastName":"Beitel","initials":"GJ","foreName":"Greg J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16301,"articleTitle":"Kinetics and mechanism of sonochemical degradation of pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater.","dateCreated":"2014-08-19","dateRevised":"2014-08-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5851","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Environmental science & technology","isoAbbreviation":"Environ.

To understand the mechanism of the heterodimerization of SARAH domains, the three-dimensional structures of an MST1-RASSF5 SARAH heterodimer and an MST2 SARAH homodimer were determined by X-ray crystallography and were analysed together with that previously determined for the MST1 SARAH homodimer. While the structure of the MST2 homodimer resembled that of the MST1 homodimer, the MST1-RASSF5 heterodimer showed distinct structural features. Firstly, the six N-terminal residues (Asp432-Lys437), which correspond to the short N-terminal 3\u2081\u2080-helix h1 kinked from the h2 helix in the MST1 homodimer, were disordered. Furthermore, the MST1 SARAH domain in the MST1-RASSF5 complex showed a longer helical structure (Ser438-Lys480) than that in the MST1 homodimer (Val441-Lys480). Moreover, extensive polar and nonpolar contacts in the MST1-RASSF5 SARAH domain were identified which strengthen the interactions in the heterodimer in comparison to the interactions in the homodimer. Denaturation experiments performed using urea also indicated that the MST-RASSF heterodimers are substantially more stable than the MST homodimers. These findings provide structural insights into the role of the MST1-RASSF5 SARAH domain in apoptosis signalling.","PMID":25004971,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hwang","initials":"E","foreName":"Eunha"},{"lastName":"Cheong","initials":"HK","foreName":"Hae-Kap"},{"lastName":"Ul Mushtaq","initials":"A","foreName":"Ameeq"},{"lastName":"Kim","initials":"HY","foreName":"Hye-Yeon"},{"lastName":"Yeo","initials":"KJ","foreName":"Kwon Joo"},{"lastName":"Kim","initials":"E","foreName":"Eunhee"},{"lastName":"Lee","initials":"WC","foreName":"Woo Cheol"},{"lastName":"Hwang","initials":"KY","foreName":"Kwang Yeon"},{"lastName":"Cheong","initials":"C","foreName":"Chaejoon"},{"lastName":"Jeon","initials":"YH","foreName":"Young Ho"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16256,"articleTitle":"Cytoskeletal tension inhibits Hippo signaling through an Ajuba-Warts complex.","dateCreated":"2014-07-05","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1097-4172","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Cell","isoAbbreviation":"Cell"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Mechanical forces have been proposed to modulate organ growth, but a molecular mechanism that links them to growth regulation in vivo has been lacking.

The influence of myosin activity on Yorkie depends genetically on the Ajuba LIM protein Jub, a negative regulator of Warts within the Hippo pathway.

Moreover, both Hh signaling and Yki positively regulate the rate of FSC proliferation, both are essential for FSC maintenance, and both promote increased FSC longevity and FSC duplication when in excess. We also found that responses to activated Yki depend on Cyclin E induction while responses to excess Hh signaling depend on Yki induction, and excess Yki can compensate for defective Hh signaling.

In our study, the yeast Pichia pastoris initially was applied as whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of (+)-nootkatone from (+)-valencene, the abundant aroma compound of oranges.

Intracellular production of (+)-valencene by co-expression of valencene synthase from Callitropsis nootkatensis resolved the phase-transfer issues of (+)-valencene. Bi-phasic cultivations of P. pastoris resulted in the production of trans-nootkatol, which was oxidized to (+)-nootkatone by an intrinsic P. pastoris activity. Additional overexpression of a P. pastoris alcohol dehydrogenase and truncated hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (tHmg1p) significantly enhanced the (+)-nootkatone yield to 208mg L(-1) cell culture in bioreactor cultivations.

The core pathway consists of a protein kinase Hpo (MST1/2 in mammals) that is regulated by a number of upstream inputs including Drosophila Ras Association Factor, dRASSF. We have previously shown in the developing Drosophila eye epithelium that loss of the apico-basal cell polarity regulator lethal-(2)-giant-larvae (lgl), and the concomitant increase in aPKC activity, results in ectopic proliferation and suppression of developmental cell death by blocking Hpo pathway signalling. Here, we further explore how Lgl/aPKC interacts with the Hpo pathway. Deregulation of the Hpo pathway by Lgl depletion is associated with the mislocalization of Hpo and dRASSF. We demonstrate that Lgl/aPKC regulate the Hpo pathway independently of upstream inputs from Fat/Dachs and the Kibra/Expanded/Merlin complex. We show depletion of Lgl also results in accumulation and mislocalization of components of the dSTRIPAK complex, a major phosphatase complex that directly binds to dRASSF and represses Hpo activity. However, depleting dSTRIPAK components, or removal of dRASSF did not rescue the lgl-/- or aPKC overexpression phenotypes. Thus, Lgl/aPKC regulate Hpo activity by a novel mechanism, independently of dRASSF and dSTRIPAK. Surprisingly, removal of dRASSF in tissue with increased aPKC activity results in mild tissue overgrowth, indicating that in this context dRASSF acts as a tumor suppressor. This effect was independent of the Hpo and Ras Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways, suggesting that dRASSF regulates a novel pathway to control tissue growth.","PMID":24743776,"authors":[{"lastName":"Parsons","initials":"LM","foreName":"Linda M"},{"lastName":"Grzeschik","initials":"NA","foreName":"Nicola A"},{"lastName":"Richardson","initials":"HE","foreName":"Helena E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16189,"articleTitle":"An AIE active monoimidazolium skeleton: high selectivity and fluorescence turn-on for H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b in acetonitrile and ClO\u2084\u207b in water.","dateCreated":"2014-04-29","dateRevised":"2014-04-29","publication":{"issnNumber":"1364-548X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)","isoAbbreviation":"Chem.

Since excretion of H\u2082PO\u2084(-) frequently exceeds its glomerular filtration, this approach is considered inadequate by Pitts. He claimed that it is the tubular H(+) secretion which converts filtered HPO\u2084(2-) to H\u2082PO\u2084(-), thereafter excreted in urine. This is only true under conditions of inorganic acid or neutral phosphate loading, when the maximum tubular phosphate reabsorption (TmPi) is overcharged. In controls, H\u2082PO\u2084(-) excretion is lower than its glomerular filtration, provided that acid-base status is normal and tubular phosphate reabsorption is below the TmPi. The TmPi is lower than its glomerular filtration, provided that acid-base status is normal and tubular phosphate reabsorption is below the TmPi. When the TmPi is exceeded, a portion of HPO\u2084(2-) escapes proximal reabsorption, reaching the distal tubule where its absorption is precluded, while tubular H(+) secretion converts HPO\u2084(2-) to H\u2082PO\u2084(-).

Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway (HMG-CoA reductase) by statins opposes YAP/TAZ nuclear localization and transcriptional responses. Mechanistically, the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate produced by the mevalonate cascade is required for activation of Rho GTPases that, in turn, activate YAP/TAZ by inhibiting their phosphorylation and promoting their nuclear accumulation. The mevalonate-YAP/TAZ axis is required for proliferation and self-renewal of breast cancer cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, inhibition of mevalonate biosynthesis and geranylgeranylation blunts the eye overgrowth induced by Yorkie, the YAP/TAZ orthologue. In tumour cells, YAP/TAZ activation is promoted by increased levels of mevalonic acid produced by SREBP transcriptional activity, which is induced by its oncogenic cofactor mutant p53.

Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size in both Drosophila and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the control of tissue growth in Drosophila. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size control throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.","PMID":24509725,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ikmi","initials":"A","foreName":"Aissam"},{"lastName":"Gaertner","initials":"B","foreName":"Bjoern"},{"lastName":"Seidel","initials":"C","foreName":"Christopher"},{"lastName":"Srivastava","initials":"M","foreName":"Mansi"},{"lastName":"Zeitlinger","initials":"J","foreName":"Julia"},{"lastName":"Gibson","initials":"MC","foreName":"Matthew C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16097,"articleTitle":"Analysis of aquatic-phase natural organic matter by optimized LDI-MS method.","dateCreated":"2014-01-27","dateRevised":"2014-01-27","publication":{"issnNumber":"1096-9888","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS","isoAbbreviation":"J Mass Spectrom"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The composition and physiochemical properties of aquatic-phase natural organic matter (NOM) are most important problems for both environmental studies and water industry.

In this study, hydrophobic NOMs (HPO NOMs) from river, reservoir and waste water were characterized by this technique. The effect of analytical variables like concentration, solvent composition and laser energy was investigated. The exact masses of small molecular NOM moieties in the range of 200-1200\u2009m/z were determined in reflectron mode. In addition, spectra of post-source-decay experiments in this range showed that some compounds from different natural NOMs had the same fragmental ions. In the large mass range of 1200-15,000\u2009Da, macromolecules and their aggregates were found in HPO NOMs from natural waters. Highly humic HPO exhibited mass peaks larger than 8000\u2009Da.

Several tumour-suppressor genes are indeed involved in establishing and maintaining a correct apical-basal polarity suggesting that a link exists between disruption of epithelial polarity and the control of cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of this link is only beginning to be unveiled. In Drosophila, the tumour suppressor gene lethal giant larvae (lgl) is widely used as a genetic tool in cancer modelling: its loss of function causes neoplastic growth of the imaginal tissues, larval epithelial organs from which adult structures originate. These mutant epithelia are characterised by loss of cell polarity and tissue architecture as well as hyperproliferation. We observed that in a clonal context, the ability of lgl mutant cells to express their neoplastic potential correlates with the levels of the oncoprotein Myc, a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Malignant, polarity-deficient mutant cells upregulate Myc and are able to overcome the tumour-suppressive defences imposed by the surrounding wild-type tissue. How does the loss of lgl function induce an increase in Myc levels? The answer to this question came from the finding that Lgl is an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, a highly conserved signalling network that controls proliferation of epithelial cells and organ size. The core of this pathway responds to several upstream regulators and converges on the inhibition of a transcriptional co-factor, Yorkie, which, as we and others have shown, is a direct regulator of the myc promoter. In this review we discuss the key findings that contributed to the identification of this regulatory network that links cell polarity to cell proliferation control.","PMID":24395559,"authors":[{"lastName":"Grifoni","initials":"D","foreName":"Daniela"},{"lastName":"Froldi","initials":"F","foreName":"Francesca"},{"lastName":"Pession","initials":"A","foreName":"Annalisa"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16076,"articleTitle":"The effects of hypoventilation disorder on physiological and biochemical properties of the hindlimb muscles.","dateCreated":"2014-01-06","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1880-313X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Biomedical research (Tokyo, Japan)","isoAbbreviation":"Biomed.

In the present study, we characterized the structure, distribution, and meal responsive of NUCB2A/nesfatin-1 in Ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti) for the first time. The full length cDNA of Ya-fish was 2140base pair (bp), which encoded a polypeptide of 487 amino acid residues including a 23 amino acid signal peptide. A high conservation in NUCB2 sequences was found in vertebrates, however the proposed propeptide cleavage site (Arg-Arg) conserved among other species is not present in Ya-fish NUCB2A sequence.

NUCB2A mRNA expression respond to feeding status change may vary and be tissue specific. NUCB2A mRNA levels significantly increased (P<0.05) in the hypothalamus and intestines after feeding and substantially decreased (P<0.01) during a week food deprivation in the hypothalamus. Meanwhile, NUCB2A mRNA in the hepatopancreas was significantly elevated (P<0.001) during food deprivation, and a similar increase was also found after short-time fasting. This points toward a potential hepatopancreas specific local role for NUCB2A in the regulation of metabolism during food deprivation.

Vaginal cytology was evaluated daily, and blood samples were taken from mice in proestrus.

To determine if the smaller LH surges and the reduced number of litters in betaERKO were due to the lack of ESR2 in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or due to the absence of ESR2 in the ovary, ovaries were transplanted from WT into betaERKO mice and vice versa. The size of the LH surge was reduced only in mice lacking ESR2 within the ovary, and these mice had fewer litters. Fertility and size of the LH surge were rescued in betaERKO mice receiving a WT ovary. These data provide the first experimental evidence that the LH surge is impaired in betaERKO females and may contribute to their reduced fertility.

Moreover, they appear to be regulatory/targeting subunits for the major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. In addition, striatin family members associate with germinal center kinase III kinases as well as other novel components, earning these assemblies the name striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. Recently, there has been a great increase in functional and mechanistic studies aimed at identifying and understanding the roles of STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes in cellular processes of multiple organisms. These studies have identified novel STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes and have explored their roles in specific signaling pathways. Together, the results of these studies have sparked increased interest in striatin family complexes because they have revealed roles in signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, Golgi assembly, cell polarity, cell migration, neural and vascular development, and cardiac function. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been connected to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, autism, and cerebral cavernous malformation.

The Fat/Hippo pathway responds to morphogen gradients and influences the in-plane polarization of cells and orientation of divisions, linking growth with tissue patterning. Remarkably, the Fat pathway transduces a growth signal through the polarization of transmembrane complexes that responds to both morphogen level and gradient. Dissection of these complex phenotypes requires a quantitative model that provides a systematic characterization of the pathway. In the absence of detailed knowledge of molecular interactions, we take a phenomenological approach that considers a broad class of simple models, which are sufficiently constrained by observations to enable insight into possible mechanisms. We predict two modes of local/cooperative interactions among Fat-Dachsous complexes, which are necessary for the collective polarization of tissues and enhanced sensitivity to weak gradients. Collective polarization convolves level and gradient of input signals, reproducing known phenotypes while generating falsifiable predictions. Our construction of a simplified signal transduction map allows a generalization of the positional value model and emphasizes the important role intercellular interactions play in growth and patterning of tissues.","PMID":24282293,"authors":[{"lastName":"Mani","initials":"M","foreName":"Madhav"},{"lastName":"Goyal","initials":"S","foreName":"Sidhartha"},{"lastName":"Irvine","initials":"KD","foreName":"Kenneth D"},{"lastName":"Shraiman","initials":"BI","foreName":"Boris I"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16064,"articleTitle":"Crossing the divide between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis in water oxidation.","dateCreated":"2013-12-25","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1091-6490","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","isoAbbreviation":"Proc.

Furthermore, overexpression of bantam microRNA results in increase of the division of the midgut precursor cells, whereas loss of bantam microRNA decreases their proliferation. The mechanical studies show that bantam microRNA is essential for the Hpo pathway induced cell-autonomous ISC self-renewal, while it is disposable for EGFR and Notch pathways mediated ISC proliferation.

This research contributes to HPO from an operations management (OM) perspective by addressing the alignment, integration and coordination of activities within patient care processes. The objective of this study was to develop and practically test a new measurement tool for assessing the degree of PO within hospitals using existing tools.Through a literature search we identified a number of constructs to measure PO in hospital settings. These constructs were further operationalized, using an OM perspective. Based on five dimensions of an existing questionnaire a new HPO-measurement tool was developed to measure the degree of PO within hospitals on the basis of respondents' perception. The HPO-measurement tool was pre-tested in a non-participating hospital and discussed with experts in a focus group. The multicentre exploratory case study was conducted in the ophthalmic practices of three different types of Dutch hospitals. In total 26 employees from three disciplines participated. After filling in the questionnaire an interview was held with each participant to check the validity and the reliability of the measurement tool.The application of the HPO-measurement tool, analysis of the scores and interviews with the participants resulted in the possibility to identify differences of PO performance and the areas of improvement--from a PO point of view--within each hospital. The result of refinement of the items of the measurement tool after practical testing is a set of 41 items to assess the degree of PO from an OM perspective within hospitals.The development and practically testing of a new HPO-measurement tool improves the understanding and application of PO in hospitals and the reliability of the measurement tool.

Organic matter fractionation according to hydrophobicity and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) index were used to specifically characterize the produced algal organic matter (AOM). The AOM characteristics were both growth phase and species dependent. However, a similar evolution was observed. The hydrophilic fraction (HPI) was the major fraction whatever the growth phases and was almost the only one produced during lag and exponential phases. It represented around 75% of AOM during exponential phase and then decreased when the stationary phase appeared. It represented 46% and 60% of the AOM during late decline phase for the cyanobacteria and the alga respectively. The hydrophobic (HPO) and transphilic (TPH) fractions started to appear from the beginning of the stationary phase with more hydrophobic compounds coming from intracellular organic material of dying cells.

The adult Drosophila abdominal epithelium provides an attractive new system to address how postmitotic diploid cells contribute to repair.Puncture wounds to the adult Drosophila epidermis close initially by forming a melanized scab. We found that epithelial cells near the wound site fuse to form a giant syncytium, which sends lamellae under the scab to re-epithelialize the damaged site. Other large cells arise more peripherally by initiating endocycles and becoming polyploid, or by cell fusion. Rac GTPase activity is needed for syncytium formation, while the Hippo signaling effector Yorkie modulates both polyploidization and cell fusion. Large cell formation is functionally important because when both polyploidization and fusion are blocked, wounds do not re-epithelialize.Our observations indicate that cell mass lost upon wounding can be replaced by polyploidization instead of mitotic proliferation. We propose that large cells generated by polyploidization or cell fusion are essential because they are better able than diploid cells to mechanically stabilize wounds, especially those containing permanent acellular structures, such as scar tissue.","PMID":24184101,"authors":[{"lastName":"Losick","initials":"VP","foreName":"Vicki P"},{"lastName":"Fox","initials":"DT","foreName":"Donald T"},{"lastName":"Spradling","initials":"AC","foreName":"Allan C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16079,"articleTitle":"Influence of hydrophobic/hydrophilic fractions of extracellular organic matters of Microcystis aeruginosa on ultrafiltration membrane fouling.","dateCreated":"2014-01-09","dateRevised":"2014-01-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-1026","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Science of the total environment","isoAbbreviation":"Sci.

The experimental data indicated that EOM exhibited similar flux decline trends on polyethersulfone (PES) and regenerated cellulose (RC) membranes but caused greater irreversible fouling on PES membrane than RC membrane due to its hydrophobic property.

Moreover, JNK promoted binding of LIMD1 and LATS1 through direct phosphorylation of LIMD1.

Thus, we describe a previously unknown branch of the SWH pathway that controls tissue growth downstream of Ds.","PMID":23955303,"authors":[{"lastName":"Degoutin","initials":"JL","foreName":"Joffrey L"},{"lastName":"Milton","initials":"CC","foreName":"Claire C"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"E","foreName":"Eefang"},{"lastName":"Tipping","initials":"M","foreName":"Marla"},{"lastName":"Bosveld","initials":"F","foreName":"Floris"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"L","foreName":"Liu"},{"lastName":"Bellaiche","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yohanns"},{"lastName":"Veraksa","initials":"A","foreName":"Alexey"},{"lastName":"Harvey","initials":"KF","foreName":"Kieran F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16021,"articleTitle":"Influence of ions on the coagulation and removal of fullerene in aqueous phase.","dateCreated":"2013-11-12","dateRevised":"2013-11-12","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-1026","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Science of the total environment","isoAbbreviation":"Sci.

Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila homolog of the oncoprotein Myc (dMyc) functions downstream of these signaling pathways to mediate their effects on ISC proliferation. dMyc expression in precursor cells is stimulated in response to tissue damage, and dMyc is essential for accelerated ISC proliferation and midgut regeneration. We show that tissue damage caused by dextran sulfate sodium feeding stimulates dMyc expression via the Hpo pathway, whereas bleomycin feeding activates dMyc through the JAK-STAT and EGFR pathways. We provide evidence that dMyc expression is transcriptionally upregulated by multiple signaling pathways, which is required for optimal ISC proliferation in response to tissue damage. We have also obtained evidence that tissue damage can upregulate dMyc expression post-transcriptionally. Finally, we show that a basal level of dMyc expression is required for ISC maintenance, proliferation and lineage differentiation during normal tissue homeostasis.","PMID":23896988,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ren","initials":"F","foreName":"Fangfang"},{"lastName":"Shi","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qing"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yongbin"},{"lastName":"Jiang","initials":"A","foreName":"Alice"},{"lastName":"Ip","initials":"YT","foreName":"Y Tony"},{"lastName":"Jiang","initials":"H","foreName":"Huaqi"},{"lastName":"Jiang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jin"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15915,"articleTitle":"Sensory neuron fates are distinguished by a transcriptional switch that regulates dendrite branch stabilization.","dateCreated":"2013-07-29","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1097-4199","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Neuron","isoAbbreviation":"Neuron"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Sensory neurons adopt distinct morphologies and functional modalities to mediate responses to specific stimuli.

Using an epithelial cancer model in Drosophila melanogaster, we carried out an overexpression screen for oncogenes capable of cooperating with the loss of the epithelial apico-basal cell polarity regulator, scribbled (scrib), and identified the cell fate regulator, Abrupt, a BTB-zinc finger protein. Abrupt overexpression alone is insufficient to transform cells, but in cooperation with scrib loss of function, Abrupt promotes the formation of massive tumours in the eye/antennal disc. The steroid hormone receptor coactivator, Taiman (a homologue of SRC3/AIB1), is known to associate with Abrupt, and Taiman overexpression also drives tumour formation in cooperation with the loss of Scrib. Expression arrays and ChIP-Seq indicates that Abrupt overexpression represses a large number of genes, including steroid hormone-response genes and multiple cell fate regulators, thereby maintaining cells within an epithelial progenitor-like state. The progenitor-like state is characterised by the failure to express the conserved Eyes absent/Dachshund regulatory complex in the eye disc, and in the antennal disc by the failure to express cell fate regulators that define the temporal elaboration of the appendage along the proximo-distal axis downstream of Distalless. Loss of scrib promotes cooperation with Abrupt through impaired Hippo signalling, which is required and sufficient for cooperative overgrowth with Abrupt, and JNK (Jun kinase) signalling, which is required for tumour cell migration/invasion but not overgrowth. These results thus identify a novel cooperating oncogene, identify mammalian family members of which are also known oncogenes, and demonstrate that epithelial tumours in Drosophila can be characterised by the maintenance of a progenitor-like state.","PMID":23874226,"authors":[{"lastName":"Turkel","initials":"N","foreName":"Nezaket"},{"lastName":"Sahota","initials":"VK","foreName":"Virender K"},{"lastName":"Bolden","initials":"JE","foreName":"Jessica E"},{"lastName":"Goulding","initials":"KR","foreName":"Karen R"},{"lastName":"Doggett","initials":"K","foreName":"Karen"},{"lastName":"Willoughby","initials":"LF","foreName":"Lee F"},{"lastName":"Blanco","initials":"E","foreName":"Enrique"},{"lastName":"Martin-Blanco","initials":"E","foreName":"Enrique"},{"lastName":"Corominas","initials":"M","foreName":"Montserrat"},{"lastName":"Ellul","initials":"J","foreName":"Jason"},{"lastName":"Aigaki","initials":"T","foreName":"Toshiro"},{"lastName":"Richardson","initials":"HE","foreName":"Helena E"},{"lastName":"Brumby","initials":"AM","foreName":"Anthony M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15944,"articleTitle":"The neuronal transcription factor erect wing regulates specification and maintenance of Drosophila R8 photoreceptor subtypes.","dateCreated":"2013-08-27","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1095-564X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Developmental biology","isoAbbreviation":"Dev.

Further, ewg is continuously required to maintain repression of Rh6 in pR8s in aging flies.

The pathway was named after Hippo, which was regarded as a key component. The pathway was initially considered to be well conserved in mammals. Indeed the mammalian homologues of Hippo, and Warts negatively regulate Yorkie homologue and function as the tumour suppressors.

The YAP transcription coactivator is a major effector of the Hippo pathway and is phosphorylated and inactivated by the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2. It has recently been shown that YAP activity is regulated by G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Here we demonstrate that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger downstream from Gαs-coupled receptors, acts through protein kinase A (PKA) and Rho GTPases to stimulate Lats kinases and YAP phosphorylation. We also show that inactivation of YAP is crucial for PKA-induced adipogenesis. In addition, PKA activation in Drosophila inhibits the expression of Yorki (Yki, a YAP ortholog) target genes involved in cell proliferation and death. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Hippo-YAP is a key signaling branch of cAMP and PKA and reveals new insight into mechanisms of PKA in regulating a broad range of cellular functions.","PMID":23752589,"authors":[{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"FX","foreName":"Fa-Xing"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yifan"},{"lastName":"Park","initials":"HW","foreName":"Hyun Woo"},{"lastName":"Jewell","initials":"JL","foreName":"Jenna L"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qian"},{"lastName":"Deng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yaoting"},{"lastName":"Pan","initials":"D","foreName":"Duojia"},{"lastName":"Taylor","initials":"SS","foreName":"Susan S"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"ZC","foreName":"Zhi-Chun"},{"lastName":"Guan","initials":"KL","foreName":"Kun-Liang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15875,"articleTitle":"Adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis mechanism in kinesin studied by combined quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical metadynamics simulations.","dateCreated":"2013-06-19","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5126","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","isoAbbreviation":"J.

While motility and atomic structures have been well-characterized for various members of the kinesin family, not much is known about ATP hydrolysis inside the active site. Here, we study ATP hydrolysis mechanisms in the kinesin-5 protein Eg5 by using combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics simulations. Approximately 200 atoms at the catalytic site are treated by a dispersion-corrected density functional and, in total, 13 metadynamics simulations are performed with their cumulative time reaching ~0.7 ns. Using the converged runs, we compute free energy surfaces and obtain a few hydrolysis pathways. The pathway with the lowest free energy barrier involves a two-water chain and is initiated by the Pγ-Oβ dissociation concerted with approach of the lytic water to PγO3-. This immediately induces a proton transfer from the lytic water to another water, which then gives a proton to the conserved Glu270. Later, the proton is transferred back from Glu270 to HPO(4)2- via another hydrogen-bonded chain. We find that the reaction is favorable when the salt bridge between Glu270 in switch II and Arg234 in switch I is transiently broken, which facilitates the ability of Glu270 to accept a proton. When ATP is placed in the ADP-bound conformation of Eg5, the ATP-Mg moiety is surrounded by many water molecules and Thr107 blocks the water chain, which together make the hydrolysis reaction less favorable. The observed two-water chain mechanisms are rather similar to those suggested in two other motors, myosin and F1-ATPase, raising the possibility of a common mechanism.","PMID":23751065,"authors":[{"lastName":"McGrath","initials":"MJ","foreName":"Matthew J"},{"lastName":"Kuo","initials":"IF","foreName":"I-F Will"},{"lastName":"Hayashi","initials":"S","foreName":"Shigehiko"},{"lastName":"Takada","initials":"S","foreName":"Shoji"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15867,"articleTitle":"The Hippo pathway polarizes the actin cytoskeleton during collective migration of Drosophila border cells.","dateCreated":"2013-06-11","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1540-8140","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Journal of cell biology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

How developmental lineage hierarchies of these cells prefigure their neoplastic propensities is not yet well-understood.

In a context of alleviated tissue surveillance, for example, loss of Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) tumor suppressor in the wing primordium induced epithelial neoplasia in its Homothorax (Hth)-expressing proximal domain. Transcriptional profile of proximally transformed mosaic wing epithelium and functional tests revealed tumor cooperation by multiple signaling pathways. In contrast, lgl(-) clones in the Vestigial (Vg)-expressing distal wing epithelium were eliminated by cell death. Distal lgl(-) clones, however, could transform when both tissue surveillance and cell death were compromised genetically and, alternatively, when the transcription cofactor of Hippo signaling pathway, Yorkie (Yki), was activated, or when Ras/EGFR signaling was up-regulated. Furthermore, transforming distal lgl(-) clones displayed loss of Vg, suggesting reversal of their terminal cell fate commitment. In contrast, reinforcing a distal (wing) cell fate commitment in lgl(-) clones by gaining Vg arrested their neoplasia and induced cell death. We also show that neoplasia in both distal and proximal lgl(-) clones could progress in the absence of Hth, revealing Hth-independent wing epithelial neoplasia. Likewise, neoplasia in the eye primordium resulted in loss of Elav, a retinal cell marker; these, however, switched to an Hth-dependent primitive cell state. These results suggest a general characteristic of \"cells-of-origin\" in epithelial cancers, namely their propensity for switch to primitive cell states.","PMID":23708122,"authors":[{"lastName":"Khan","initials":"SJ","foreName":"Sumbul J"},{"lastName":"Bajpai","initials":"A","foreName":"Anjali"},{"lastName":"Alam","initials":"MA","foreName":"Mohammad Atif"},{"lastName":"Gupta","initials":"RP","foreName":"Ram P"},{"lastName":"Harsh","initials":"S","foreName":"Sneh"},{"lastName":"Pandey","initials":"RK","foreName":"Ravi K"},{"lastName":"Goel-Bhattacharya","initials":"S","foreName":"Surbhi"},{"lastName":"Nigam","initials":"A","foreName":"Aditi"},{"lastName":"Mishra","initials":"A","foreName":"Arati"},{"lastName":"Sinha","initials":"P","foreName":"Pradip"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15847,"articleTitle":"Choline treatment affects the liver reticuloendothelial system and plasma fatty acid composition in diabetic rats.","dateCreated":"2013-05-22","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1475-097X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Clinical physiology and functional imaging","isoAbbreviation":"Clin Physiol Funct Imaging"},"articleDate":"2013-01-24","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"This study investigated effects of choline treatment on hepatic reticuloendothelial and biliary functions and plasma fatty acid composition in diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ).

Physically activated PSACs were produced by pyrolysis at 700°C under N followed by activation with steam or CO at 700 to 900°C.

The average mass yield of PSACs with respect to the initial mass of the biomass was about 20 and 34% for physically activated and chemically activated carbons, respectively. Acid-activated carbons exhibited higher surface area, higher bulk density, and lower ash content compared with steam- or CO-activated carbons and the two commercial products. Base activation led to the development of biochar with moderate to high surface area with surface charges suitable for adsorption of anionic species.

Our results also showed that PSACs were effective in removing inorganic contaminants such as Cu and NO as well as organic contaminants such as atrazine and metolachlor.

In this review we discuss a limited number of topics within the PCP field, chosen because they are difficult, unsolved, controversial or just because we find them interesting. Because Drosophila is the best studied and technically most amenable system we have concentrated on it, but also consider some examples from work on vertebrates. Topics discussed include the number of genetic pathways involved in PCP, as well as the causal relationship between embryonic axes, gradients of morphogens and PCP itself. We consider the vexed question of the roles of the Wnt genes in PCP in both vertebrates and Drosophila. We discuss whether the proteins involved in PCP need to be localised asymmetrically in cells in order to function.

Understanding the regulation of the Hippo pathway and discovering upstream regulators is thus a major quest. Interestingly, while the core of the Hippo pathway contains a highly conserved kinase cascade, different components have been identified as upstream regulators in Drosophila and vertebrates. However, whether the regulation of the Hippo pathway is indeed different between Drosophila and vertebrates or whether these differences are due to our limited analysis of these components in different organisms is not known. Here we show that the mouse Fat4 cadherin, the ortholog of the Hippo pathway regulator Fat in Drosophila, does not apparently regulate the Hippo pathway in the murine liver. In fact, we uncovered an evolutionary shift in many of the known upstream regulators at the base of the arthropod lineage. In this evolutionary transition, Fat and the adaptor protein Expanded gained novel domains that connected them to the Hippo pathway, whereas the cell-adhesion receptor Echinoid evolved as a new protein. Subsequently, the junctional adaptor protein Angiomotin (Amot) was lost and the downstream effector Yap lost its PDZ-binding motif that interacts with cell junction proteins.

However, in these models, each single node represents one disease or an ambiguous group of diseases. In these cases, the notion of diseases as unique entities reduces the usefulness of network-based methods. We hypothesize that using the clinical features (pathophenotypes) to define pathophenotypic connections between disease-causing genes improve our understanding of the molecular events originated by genetic disturbances. For this, we have built a pathophenotypic similarity gene network (PSGN) and compared it with the unipartite projections (based on gene-to-gene edges) similar to those used in previous network models (HDN and ODN). Unlike these disease network models, the PSGN uses semantic similarities. This pathophenotypic similarity has been calculated by comparing pathophenotypic annotations of genes (human abnormalities of HPO terms) in the \"Human Phenotype Ontology\". The resulting network contains 1075 genes (nodes) and 26197 significant pathophenotypic similarities (edges). A global analysis of this network reveals: unnoticed pairs of genes showing significant pathophenotypic similarity, a biological meaningful re-arrangement of the pathological relationships between genes, correlations of biochemical interactions with higher similarity scores and functional biases in metabolic and essential genes toward the pathophenotypic specificity and the pleiotropy, respectively.

In the Drosophila optic lobe, neuroepithelial cells first divide symmetrically to expand the stem cell population and then transform into asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts, which generate medulla neurons. The mechanisms underlying this cell fate transition are not well understood. Here, we show a crucial role of some cell cycle regulators in this transition. We find that loss of function in replication protein A (RPA), which consists of three highly conserved protein subunits and functions in DNA replication, leads to disintegration of the optic lobe neuroepithelium and premature differentiation of neuroepithelial cells into medulla neuroblasts. Clonal analyses of RPA loss-of-function alleles indicate that RPA is required to prevent neuroepithelial cells from differentiating into medulla neuroblasts. Inactivation of the core cell cycle regulators, including the G1/S regulators E2F1, Cyclin E, Cdk2, and PCNA, and the G2/M regulators Cyclin A, Cyclin B, and Cdk1, mimic RPA loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that cell cycle progression is required for both maintaining neuroepithelial cell identity and suppressing neuroblast formation. We further find that RPA or E2F1 inactivation in the neuroepithelial cells correlates with downregulation of Notch signaling activity, which appears to result from Numb mislocalization. Thus, we have shown that the transition from neuroepithelial cells to neuroblasts is directly regulated by cell cycle regulators and propose a model in which the inhibition of neuroepithelial cell cycle progression downregulates Notch signaling activity through Numb, which leads to the onset of neurogenesis.","PMID":23407946,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhou","initials":"L","foreName":"Liya"},{"lastName":"Luo","initials":"H","foreName":"Hong"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15782,"articleTitle":"In vitro polyphenolics erythrocyte model and in vivo chicken embryo model revealed gallic acid to be a potential hemorrhage inducer: physicochemical action mechanisms.","dateCreated":"2013-03-18","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5010","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemical research in toxicology","isoAbbreviation":"Chem.

Levels of the gene hif-1α, HIF-1α, TNF-α, IL-6, and NFκB in cervical muscles were all significantly upregulated, while the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was downregulated in a dose-responsive manner. Consequently, the cervical muscle inflammation and hemolysis could have been stimulated en route to the tissue TNF-α-canonical and the atypical pathways. We hypothesized that GA could deplete the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the expense of semiquinone and quinone formation, favoring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to induce RBC disruption and Fe(2+) ion release. To explore this, the in vitro polyphenolics-erythrocyte model (PEM) was established. PEM revealed that the DO was rapidly depleted, leading to the release of a huge amount of Fe (II) ions and hydrogen peroxide (HPO) in a two-phase kinetic pattern. The kinetic coefficients for Fe (II) ion release ranged from 0.347 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1); and those for Fe (III) ion production were from 6.66 × 10(-3) h(-1) to 8.93 × 10(-3) h(-1). For phase I HPO production, they ranged from 0.236 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1) and for phase II HPO production from 0.764 h(-1) to 2.560 h(-1) at GA within 6 μM to 14 μM. Thus, evidence obtained from PEM could strongly support the phenomena of CEM. To conclude, GA tends to elicit hypoxia-related inflammation and hemolysis in chicken cervical muscles through its extremely high prooxidant activity.","PMID":23406025,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ker","initials":"YB","foreName":"Yaw-Bee"},{"lastName":"Peng","initials":"CC","foreName":"Chiung-Chi"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"CH","foreName":"Chien-Hong"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"KC","foreName":"Kuan-Chou"},{"lastName":"Hsieh","initials":"CL","foreName":"Chiu-Lan"},{"lastName":"Peng","initials":"RY","foreName":"Robert Y"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15803,"articleTitle":"Acclimation responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to sustained phosphite treatments.","dateCreated":"2013-04-08","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1460-2431","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of experimental botany","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Because of its close structural resemblance to phosphate, phosphite impairs the sensing, membrane transport, and subcellular compartmentation of phosphate. In addition, phosphite induces plant defence responses by an as yet unknown mode of action. In this study, the acclimation of Arabidopsis thaliana plants to a sustained phosphite supply in the growth medium was investigated and compared with plants growing under varying phosphate supplies. Unlike phosphate, phosphite did not suppress the formation of lateral roots in several Arabidopsis accessions. In addition, the expression of well-documented phosphate-starvation-induced genes, such as miRNA399d and At4, was not repressed by phosphite accumulation, whilst the induction of PHT1;1 and PAP1 was accentuated. Thus, a mimicking of phosphate by phosphite was not observed for these classical phosphate-starvation responses. Metabolomic analysis of phosphite-treated plants showed changes in several metabolite pools, most prominently those of aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, and serine. These alterations in amino acid pools provide novel insights for the understanding of phosphite-induced pathogen resistance.","PMID":23404904,"authors":[{"lastName":"Berkowitz","initials":"O","foreName":"Oliver"},{"lastName":"Jost","initials":"R","foreName":"Ricarda"},{"lastName":"Kollehn","initials":"DO","foreName":"Daniel O"},{"lastName":"Fenske","initials":"R","foreName":"Ricarda"},{"lastName":"Finnegan","initials":"PM","foreName":"Patrick M"},{"lastName":"O'Brien","initials":"PA","foreName":"Philip A"},{"lastName":"Hardy","initials":"GE","foreName":"Giles E St J"},{"lastName":"Lambers","initials":"H","foreName":"Hans"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15744,"articleTitle":"Intestinal regeneration: YAP-tumor suppressor and oncoprotein?","dateCreated":"2013-02-08","dateRevised":"2013-02-08","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0445","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

The regulation of Yki and YAP by the Hippo signaling pathway has been extensively investigated; however, how they regulate gene expression is poorly understood. To identify additional regulators of Yki activity, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells. In this screen, we identified the conserved protein Mask (Multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain) as a novel promoter of Yki activity in vitro and validated this function in vivo in Drosophila. We found that Mask is required downstream of the Hippo pathway for Yki to induce target-gene expression and that Mask forms complexes with Yki. The human Mask homolog MASK1 complexes with YAP and is required for the full activity of YAP. Additionally, elevated MASK1 expression is associated with worsened outcomes for breast cancer patients.

It is expressed as two mRNA splice variants, Nore1A and a shorter isoform, Nore1B. It forms homo- and heterocomplexes through its C-terminal SARAH (Sav/Rassf/Hpo) domain. The oligomeric state of Nore1 and other SARAH domain-containing proteins is important for their cellular activities. However, there are few experimental data addressing the structural and biophysical characterization of these domains. In this study, we show that the recombinant SARAH domain of Nore1 crystallizes as an antiparallel homodimer with representative characteristics of coiled coils. As is typical for coiled coils, the SARAH domain shows a heptad register, yet the heptad register is interrupted by two stutters. The comparisons of the heptad register of Nore1-SARAH with the primary structure of Rassf1-4, Rassf6, MST1, MST2, and WW45 indicate that these proteins have a heptad register interrupted by two stutters, too. Moreover, on the basis of the structure of Nore1-SARAH, we also generate structural models for Rassf1 and Rassf3. These models indicate that Rassf1- and Rassf3-SARAH form structures very similar to that of Nore1-SARAH. In addition, we show that, as we have previously found for MST1, the SARAH domain of Nore1 undergoes association-dependent folding. Nevertheless, the Nore1 homodimer has a lower affinity and thermodynamic stability than the MST1 homodimer, while the monomer is slightly more stable. Our experimental results along with our theoretical considerations indicate that the SARAH domain is merely a dimerization domain and that the differences between the individual sequences lead to different stabilities and affinities that might have an important functional role.","PMID":23331050,"authors":[{"lastName":"Makbul","initials":"C","foreName":"Cihan"},{"lastName":"Constantinescu Aruxandei","initials":"D","foreName":"Diana"},{"lastName":"Hofmann","initials":"E","foreName":"Eckhard"},{"lastName":"Schwarz","initials":"D","foreName":"Daniel"},{"lastName":"Wolf","initials":"E","foreName":"Eva"},{"lastName":"Herrmann","initials":"C","foreName":"Christian"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15720,"articleTitle":"Optimization of fermentation conditions and properties of an exopolysaccharide from Klebsiella sp.

However, how the Hpo kinase is regulated during development has not been clearly understood. Using a Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assay, we have investigated the functional significance of Hpo homo-dimer formation and subcellular localization in living cells. We found that Hpo dimerization and membrane association are critical for its activation in growth inhibition. As dimerization facilitates Hpo to access its binding partner, Hpo kinases in the homo-dimer trans-phosphorylate each other to increase their enzymatic activity. Moreover, loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate that upstream regulators, Expanded, Merlin and Kibra, play a critical role in promoting Hpo dimerization as well as association to the cortical F-actin beneath the plasma membrane. Enforced Hpo localization to the plasma membrane increases Hpo dimerization and activity. Therefore, homo-dimerization and plasma membrane association are two important mechanisms for Hpo activation in growth control during animal development.","PMID":23298890,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yaoting"},{"lastName":"Matsui","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yurika"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yifan"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"ZC","foreName":"Zhi-Chun"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15741,"articleTitle":"Antipyrine based arsenate selective fluorescent probe for living cell imaging.","dateCreated":"2013-02-05","dateRevised":"2013-02-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-6882","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Analytical chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Anal.

A comparison of the second-order rate constants for the OMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylations of FEO (10 M\u207b¹ s\u207b¹) and 1-(β-d-erythrofuranosyl)orotic acid (EO, 0.026 M\u207b¹ s\u207b¹) shows that the vinyl carbanion-like transition state is stabilized by 3.5 kcal/mol by interactions with the 5-F substituent of FEO. The OMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylations of FEO and EO are both activated by exogenous phosphite dianion (HPO\u2083²\u207b), but the 5-F substituent results in only a 0.8 kcal stabilization of the transition state for the phosphite-activated reaction of FEO. This provides strong evidence that the phosphite-activated OMPDC-catalyzed reaction of FEO is not limited by the chemical step of decarboxylation of the enzyme-bound substrate. Evidence is presented that there is a change in the rate-limiting step from the chemical step of decarboxylation for the phosphite-activated reaction of EO, to closure of the phosphate gripper loop and an enzyme conformational change at the ternary E\u2022FEO\u2022HPO\u2083²\u207b complex for the reaction of FEO.

YKI is the downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that plays a key role in the control of tissue growth. The core components of this pathway are two kinases, Hippo (HPO) and Warts (WTS), which negatively regulate the activity of the SD/YKI complex, retaining YKI in the cytoplasm. We previously showed that HPO kinase can also reduce SD/VG transcriptional activity in Drosophila S2 cells. We further investigated the relationship between the SD/VG complex and the Hippo pathway. We show here that HPO overexpression suppresses overgrowth induced by SD/VG in vivo during Drosophila development. Using S2 cells, we show that HPO promotes the translocation of SD to the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the induction of SD/VG target genes. Using RNAi-mediated depletion of yki and a mutant SD protein unable to interact with YKI, we demonstrate that HPO regulates SD localization independently of YKI. This function requires HPO kinase activity, yet surprisingly, not its downstream effector kinase WTS.

The pathway core is a kinase cassette, comprising the kinases Hpo and Warts (Wts) and the scaffold proteins Salvador (Sav) and Mats, which inactivates the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki). We performed a split-TEV-based genome-wide RNAi screen for modulators of Hpo signalling.

As Sik kinases have been implicated in nutrient sensing, this suggests a link between the Hpo pathway and systemic growth control.","PMID":23263283,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wehr","initials":"MC","foreName":"Michael C"},{"lastName":"Holder","initials":"MV","foreName":"Maxine V"},{"lastName":"Gailite","initials":"I","foreName":"Ieva"},{"lastName":"Saunders","initials":"RE","foreName":"Rebecca E"},{"lastName":"Maile","initials":"TM","foreName":"Tobias M"},{"lastName":"Ciirdaeva","initials":"E","foreName":"Elena"},{"lastName":"Instrell","initials":"R","foreName":"Rachael"},{"lastName":"Jiang","initials":"M","foreName":"Ming"},{"lastName":"Howell","initials":"M","foreName":"Michael"},{"lastName":"Rossner","initials":"MJ","foreName":"Moritz J"},{"lastName":"Tapon","initials":"N","foreName":"Nicolas"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15733,"articleTitle":"Formation of haloacetic acids from dissolved organic matter fractions during chloramination.","dateCreated":"2013-01-28","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-2448","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Water research","isoAbbreviation":"Water Res."},"articleDate":"2012-11-30","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The objective of this study was to investigate the roles of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions, pH and bromide concentration in the formation of haloacetic acids (HAA) during chloramination. DOM from two surface waters with a low (2.9 L/mg-m) and high (5.1 L/mg-m) specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) values was isolated and fractionated into three fractions based on the hydrophobicity [i.e., hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPH) and hydrophilic (HPI)]. DOM mass balances and DBP reactivity checks were performed to characterize the effects of isolation and fractionation steps. The fractions were chloraminated at three pHs and three bromide concentrations. The results showed that pH was the most important factor controlling HAA formation and speciation. The HAA yields significantly decreased with increase in pH from 6.3 to 9.0. The impact of bromide in the formation of brominated HAA species also became less important with increasing pH, and no brominated specie was detectable at pH 9. HPO fractions of the two source waters consistently showed higher HAA yields than TPH and HPI fractions. On the other hand, HPI fractions showed higher bromine incorporation than HPO and TPH fractions. To maintain higher and relatively stable combined chlorine residuals while reducing HAA formation, water utilities may consider keeping pH above 7.5 as one strategy. This will also lower the formation of brominated HAA species which have been shown to be more cyto- and geno-toxic than their chlorinated analogs.","PMID":23245540,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hong","initials":"Y","foreName":"Ying"},{"lastName":"Song","initials":"H","foreName":"Hocheol"},{"lastName":"Karanfil","initials":"T","foreName":"Tanju"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15761,"articleTitle":"Semantically enabling a genome-wide association study database.","dateCreated":"2013-02-25","dateRevised":"2013-04-18","publication":{"issnNumber":"2041-1480","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of biomedical semantics","isoAbbreviation":"J Biomed Semantics"},"articleDate":"2012-12-17","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The amount of data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has grown rapidly, but considerations for GWAS phenotype data reuse and interchange have not kept pace. This impacts on the work of GWAS Central - a free and open access resource for the advanced querying and comparison of summary-level genetic association data. The benefits of employing ontologies for standardising and structuring data are widely accepted. The complex spectrum of observed human phenotypes (and traits), and the requirement for cross-species phenotype comparisons, calls for reflection on the most appropriate solution for the organisation of human phenotype data. The Semantic Web provides standards for the possibility of further integration of GWAS data and the ability to contribute to the web of Linked Data.A pragmatic consideration when applying phenotype ontologies to GWAS data is the ability to retrieve all data, at the most granular level possible, from querying a single ontology graph. We found the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terminology suitable for describing all traits (diseases and medical signs and symptoms) at various levels of granularity and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) most suitable for describing phenotypic abnormalities (medical signs and symptoms) at the most granular level. Diseases within MeSH are mapped to HPO to infer the phenotypic abnormalities associated with diseases. Building on the rich semantic phenotype annotation layer, we are able to make cross-species phenotype comparisons and publish a core subset of GWAS data as RDF nanopublications.We present a methodology for applying phenotype annotations to a comprehensive genome-wide association dataset and for ensuring compatibility with the Semantic Web. The annotations are used to assist with cross-species genotype and phenotype comparisons. However, further processing and deconstructions of terms may be required to facilitate automatic phenotype comparisons. The provision of GWAS nanopublications enables a new dimension for exploring GWAS data, by way of intrinsic links to related data resources within the Linked Data web. The value of such annotation and integration will grow as more biomedical resources adopt the standards of the Semantic Web.","PMID":23244533,"authors":[{"lastName":"Beck","initials":"T","foreName":"Tim"},{"lastName":"Free","initials":"RC","foreName":"Robert C"},{"lastName":"Thorisson","initials":"GA","foreName":"Gudmundur A"},{"lastName":"Brookes","initials":"AJ","foreName":"Anthony J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15733,"articleTitle":"Positional dependence of the CT number with use of a cone-beam CT scanner for an electron density phantom in particle beam therapy.","dateCreated":"2013-01-28","dateRevised":"2015-10-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1865-0341","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Radiological physics and technology","isoAbbreviation":"Radiol Phys Technol"},"articleDate":"2012-12-16","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We evaluated the CT number accuracy in determining a CT calibration method for treatment planning by use of a 256 multi-slice CT (MSCT) scanner.

We inserted four types of samples (air, 100 % ethanol, 40 wt% aqueous K(2)HPO(4), and water) into the phantom. The regions of interest were set for all image slices, and the average CT number was calculated in the transverse and longitudinal sections. For the transverse image direction, the CT number became lower toward the center of the phantom with almost all samples. The causes of these phenomena might be attributed to the effects of scattered radiation and those of beam hardening due to the high-atomic-number material (40 wt% aqueous K(2)HPO(4)). However, the phenomena were too complicated to allow us to determine their causes only from the present studies. Meanwhile, for increasing the accuracy of the CT number calibration, a single sample should be inserted, and this step should be repeated with different samples. For the longitudinal direction, the CT number for a 40 wt % aqueous K(2)HPO(4) sample increased by 30 HU from the anode to the cathode side due to variations in the X-ray energy caused by the heel effect.

Thymol was found to efficiently scavenge OH radicals (k = 8.1 × 10(9) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)) to produce reducing adduct radicals, with an absorption maximum at 330 nm and oxidizing phenoxyl radicals, with absorption maxima at 390 and 410 nm. A major part of these adduct radicals was found to undergo water elimination, leading to phenoxyl radicals, and the process was catalyzed by OH(-) (or Na(2)HPO(4)). The rate of reaction of O(\u2022-) with thymol was found to be comparatively low (k = 1.1 × 10(9) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)), producing H abstracted species of thymol as well as phenoxyl radicals. Further, these phenoxyl radicals of thymol were found to be repaired by ascorbate (k = 2.1 × 10(8) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)). To support the interpretation of the experimental results, DFT calculations were carried out. The transients (both adducts and H abstracted species) have been optimized in gas phase at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of calculation. The relative energy values and thermodynamic stability suggests that the ortho adduct (C6_OH adduct) to be most stable in the reaction of thymol with OH radicals, which favors the water elimination. However, theoretical calculations showed that C4 atom in thymol (para position) can also be the reaction center as it is the main contributor of HOMO. The absorption maxima (λ(max)) calculated from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for these transient species were close to those obtained experimentally. Finally, the redox potential value of thymol(\u2022)/thymol couple (0.98 V vs NHE) obtained by cyclic voltammetry is less than those of physiologically important oxidants, which reveals the antioxidant capacity of thymol, by scavenging these oxidants. The repair of the phenoxyl radicals of thymol with ascorbate together with the redox potential value makes it a potent antioxidant with minimum pro-oxidant effects.","PMID":23240914,"authors":[{"lastName":"Venu","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Naik","initials":"DB","foreName":"D B"},{"lastName":"Sarkar","initials":"SK","foreName":"S K"},{"lastName":"Aravind","initials":"UK","foreName":"Usha K"},{"lastName":"Nijamudheen","initials":"A","foreName":"A"},{"lastName":"Aravindakumar","initials":"CT","foreName":"C T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15712,"articleTitle":"Time-resolved assembly of chiral uranyl peroxo cage clusters containing belts of polyhedra.","dateCreated":"2013-01-07","dateRevised":"2013-01-07","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-510X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2012-12-11","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Two chiral cage clusters built from uranyl polyhedra and (HPO(3))(2-) groups have been synthesized in pure yield and characterized structurally and spectroscopically in the solid state and aqueous solution.

Bfrs contribute to regulate iron homeostasis in bacteria by capturing soluble but potentially toxic Fe(2+) and by compartmentalizing it in the form of a bioavailable ferric mineral inside the protein's hollow cavity. When iron is needed, Fe(3+) is reduced and mobilized into the cytosol as Fe(2+). Hence, key to the function of Bfr is its ability to permeate iron ions in and out of its interior cavity, which is likely imparted by a flexible protein shell. To examine the conformational flexibility of Bfrs in a native-like environment and the way in which the protein shell interacts with monovalent cations, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of BfrB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa BfrB) in K(2)HPO(4) solutions at different ionic strengths. The results indicate the presence of coupled thermal fluctuations (dynamics) in the 4-fold pores and B-pores of the protein, which is key to allowing passage of monovalent cations through the protein shell using B-pores as conduits. The MD simulations also show that Pa BfrB ferroxidase centers are highly dynamic and permanently populated by transient cations exchanging with other cations in the interior cavity, as well as the solution bathing the protein. Taken together, the findings suggest that Fe(2+) passes across the Pa BfrB shell via B-pores and that the ferroxidase pores allow the capture and oxidation of Fe(2+), followed by translocation of Fe(3+) to the interior cavity, aided by the conformationally active H130.","PMID":23167635,"authors":[{"lastName":"Rui","initials":"H","foreName":"Huan"},{"lastName":"Rivera","initials":"M","foreName":"Mario"},{"lastName":"Im","initials":"W","foreName":"Wonpil"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15709,"articleTitle":"Transition metal-induced self-assembly of small molybdenum clusters.","dateCreated":"2013-01-04","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1477-9234","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)","isoAbbreviation":"Dalton Trans"},"articleDate":"2012-11-19","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The first-row transition metals (TMs) are applied to induce the assembly of small molybdenum clusters (SMCs) in the molybdenum/TM/phosphate system, and eight SMC-based compounds are synthesized: [(V(2)O(2))(H(2)PMo(8)V(4)O(40))]·2(en)·12H(2)O (1), [CrMo(6)O(18)(OH)(6)]·1.5(H(2)en)·5H(2)O (2), [MnMo(12)O(24)(OH)(6)(HPO(4))(2)(PO(4))(6)]·7(H(2)en)·6H(2)O (3), {[Co(H(2)O)](2)[CoMo(12)O(24)(OH)(6)(H(2)PO(4))(2)(PO(4))(6)]}·4(H(2)en)·4H(2)O (4), [Ni(5)(H(2)O)(22)(Mo(2)O(4))(8)(HPO(4))(20)(PO(4))(6)]·32H(2)O (5), Cu(2)(en)(4)(Mo(8)O(26)) (6), [Cu(en)(2)Mo(5)O(15)(HPO(4))(2)]·(H(2)en)·2H(2)O (7) and {Zn(2)[Na(H(2)O)(2)][NaMo(12)O(24)(OH)(6)(H(2)PO(4))(6)(PO(4))(2)]}·5(en)·11H(2)O (8) (en = ethylenediamine).

In order to quantify both APIs, chlorine (Cl) concentration was estimated by employing the Cl/Br optical emission ratio, where Br was introduced as internal standard. Calibration curves were prepared, achieving linearity higher than 99%. On the other hand, for comparison to the proposed method, an isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was also developed for quantitative determination of the same analytes by ultraviolet (UV) detection. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Phenomenex Hypersil C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm column. The mobile phase was K(2)HPO(4)/H(3)PO(4)-CH(3)OH and flow rate was 1.0 mL min(-1).

FASI basically consists in a mismatch between the electric conductivity of the sample and that of the running buffer and it is achieved by electrokinetically injecting the sample diluted in a solvent of lower conductivity than that of the carrier electrolyte. Ultrapure water resulted to be the better sample solvent to reach the greatest enhancement factor. Injection voltage and time have been optimized to 5 kV and 20s, respectively.

Imaginal disc cells mutant for the tumor-suppressor gene scribble (scrib) lose apical-basal polarity and have the potential to form large neoplastic tumors. Interestingly, when scrib mutant (scrib(-)) cells are surrounded by normal cells the scrib(-) population is eliminated. However, the signals and mechanisms that cause the elimination of clones of scrib(-) cells are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the role of Stat, a component of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, in tissues with clones of scrib(-) cells. We found that Stat activity is required in normal cells for the elimination of neighboring scrib(-) cells. Importantly, these competitive defects of stat mutant cells are not simply due to defects in cell proliferation because even stat(-) cells manipulated to hyperproliferate are unable to eliminate scrib(-) cells. These data identify Stat activity as a critical determinant of whether or not a tissue can eliminate abnormal cells and provide an important step forward in understanding the complex network of signals operating in and around tumorigenic cells.","PMID":23108407,"authors":[{"lastName":"Schroeder","initials":"MC","foreName":"M C"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"CL","foreName":"C-L"},{"lastName":"Gajewski","initials":"K","foreName":"K"},{"lastName":"Halder","initials":"G","foreName":"G"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15657,"articleTitle":"Divalent-anion salt effects in polyelectrolyte multilayer depositions.","dateCreated":"2012-11-13","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5827","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","isoAbbreviation":"Langmuir"},"articleDate":"2012-10-29","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We systematically investigate the effects of divalent anions on the assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayers by fabricating polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)/polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) multilayer films from aqueous solutions containing SO(4)(2-), HPO(4)(2-), or organic dicarboxylate dianions.

This dynamics-based methodology in which the solvent is treated explicitly at the ab initio level has been compared with more commonly used simple, static, approaches. Comparison with experimental numbers has confirmed that the AIMD-based approach predicts the correct trend in the pKa values and produces the lowest average error (∼0.3 pKa units). The corresponding pKa predictions made via static quantum mechanical calculations overestimate the pKa values by 0.3-7 pKa units, with the extent of error dependent on the choice of thermodynamic cycle employed. The use of simple quantitative structure property relationship methods gives prediction errors of 0.3-1 pKa units, with some values overestimated and some underestimated. Beyond merely calculating pKa values, the AIMD simulations provide valuable additional insight into the atomistic details of the proton transfer mechanism and the solvation structure and dynamics at all stages of the reaction. For all HPOs studied, it is seen that proton transfer takes place along a chain of three H2O molecules, although direct hydrogen bonds are seen to form transiently. Analysis of the solvation structure before and after the proton transfer event using radial pair distribution functions and integrated number densities suggests that the trends in the pKa values correlate with the strength of the hydrogen bond and the average number of solvent molecules in the vicinity of the donor oxygen.","PMID":26292237,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"YL","foreName":"Yu-Lin"},{"lastName":"Doltsinis","initials":"NL","foreName":"Nikos L"},{"lastName":"Hider","initials":"RC","foreName":"Robert C"},{"lastName":"Barlow","initials":"DJ","foreName":"Dave J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15664,"articleTitle":"Drosophila GAGA factor is required for full activation of the dE2f1-Yki/Sd transcriptional program.","dateCreated":"2012-11-20","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1551-4005","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","isoAbbreviation":"Cell Cycle"},"articleDate":"2012-10-15","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size by controlling the activity of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki).

In addition, transcription factor dE2f1, of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway, cooperates with Yki/Sd to synergistically activate a set of common cell cycle target genes. However, little is known about other factors that ensure the proper transcriptional output of Hippo signaling. In this report we identified the chromatin protein GAGA factor (GAF), which is encoded by the Trithorax-like (Trl) gene, as a novel and critical partner in transcriptional regulation by Yki/Sd and dE2f1. We show that GAF is required for the full activation of target genes by dE2f1 and Yki/Sd; while ablation of GAF compromises both normal and inappropriate cell proliferation driven by Yki and dE2f1 in multiple tissues. The importance of GAF is further supported by strong genetic interactions between GAF and the Rb and Hippo pathways. Additionally, we show that GAF directly interacts with RBF, a Drosophila pRB homolog, and partially co-localizes with RBF on polytene chromosomes.

Recent evidence suggests that these pathways often intersect and regulate one another to elicit an appropriate response to a complex set of stimuli. Two pathways known to be important for development, growth, and homeostasis are the Wnt/β-catenin and the Hippo/YAP pathways. Growing data indicate that these two pathways influence each other in a number of ways to properly regulate tissue growth and repair. Deregulation of these pathways often contributes to tumorigenesis. In this review, we will discuss the points of intersection between the Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways and how these interactions contribute to homeostasis, organ repair, and tumorigenesis.","PMID":23027379,"authors":[{"lastName":"Konsavage","initials":"WM","foreName":"Wesley M"},{"lastName":"Yochum","initials":"GS","foreName":"Gregory S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15639,"articleTitle":"Mitochondrial defect drives non-autonomous tumour progression through Hippo signalling in Drosophila.","dateCreated":"2012-10-26","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1476-4687","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nature","isoAbbreviation":"Nature"},"articleDate":"2012-09-30","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Mitochondrial respiratory function is frequently impaired in human cancers. However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to tumour progression remain elusive. Here we show in Drosophila imaginal epithelium that defects in mitochondrial function potently induce tumour progression of surrounding tissue in conjunction with oncogenic Ras. Our data show that Ras activation and mitochondrial dysfunction cooperatively stimulate production of reactive oxygen species, which causes activation of c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling. JNK cooperates with oncogenic Ras to inactivate the Hippo pathway, leading to upregulation of its targets Unpaired (an interleukin-6 homologue) and Wingless (a Wnt homologue). Mitochondrial dysfunction in Ras-activated cells further cooperates with Ras signalling in neighbouring cells with normal mitochondrial function, causing benign tumours to exhibit metastatic behaviour. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for interclonal tumour progression driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and oncogenic Ras.","PMID":23023132,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ohsawa","initials":"S","foreName":"Shizue"},{"lastName":"Sato","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yoshitaka"},{"lastName":"Enomoto","initials":"M","foreName":"Masato"},{"lastName":"Nakamura","initials":"M","foreName":"Mai"},{"lastName":"Betsumiya","initials":"A","foreName":"Aya"},{"lastName":"Igaki","initials":"T","foreName":"Tatsushi"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":16260,"articleTitle":"Capillary electrophoretic profiling of tryptic digests of water soluble proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis-transgenic and non-transgenic maize species.","dateCreated":"2014-07-09","dateRevised":"2017-04-18","publication":{"issnNumber":"0308-8146","issnType":"Print","title":"Food chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Food Chem"},"articleDate":"2012-03-16","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) has been applied to separation and characterisation of enzymatic (tryptic) hydrolysates of water-soluble proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-transgenic (Aristis-Bt) and two native non-transgenic (Aristis and Coventry) maize varieties.

Based on the biochemical composition and FT-IR analysis, the flocculant compound was predicted as a polysaccharide derivative. The flocculating activity of the MSBF17 was invariably considerable at high salinity and temperature. It was found that the nano-scale silver can be synthesized in reverse micelles using the bioflocculant as stabilizer. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were characterized by UV-spectroscopy, FT-IR and TEM analysis. The AgNPs were spherical shaped (60 nm) and stable for 5 months.

Binding energies of monodentate and bidentate HPO(4)(2-) surface complexes were compared to H(2)PO(4)(-) outer-sphere complexes. Both the average potential energies from DFT molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations and energy minimizations were used to estimate adsorption energies for each configuration. Molecular clusters were extracted from the energy-minimized structures of the periodic systems and subjected to energy reminimization and frequency analysis with MO-DFT. The modeled P-O and P---Fe distances were consistent with EXAFS data for the arsenate oxyanion that is an analog of phosphate, and the interatomic distances predicted by the clusters were similar to those of the periodic models. Calculated vibrational frequencies from these clusters were then correlated with observed infrared bands. Configurations that resulted in favorable adsorption energies were also found to produce theoretical vibrational frequencies that correlated well with experiment. The relative stability of monodentate versus bidentate configurations was a function of the goethite surface under consideration. Overall, our results show that phosphate adsorption onto goethite occurs as a variety of surface complexes depending on the habit of the mineral (i.e., surfaces present) and solution pH. Previous IR spectroscopic studies may have been difficult to interpret because the observed spectra averaged the structural properties of three or more configurations on any given sample with multiple surfaces.","PMID":22985265,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kubicki","initials":"JD","foreName":"James D"},{"lastName":"Paul","initials":"KW","foreName":"Kristian W"},{"lastName":"Kabalan","initials":"L","foreName":"Lara"},{"lastName":"Zhu","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qing"},{"lastName":"Mrozik","initials":"MK","foreName":"Michael K"},{"lastName":"Aryanpour","initials":"M","foreName":"Masoud"},{"lastName":"Pierre-Louis","initials":"AM","foreName":"Andro-Marc"},{"lastName":"Strongin","initials":"DR","foreName":"Daniel R"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15614,"articleTitle":"Removal of boron from wastewater by the hydroxyapatite formation reaction using acceleration effect of ammonia.","dateCreated":"2012-10-01","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3336","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of hazardous materials","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The removal rate of boron was controlled by the HAp precipitate formation and the presence of ammonia. From the XRD patterns and SEM images, HAp could be confirmed in the precipitate product. The reaction between borate ions and calcium hydroxide was accelerated by dehydration with ammonia; the borate-calcium hydroxide compound coprecipitated with resulting HAp. Although the removal of boron decreased in the presence of sulfate, phosphate, and aluminum, these effects could be prevented by adding excess Ca(OH)(2). Interference of fluoride ions was eliminated by adding Al(3+). Sodium alpha-olefin sulfonate was the most effective coagulant for HAp precipitation.

The minor products include styrene and phenylethanol (1-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethanol), which appear at higher temperatures and longer batch holding times. Phenylethylamine forms via decarboxylation of phenylalanine, styrene forms via deamination of phenylethylamine, and phenylethanol forms via hydration of styrene. We quantified the molar yields of each product at the four temperatures, and the carbon recovery was between 80-100\u2009% for most cases. Phenylalanine disappearance follows first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 144 ± 14\u2005kJ\u2009mol\u207b¹ and a pre-exponential factor of 10(12.4 ± 1.4) \u2005min\u207b¹. A kinetics model based on the proposed pathways was consistent with the experimental data. Effects of five different salts (NaCl, NaNO\u2083, Na\u2082 SO\u2084, KCl, K\u2082 HPO\u2084) and boric acid (H\u2083BO\u2083) on phenylalanine behavior at 250\u2009°C have also been elucidated. These additives increase phenylalanine conversion, but decrease the yield of phenylethylamine presumably by promoting formation of high molecular weight compounds. Lastly, binary mixtures of phenylalanine and ethyl oleate have been studied at 350\u2009°C and three different molar concentration ratios. The presence of phenylalanine enhances the conversion of ethyl oleate and molar yields of fatty acid. Higher concentration of ethyl oleate leads to increased deamination of phenylethylamine and hydration of styrene. Amides are also formed due to the interaction of oleic acid/ethyl oleate and phenylethylamine/ammonia and lead to a decrease in the fatty acid yields. Taken collectively, these results provide new insights into the reactions of algae during its hydrothermal liquefaction to produce crude bio-oil.","PMID":22927034,"authors":[{"lastName":"Changi","initials":"S","foreName":"Shujauddin"},{"lastName":"Zhu","initials":"M","foreName":"Minghan"},{"lastName":"Savage","initials":"PE","foreName":"Phillip E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15593,"articleTitle":"Textural properties and surface chemistry of lotus stalk-derived activated carbons prepared using different phosphorus oxyacids: adsorption of trimethoprim.","dateCreated":"2012-09-10","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3336","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of hazardous materials","isoAbbreviation":"J.

In the present study, we provide novel data indicating the presence and regulatory effects of nesfatin-1 on the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis of goldfish. Nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2)/nesfatin-1-like immunoreactive (ir) cells are present in the hypothalamus and in the pituitary, suggesting a hypophysiotropic role for nesfatin-1. NUCB2/nesfatin-1-like ir cells colocalize gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the nucleus lateralis tuberis posterioris and the nucleus anterior tuberis of the goldfish hypothalamus. The presence of nesfatin-1 with GnRH in these two nuclei implicated in pituitary hormone release suggests a role for nesfatin-1 on gonadotropin secretion. A single i.p. injection of synthetic goldfish nesfatin-1 (50 ng/g body wt) resulted in an acute decrease (∼75%) in the expression of hypothalamic chicken GnRH-II and salmon GnRH mRNAs at 15 min postinjection in goldfish. Meanwhile, pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) beta and follicle-stimulating hormone beta mRNAs were also inhibited (∼80%), but only at 60 min postinjection. Nesfatin-1 administration also resulted in a significant reduction (∼60%) in serum LH levels at 60 min postadministration. Nesfatin-1-like immunoreactivity was also found in the follicle cells, but not the oocytes, in zebrafish and goldfish ovaries. Incubation of zebrafish follicles with nesfatin-1 resulted in a significant reduction in basal germinal vesicle breakdown (∼50%) during the oocyte maturation. In addition, nesfatin-1 also attenuated the stimulatory effects of maturation-inducing hormone on germinal vesicle breakdown. Together, the current results indicate that nesfatin-1 is a metabolic hormone with an inhibitory tone on fish reproduction. Nesfatin-1 appears to elicit this suppressive effect through actions on all three tissues in the fish HPO axis.","PMID":22895855,"authors":[{"lastName":"Gonzalez","initials":"R","foreName":"Ronald"},{"lastName":"Shepperd","initials":"E","foreName":"Erin"},{"lastName":"Thiruppugazh","initials":"V","foreName":"Vetri"},{"lastName":"Lohan","initials":"S","foreName":"Sneha"},{"lastName":"Grey","initials":"CL","foreName":"Caleb L"},{"lastName":"Chang","initials":"JP","foreName":"John P"},{"lastName":"Unniappan","initials":"S","foreName":"Suraj"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15671,"articleTitle":"Microwave assisted synthesis of amorphous magnesium phosphate nanospheres.","dateCreated":"2012-11-27","dateRevised":"2017-10-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1573-4838","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of materials science.

Significant increases in ALP activity and osteocalcin production on day 7 and 14 and calcium deposition on day 21 (P < 0.05) were observed for HA-deposited nanotubular Ti surface when compared with untreated nanotube layer and bare Ti. However, the cell proliferation rate on HA-deposited nanotube surfaces was slowed down significantly (P < 0.05). All these results indicated that this HA-deposited nanotube surface might have the potential benefit to enhance implant osseointegration. The synthetic HA TiO(2) nanotube loading might be a highly promising path to improve the bioactivity of Ti-based implants.","PMID":22847998,"authors":[{"lastName":"Gu","initials":"YX","foreName":"Ying-Xin"},{"lastName":"Du","initials":"J","foreName":"Juan"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"JM","foreName":"Jing-Mei"},{"lastName":"Si","initials":"MS","foreName":"Mi-Si"},{"lastName":"Mo","initials":"JJ","foreName":"Jia-Ji"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"HC","foreName":"Hong-Chang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15552,"articleTitle":"Menstrual disorders.","dateCreated":"2012-07-31","dateRevised":"2012-07-31","publication":{"issnNumber":"1662-2979","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Endocrine development","isoAbbreviation":"Endocr Dev"},"articleDate":"2012-07-25","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Menstrual disorders are very common in adolescence, and can be the cause of a significant amount of stress to both the patients and their parents. Variations of the menstrual cycle in this age are very broad and are mainly caused by the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Amenorrhea (either primary or secondary), abnormal uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhea are conditions that require careful evaluation through a stepwise and logical manner. The term primary amenorrhea refers to the condition when menarche fails to occur, while secondary amenorrhea refers to the cessation of menses once they have begun. The occurrence of irregular, prolonged or heavy abnormal uterine bleeding is one of the most urgent gynecological problems in adolescence and the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding should be used only when all other organic and structural causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding have been ruled out. Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation and is the most common reason for which a young girl may refer to a gynecologist. It is characterized as primary in the absence of an underlying organic disease, and as secondary when there is evidence of pelvic pathology. Appropriate and early management of the patient is necessary in order to minimize the possibility of future complications regarding woman's reproductive ability.","PMID":22846527,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deligeoroglou","initials":"E","foreName":"Efthimios"},{"lastName":"Creatsas","initials":"G","foreName":"George"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15551,"articleTitle":"Selective extraction and determination of vitamin B12 in urine by ionic liquid-based aqueous two-phase system prior to high-performance liquid chromatography.","dateCreated":"2012-07-30","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3573","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Talanta","isoAbbreviation":"Talanta"},"articleDate":"2012-05-15","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A rapid and simple extraction technique based on aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) was developed for separation and enrichment of vitamin B(12) in urine samples.

Yki controls tissue growth by modulating activity of transcription factors including Scalloped (Sd). To date, five SWH pathway kinases have been identified, but large-scale phosphoproteome studies suggest that unidentified SWH pathway kinases exist. To identify such kinases, we performed an RNA interference screen and isolated homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk). Unlike previously identified SWH pathway kinases, Hipk is unique in its ability to promote, rather than repress, Yki activity and does so in parallel to the Yki-repressive kinase, Warts (Wts). Hipk is required for basal Yki activity and is likely to regulate Yki function by promoting its accumulation in the nucleus. Like many SWH pathway proteins, Hipk's function is evolutionarily conserved as its closest human homolog, HIPK2, promotes activity of the Yki ortholog YAP in a kinase-dependent fashion. Further, HIPK2 promotes YAP abundance, suggesting that the mechanism by which HIPK2 regulates YAP has diverged in mammals.","PMID":22840515,"authors":[{"lastName":"Poon","initials":"CL","foreName":"Carole L C"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaomeng"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"JI","foreName":"Jane I"},{"lastName":"Manning","initials":"SA","foreName":"Samuel A"},{"lastName":"Harvey","initials":"KF","foreName":"Kieran F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15548,"articleTitle":"Pubertal development among girls with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia initiated on treatment at different ages.","dateCreated":"2012-07-27","dateRevised":"2013-05-30","publication":{"issnNumber":"2230-9500","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism","isoAbbreviation":"Indian J Endocrinol Metab"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) provide us an opportunity to study the clinical effects of androgen excess in humans.

Central to the mammalian Hippo pathway is the action of the transcriptional regulators TAZ (also known as WWTR1) and YAP, which are controlled by a kinase cascade that is sensitive to mechanosensory and cell polarity cues.We review recent studies focused on the Hippo pathway in embryonic and somatic stem cell renewal and differentiation.Accurate control of TAZ and YAP is crucial for the self-renewal of stem cells and in guiding distinct cell fate decisions. In vivo studies have implicated YAP as a key regulator of tissue-specific progenitor cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Misappropriate activation of nuclear TAZ and YAP transcriptional activity drives tissue overgrowth and is implicated in cancer stem cell-like properties that promote tumor initiation.Understanding the activity and regulation of Hippo pathway effectors will offer insight into human pathologies that evolve from the deregulation of stem cell populations. Given the roles of the Hippo pathway in directing cell fate and tissue regeneration, the discernment of Hippo pathway regulatory cues will be essential for the advancement of regenerative medicine.

It was thought that NED, a chromophoric ion, may form hydrogen bonding pairs with the analytes to cause significant changes in separation selectivity. Additionally, the hydrophobic interactions between analytes and the probe also play a crucial role in achieving a resolution between the two analytes. The analyses were carried out with a background electrolyte composed of 66% MeOH-ACN (1:1, v/v), 34% aqueous buffer containing 15 mM NaH\u2082PO\u2084, 2.5 mM NED, 4 mM H\u2083PO\u2084.

Negatively charged nanosolid, α-Zr(HPO(4))(2)·H(2)O (abbreviated as α-ZrP) and two negatively charged proteins, glucose oxidase (GO) and methemoglobin (Hb), have been chosen as model systems. A limited number of the aspartate and glutamate side chains of these proteins are covalently modified with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) to convert these negatively charged proteins into the corresponding positively charged ones (cationized). Cationized proteins retained their structure and activities to a significant extent, and the influence of cationization on binding affinities has been tested. Cationized GO, for example, showed 250-fold increase in affinity for the negatively charged α-ZrP, when compared to that of the unmodified GO, and cationized Hb, similarly, indicated 26-fold increase in affinity. Circular dichroism spectra showed that α-ZrP-bound cationized GO retained native-like structure to a significant extent, and activity studies showed that cationized GO/α-ZrP complex is ~2.5-fold more active than GO/α-ZrP. Cationized Hb/α-ZrP retained ~75% of activity of Hb/α-ZrP. Therefore, enzyme cationization enhanced affinities by 1-2 orders of magnitude, while retaining considerable activity for the bound biocatalyst. This benign, chemical control over enzyme charge provided a powerful new strategy to rationally modulate enzyme-solid interactions while retaining their biocatalytic properties.","PMID":22816873,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chowdhury","initials":"R","foreName":"Ruma"},{"lastName":"Stromer","initials":"B","foreName":"Bobbi"},{"lastName":"Pokharel","initials":"B","foreName":"Binod"},{"lastName":"Kumar","initials":"CV","foreName":"Challa V"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15540,"articleTitle":"Antiatherosclerotic Effect of Canarium odontophyllum Miq.

Often, much of this anxiety can be alleviated with proper anticipatory guidance about menarche and early menstrual bleeding patterns. Eliciting a menstrual history from an adolescent girl is challenging, and the use of concrete methods to chart their patterns and flow, such as menstrual calendars and pictorial bleeding assessment calendar (PBAC) tools, may be helpful. The importance of obtaining a confidential history from the adolescent girl cannot be overestimated. A confidential sexual history is essential so that pregnancy and infectious causes of bleeding are addressed. Not all menstrual bleeding in young girls is attributable to immaturity of the HPO axis. Anovulation and DUB from other clinically relevant conditions in adolescent girls must also be considered. Chief among these is PCOS, which should always be ruled out when a girl presents with excessive bleeding associated with clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, obesity, or insulin resistance. Attention must also be paid to signs or a family history of a bleeding disorder, as vWD is commonly associated with excessive uterine bleeding. Importantly, the laboratory testing for both PCOS and vWD is affected by therapies for the excessive bleeding, and it should be performed before hormonal interventions or blood products are administered or during the placebo phase if treatment has begun. Management goals for excessive uterine bleeding include stabilizing the endometrium and stopping further blood loss, as well as preventing future uncontrolled blood loss. Hormonal stabilization of the endometrium is often helpful regardless of the cause of bleeding and especially in those with hormonally mediated anovulation. New antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, may also be helpful in the emergent setting and in adolescents with bleeding disorders.","PMID":22764555,"authors":[{"lastName":"Talib","initials":"HJ","foreName":"Hina J"},{"lastName":"Coupey","initials":"SM","foreName":"Susan M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15541,"articleTitle":"Formation of \"fuzzy\" phases with high proton conductivities in the composites of polyphosphoric acid and metal oxide nanoparticles.","dateCreated":"2012-07-20","dateRevised":"2012-07-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1463-9084","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP","isoAbbreviation":"Phys Chem Chem Phys"},"articleDate":"2012-07-05","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A high proton-conducting phase appears in the composites of zirconium- and titanium-oxide nanoparticles and polyphosphoric acid (HPO(3)).

The newly predicted phenotypes in each disease class are highly consistent with human phenotype ontology annotations.

As cells lacking Hippo signaling are similar in size compared to normal cells, cellular growth must be properly maintained in Hippo signaling-deficient cells. However, it is not clear how Hippo signaling might regulate cellular growth. Here we show that loss of Hippo signaling increased Akt (also called Protein Kinase B, PKB) expression and activity, whereas activation of Hippo signaling reduced Akt expression in developing tissues in Drosophila. While yorkie (yki) is sufficient to increase Akt expression, Akt up-regulation caused by the loss of Hippo signaling is strongly dependent on yki, indicating that Hippo signaling negatively regulates Akt expression through Yki inhibition. Consistently, genetic analysis revealed that Akt plays a critical role in facilitating growth of Hippo signaling-defective tissues. Thus, Hippo signaling not only blocks cell division and promotes apoptosis, but also regulates cellular growth by inhibiting the Akt pathway activity.","PMID":22732571,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ye","initials":"X","foreName":"Xin"},{"lastName":"Deng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yaoting"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"ZC","foreName":"Zhi-Chun"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15539,"articleTitle":"Theoretical insights into the mechanism of carbon monoxide (CO) release from CO-releasing molecules.","dateCreated":"2012-07-18","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1521-3765","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)","isoAbbreviation":"Chemistry"},"articleDate":"2012-06-22","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We used density functional theory to investigate the capacity for carbon monoxide (CO) release of five newly synthesized manganese-containing CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), namely CORM-368 (1), CORM-401 (2), CORM-371 (3), CORM-409 (4), and CORM-313 (5).

In this manuscript, we present a method for disease gene prioritization based on comparing phenotypes of mouse models with those of human diseases. For this purpose, either human disease phenotypes are \"translated\" into a mouse-based representation (using the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology), or mouse phenotypes are \"translated\" into a human-based representation (using the Human Phenotype Ontology). We apply a measure of semantic similarity and rank experimentally identified phenotypes in mice with respect to their phenotypic similarity to human diseases. Our method is evaluated on manually curated and experimentally verified gene-disease associations for human and for mouse. We evaluate our approach using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and obtain an area under the ROC curve of up to .

In humans, mutation of the Patched1 (PTCH1) gene, which encodes an inhibitor of Hh signaling, leads to tumors of the skin and pediatric brain. Despite the high level of conservation between the vertebrate and invertebrate Hh pathways, studies in Drosophila have yet to find direct evidence that ptc limits organ size. Here we report identification of Drosophila ptc in a screen for mutations that require a synergistic apoptotic block in order to drive overgrowth. Developing imaginal discs containing clones of ptc mutant cells immortalized by the concurrent loss of the Apaf-1-related killer (Ark) gene are overgrown due, in large part, to the overgrowth of wild type portions of these discs. This phenotype correlates with overexpression of the morphogen Dpp in ptc,Ark double-mutant cells, leading to elevated phosphorylation of the Dpp pathway effector Mad (p-Mad) in cells surrounding ptc,Ark mutant clones. p-Mad functions with the Hippo pathway oncoprotein Yorkie (Yki) to induce expression of the pro-growth/anti-apoptotic microRNA bantam. Accordingly, Yki activity is elevated among wild type cells surrounding ptc,Ark clones and alleles of bantam and yki dominantly suppress the enlarged-disc phenotype produced by loss of ptc. These data suggest that ptc can regulate Yki in a non-cell autonomous manner and reveal an intercellular link between the Hh and Hippo pathways that may contribute to growth-regulatory properties of the Hh pathway in development and disease.","PMID":22705500,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kagey","initials":"JD","foreName":"Jacob D"},{"lastName":"Brown","initials":"JA","foreName":"Jordan A"},{"lastName":"Moberg","initials":"KH","foreName":"Kenneth H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15583,"articleTitle":"Setting solution concentration effect on properties of a TTCP/DCPA-derived calcium phosphate cement.","dateCreated":"2012-08-31","dateRevised":"2017-10-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1573-4838","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of materials science.

In mosaic Drosophila imaginal discs, for example, wild-type cells induce the elimination of adjacent slow-growing Minute cells by apoptosis, while, conversely, certain types of faster-growing cells are able to eliminate adjacent wild-type cells. This process, known as cell competition, represents one example of a diverse group of phenomena in which short-range heterotypic interactions result in the selective elimination of one type of cell by another. The mechanisms that designate \"winner\" and \"loser\" genotypes in these processes are not known. Here we show that apoptosis is observed preferentially at boundaries that separate populations of cells that express different levels of the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb). Cells that express higher levels of Crb tend to be eliminated when they are near cells that express lower levels of Crb. We also observe distortions in the structure of epithelia on either side of boundaries between populations of cells that differ in Crb expression. Thus, while previous studies have focused mostly on the cell autonomous functions of Crb, we show that Crb can regulate cell survival and tissue morphology nonautonomously. Moreover, we find that the extracellular domain (ECD) of Crb, which seems to be dispensable for some of the other characterised functions of Crb, is required to elicit the nonautonomous effects on cell survival. The ECD can also regulate the subcellular localisation of Hippo pathway components, and possibly other proteins, in adjacent cells and may therefore directly mediate these effects. Several genetic lesions alter Crb levels, including loss-of-function mutations in hyperplastic tumour suppressors in the Hippo-Salvador-Warts pathway and in neoplastic tumour suppressor genes, such as scribble. Thus, Crb may be part of a \"surveillance mechanism\" that is responsible for the cell death that is observed at the boundaries of mutant clones in these cases.","PMID":22683826,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hafezi","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yassi"},{"lastName":"Bosch","initials":"JA","foreName":"Justin A"},{"lastName":"Hariharan","initials":"IK","foreName":"Iswar K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15534,"articleTitle":"Visible-light photocatalytic activity and deactivation mechanism of Ag3PO4 spherical particles.","dateCreated":"2012-07-13","dateRevised":"2012-07-13","publication":{"issnNumber":"1861-471X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemistry, an Asian journal","isoAbbreviation":"Chem Asian J"},"articleDate":"2012-06-08","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Ag(3)PO(4) spherical particles were synthesized by a facile precipitation method using silver nitrate and Na(2) HPO(4) as precursors.

One example is cytochrome c oxidase (COX) with its important function for energy metabolism in the mitochondria. The phosphorylation of this enzyme is a prerequisite for the allosteric ATP-inhibition and therefore necessary to adapt energy production to ATP demand of the cell. Its hydrophobic nature hampers the recognition of phosphorylated amino acids in most subunits of this complex, and as a consequence, only a few phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry. We describe here a method that enables the analysis of integral membrane proteins by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide (BrCN), a method that improves the mass spectrometric detection of hydrophobic proteins. The low abundance of phosphopeptides requires efficient enrichment techniques, such as TiO(2)-based methods. However, this strategy failed in our hands when just BrCN-cleaved peptides were used. Only an additional size-reduction with trypsin produced peptides with optimal properties for enrichment and MS-identification. Another bottleneck was the correct assignment of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine because peptide-ion fragmentation by collision induced dissociation (CID) often results in neutral loss of HPO(3) or H(2)PO(4) from the precursor, decreasing fragmentations that define the peptide sequence and the phosphorylation site. The additional usage of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) as an alternative fragmentation method enabled the precise assignment of the phosphorylated amino acids. In a total of six, new phosphorylation sites of four COX-subunits were identified by this strategy.","PMID":22665310,"authors":[{"lastName":"Helling","initials":"S","foreName":"Stefan"},{"lastName":"Hüttemann","initials":"M","foreName":"Maik"},{"lastName":"Kadenbach","initials":"B","foreName":"Bernhard"},{"lastName":"Ramzan","initials":"R","foreName":"Rabia"},{"lastName":"Vogt","initials":"S","foreName":"Sebastian"},{"lastName":"Marcus","initials":"K","foreName":"Katrin"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15517,"articleTitle":"The Hippo signaling pathway and stem cell biology.","dateCreated":"2012-06-26","dateRevised":"2016-10-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-3088","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Trends in cell biology","isoAbbreviation":"Trends Cell Biol."},"articleDate":"2012-05-31","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Stem cell (SC) activity fluctuates throughout an organism's lifetime to maintain homeostatic conditions in all tissues.

All monovalent counterions bind less strongly to the micelle surface than does bromide or chloride, whereas multivalent species bind more strongly. Small-angle neutron scattering reveals that, unlike alkyltrimethylammonium bromides and chlorides, micelles are small and spherical in the presence of hydrolyzable counterions of all valences and remain spherical even in the presence of added electrolyte. This is consistent with the strong solvation of even strongly bound hydrolyzable counterions, which prevents the screening of repulsions between adjacent headgroups necessary for sphere-cylinder transformations.

The I172A and L232A mutations result in 100- and 6-fold decreases in k(cat)/K(m) for the isomerization reaction, respectively. The effect of the mutations on the product distributions for the catalyzed reactions of GAP and of [1-(13)C]-glycolaldehyde ([1-(13)C]-GA) in D(2)O is reported. The 40% yield of DHAP from wild-type Tbb TIM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP with intramolecular transfer of hydrogen is found to decrease to 13% and to 4%, respectively, for the reactions catalyzed by the I172A and L232A mutants. Likewise, the 13% yield of [2-(13)C]-GA from isomerization of [1-(13)C]-GA in D(2)O is found to decrease to 2% and to 1%, respectively, for the reactions catalyzed by the I172A and L232A mutants. The decrease in the yield of the product of intramolecular transfer of hydrogen is consistent with a repositioning of groups at the active site that favors transfer of the substrate-derived hydrogen to the protein or the oxygen anion of the bound intermediate. The I172A and L232A mutations result in (a) a >10-fold decrease (I172A) and a 17-fold increase (L232A) in the second-order rate constant for the TIM-catalyzed reaction of [1-(13)C]-GA in D(2)O, (b) a 170-fold decrease (I172A) and 25-fold increase (L232A) in the third-order rate constant for phosphite dianion (HPO(3)(2-)) activation of the TIM-catalyzed reaction of GA in D(2)O, and (c) a 1.5-fold decrease (I172A) and a larger 16-fold decrease (L232A) in K(d) for activation of TIM by HPO(3)(2-) in D(2)O. The effects of the I172A mutation on the kinetic parameters for the wild-type TIM-catalyzed reactions of the whole substrate and substrate pieces are consistent with a decrease in the basicity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-167 for the mutant enzyme.

The geometry of solid bis-chelated complexes [VOL(2)], with L = hpo and mpo, is square pyramidal, but it can change to cis-[VOL(2)S], where S is a solvent molecule, when these are dissolved in a coordinating solvent. The equilibrium between the square pyramidal and cis-octahedral forms is strongly affected by solvent and temperature. At room temperature, the predominant species is [VOL(2)], which gives a pink colour to the solutions; at lower temperatures, the equilibrium is shifted--partially or completely--toward the formation of cis-[VOL(2)S], which is green. In an acidic environment and in the presence of an excess of ligand, [VOL(2)] can transform into the tris-chelated complex [VL(3)](+), in which vanadium loses the oxido ligand and adopts a hexa-coordinated geometry intermediate between octahedral and trigonal prismatic. 1-Methylimidazole (1-MeIm), which represents a model for His-N coordination, forms mixed complexes with stoichiometry cis-[VOL(2)(1-MeIm)], occupying an equatorial position.

Downregulation of Hippo signalling leads to tissue overgrowths due to Yki-mediated activation of target genes, whereas overexpression of the pathway triggers apoptosis in developing tissues.

We found that overexpression of Hpo leads to induction of Dronc (Drosophila Caspase-9 homologue) expression and downregulation of dronc can suppress/block Hpo-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, upregulation of Dronc activity strongly suppressed the overgrowth caused by Yki overexpression thereby suggesting that Hippo signalling restricts Dronc activity. Hippo-mediated cell death requires the activity of the initiator caspase Dronc. Loss-of-function of dronc in genetic mosaics leads to cell survival and increased cell proliferation in imaginal discs. dronc is transcriptionally suppressed in Yki overexpressing cells or cells mutant for other Hippo pathway components like warts (wts).

In the present investigation, the CAACO treated tannery wastewater was applied to Synechocystis sp. inoculated algal batch reactor of hydraulic residence time 24 h. The BOD(5), COD, and TOC of treated wastewater from algal batch reactor were 20 ± 7, 167 ± 29, and 78 ± 16 mg/l respectively. The integrated CAACO system and Algal batch reactor was operated for 30 days and they accomplished a cumulative removal of BOD(5),COD, TOC, VFA and sulphide as 98 %, 95 %, 93 %, 86 %, and 100 %, respectively. The biokinetic constants for the growth of algae in the batch reactor were specific growth rate, 0.095(day(-1)) and yield coefficient, 3.15 mg of algal biomass/mg of COD destructed. The degradation of xenobiotic compounds in the algal batch reactor was confirmed through HPLC and FT-IR techniques. The integrated CAACO-Algal reactor system established a credible reduction in pollution parameters in the tannery wastewater. The removal mechanism is mainly due to co-metabolism between algae and bacterial species and the organics were completely metabolized rather than by adsorption.","PMID":22528997,"authors":[{"lastName":"Sekaran","initials":"G","foreName":"G"},{"lastName":"Karthikeyan","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Nagalakshmi","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Mandal","initials":"AB","foreName":"A B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15453,"articleTitle":"Enhancing separation of histidine from amino acids via free-flow affinity electrophoresis with gravity-induced uniform hydrodynamic flow.","dateCreated":"2012-04-23","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1522-2683","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Electrophoresis","isoAbbreviation":"Electrophoresis"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In this paper, a novel mode of free-flow affinity electrophoresis (FFAE) was developed to indirectly enhance the separation of free-flow electrophoresis (FFE). In the mode of FFAE, a Ni(II) with high electric charge density and histidine (His) is chosen as a model ligand and target solute, respectively. Through the controlling of experimental conditions (10 mM pH 6.0 Na(2)HPO(4)-NaH(2)PO(4) with 2.0 mM NiCl(2)·6H(2)O background buffer), Ni(II) can combine with His and the combination leads to the high electric charge density of affinity complex of His-Ni(II) in contrast to the low density of free His molecule. But the ligand has weak interaction with uninterested amino acids. Thus, the mobility of His existing as His-Ni(II) is greatly increased from 14.5×10(-8) m(2) V(-1) s(-1) to 30.2 × 10(-8) m(2) V(-1) s(-1), while those mobilities of uninterested amino acids are almost constant. By virtue of the mode, we developed the FFAE procedure and conducted the relevant experiments. The experiments demonstrated the following merits of the FFAE technique: (i) clear enhancement of separation between the target solute of His and uninterested amino acids; (ii) simplicity, and (iii) low cost. Furthermore, the technique was used for the continuous separation of His from its complex sample, and the purity of His was near to 100%. All of the results demonstrate the feasibility of affinity separation in FFE. The developed FFAE may be used in the separation and pretreatment of some biological molecules (e.g. peptides).","PMID":22522540,"authors":[{"lastName":"Pang","initials":"B","foreName":"Bo"},{"lastName":"Shao","initials":"J","foreName":"Jing"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jie"},{"lastName":"Geng","initials":"JZ","foreName":"Jia-Zhen"},{"lastName":"Fan","initials":"LY","foreName":"Liu-Yin"},{"lastName":"Cao","initials":"CX","foreName":"Cheng-Xi"},{"lastName":"Hou","initials":"JL","foreName":"Jing-Li"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15467,"articleTitle":"Uranyl heteropolyoxometalate: synthesis, structure, and spectroscopic properties.","dateCreated":"2012-05-07","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-510X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2012-04-20","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A novel uranium heteropolyoxometalate, [H(3)O](4)[Ni(H(2)O)(3)](4){Ni[(UO(2))(PO(3)C(6)H(4)CO(2))](3)(PO(4)H)}(4)·2.72H(2)O, has been prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions using the diethyl(2-ethoxycarbonylphenyl)phosphonate ligand and in situ ligand synthesis of the HPO(4)(2-) anion.

However, this approach is not attractive for clinical use owing to increased patient dose. The authors propose a novel energy mapping approach referred to as virtual DECT (VDECT) taking advantage of the DECT formulation but using CT data acquired at a single energy (kV(P)). For this purpose, the CT image acquired at one energy is used to generate the CT image at a second energy using calculated kV(P) conversion curves derived from phantom studies.The attenuation map (μ-map) at 511 keV was generated for the XCAT phantom and clinical studies using the bilinear, DECT, and VDECT techniques. The generated μ-maps at 511 keV are compared to the reference derived from the XCAT phantom serving as ground truth. PET data generated from a predefined activity map for the XCAT phantom were then corrected for attenuation using μ-maps generated using the different energy mapping approaches. In addition, the generated μ-maps using the above described methods for a cylindrical polyethylene phantom containing different concentrations of K(2)HPO(4) in water were compared to actual attenuation coefficients. Likewise, CT images of five clinical whole-body studies were used to generate μ-maps using the various energy-mapping approaches were compared with μ-maps acquired at 511 keV using (68)Ge/(68)Ga rod sources for the clinical studies.The results of phantom studies demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate than the bilinear technique. All three μ-maps yielded almost similar results for soft and lung tissues whereas for bone tissues, the DECT and the VDECT methods produced a much smaller mean relative difference (3.0% and 2.8%, respectively) than the bilinear approach (11.8%). Likewise, the comparison of PET images corrected for attenuation using the various methods showed that the proposed method provides better accuracy (6.5%) than the bilinear method (13.4%). Clinical studies further demonstrated that, compared to the bilinear method, the VDECT approach has better agreement for bony structures with the DECT technique (1.5% versus 8.9%) and transmission scanning (8.8% versus 17.7%).It was concluded that the proposed method outperforms the bilinear method especially in bony structures. Further evaluation using a large clinical PET/CT database is underway to evaluate the potential of the technique in a clinical setting.","PMID":22482629,"authors":[{"lastName":"Teimourian","initials":"B","foreName":"B"},{"lastName":"Ay","initials":"MR","foreName":"M R"},{"lastName":"Zafarghandi","initials":"MS","foreName":"M Shamsaie"},{"lastName":"Ghafarian","initials":"P","foreName":"P"},{"lastName":"Ghadiri","initials":"H","foreName":"H"},{"lastName":"Zaidi","initials":"H","foreName":"H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15481,"articleTitle":"Rapid HILIC method with fluorescence detection using derivatization reaction utilizing o-phthaldialdehyde for determination of degradation product of aliskiren.","dateCreated":"2012-05-21","dateRevised":"2012-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-264X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis","isoAbbreviation":"J Pharm Biomed Anal"},"articleDate":"2012-03-17","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A rapid procedure based on direct extraction and HILIC separation of aliskiren (ALI) degradation product - 3-amino-2,2-dimethylpropanamide (ADPA) with fluorescence detection has been developed.

The key oncoprotein of the SWH pathway is the transcriptional co-activator, Yes-associated protein (YAP). YAP promotes tissue growth and transformation of cultured cells by interacting with transcriptional regulatory proteins via its WW domains, or, in the case of the TEAD1-4 transcription factors, an N-terminal binding domain. YAP possesses a putative transactivation domain in its C-terminus that is necessary to stimulate transcription factors in vitro, but its requirement for YAP function has not been investigated in detail. Interestingly, whilst the WW domains and TEAD-binding domain are highly conserved in the Drosophila melanogaster YAP orthologue, Yorkie, the majority of the C-terminal region of YAP is not present in Yorkie. To investigate this apparent conundrum, we assessed the functional roles of the YAP and Yorkie C-termini. We found that these regions were not required for Yorkie's ability to drive tissue growth in vivo, or YAP's ability to promote anchorage-independent growth or resistance to contact inhibition. However, the YAP transactivation domain was required for YAP's ability to induce cell migration and invasion. Moreover, a role for the YAP transactivation domain in cell transformation was uncovered when the YAP WW domains were mutated together with the transactivation domain. This shows that YAP can promote cell transformation in a flexible manner, presumably by contacting transcriptional regulatory proteins either via its WW domains or its transactivation domain.","PMID":22359650,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaomeng"},{"lastName":"Grusche","initials":"FA","foreName":"Felix A"},{"lastName":"Harvey","initials":"KF","foreName":"Kieran F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15392,"articleTitle":"Struvite precipitation for ammonia nitrogen removal in 7-aminocephalosporanic acid wastewater.","dateCreated":"2012-02-22","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1420-3049","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","isoAbbreviation":"Molecules"},"articleDate":"2012-02-21","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"7-Aminocephalosporanic acid wastewater usually contains high concentrations of ammonium (NH\u2084\u207a-N), which is known to inhibit nitrification during biological treatment processes.

Thus, the results of the B3LYP BOMD simulations do not only characterize physical properties like the IR spectra or the solvation structures of the phosphate systems but also provide clues for the future design of simplified but nevertheless reasonably accurate DFT/MM methods applicable to phosphates.","PMID":22352866,"authors":[{"lastName":"VandeVondele","initials":"J","foreName":"Joost"},{"lastName":"Tröster","initials":"P","foreName":"Philipp"},{"lastName":"Tavan","initials":"P","foreName":"Paul"},{"lastName":"Mathias","initials":"G","foreName":"Gerald"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15421,"articleTitle":"Embedding 'speaking up' into systems for safe healthcare product development and marketing surveillance.","dateCreated":"2012-03-22","dateRevised":"2016-09-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"1179-1942","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Drug safety","isoAbbreviation":"Drug Saf"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Robust, active cooperation, and effective, open communication between all stakeholders is essential for ensuring regulatory compliance and healthcare product safety; avoiding the necessity for whistle-blowing; and, most essentially, meeting the transparency requirements of public trust.The focus here is on what can be done within a healthcare product organization (HPO) to achieve actionable, sustainable policies and practices such as leadership, management, and supervision role-modelling of best practice; ongoing process review and improvements in every department; protection of those who report concerns through robust policies endorsed at Board level throughout an organization to eliminate the fear of retaliation; training in open, non-defensive team-working principles; and mediation structure and process for resolution of differences of opinion or interpretation of contradictory and volatile data.Based on analyses of other safety systems, workplace silence and interpersonal breakdowns are warning signs of defective systems underlying poor compliance and compromising safety. Remedying the situation requires attention to the root causes underlying such symptoms of dysfunction, especially the human factor, i.e. those factors that influence human performance. It is essential that leadership and management listen to employees' concerns about systems and processes, assess them impartially and reward contributions that improve safety.Fundamentally, the safety, transparency, and trustworthiness of HPOs, both commercial and regulatory, can be judged by the extent of the freedom of their staff to 'speak up' when the time is right. This, in turn, consolidates the trust of external stakeholders in the safety of a system and its products. The promotion of 'speaking up' in an organization provides an important safeguard against the risk of poor compliance and the undermining of societal confidence in the safety of healthcare products.","PMID":22339507,"authors":[{"lastName":"Edwards","initials":"B","foreName":"Brian"},{"lastName":"Hugman","initials":"B","foreName":"Bruce"},{"lastName":"Tobin","initials":"M","foreName":"Mary"},{"lastName":"Whalen","initials":"M","foreName":"Matthew"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15386,"articleTitle":"Separation of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using polymeric surfactants in polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings.","dateCreated":"2012-02-16","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1945-239X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of chromatographic science","isoAbbreviation":"J Chromatogr Sci"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The main objective of this study is the use of polymeric surfactants in polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings for the separation of the pharmaceutical substances acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs).

The inclusion of exogenous phytase in pig and poultry diets degrades phytate to more innocuous esters and attenuates these negative influences. The objective of the present review is to reappraise the underlying mechanisms of these interactions and reassess their implications in pig and poultry nutrition. Protein digestion appears to be impeded by phytate in the following manner. Binary protein-phytate complexes are formed at pH levels less than the isoelectric point of proteins and complexed proteins are refractory to pepsin digestion. Once the protein isoelectric points are exceeded binary complexes dissociate; however, the isoelectric point of proteins in cereal grains may be sufficiently high to permit these complexes to persist in the small intestine. Ternary protein-phytate complexes are formed at pH levels above the isoelectric point of proteins where a cationic bridge links the protein and phytate moieties. The molecular weights of protein and polypeptides in small-intestinal digesta may be sufficient to allow phytate to bind nutritionally important amounts of protein in ternary complexes. Thus binary and ternary complexes may impede protein digestion and amino acid absorption in the small intestine. Alternatively, phytate may interact with protein indirectly. Myo-inositol hexaphosphate possesses six phosphate anionic moieties (HPO(4)(2-)) that have strong kosmotropic effects and can stabilise proteins by interacting with the surrounding water medium. Phytate increases mucin secretions into the gut, which increases endogenous amino acid flows as the protein component of mucin remains largely undigested. Phytate promotes the transition of Na(+) into the small-intestinal lumen and this suggests that phytate may interfere with glucose and amino acid absorption by compromising Na(+)-dependent transport systems and the activity of the Na pump (Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase). Starch digestion may be depressed by phytate interacting with proteins that are closely associated with starch in the endosperm of cereal grains. While elucidation is required, the impacts of dietary phytate and exogenous phytase on the site, rate and synchrony of glucose and amino acid intestinal uptakes may be of importance to efficient protein deposition. Somewhat paradoxically, the responses to phytase in the majority of amino acid digestibility assays in pigs and poultry are equivocal. A brief consideration of the probable reasons for these inconclusive outcomes is included in this reappraisal.","PMID":22309781,"authors":[{"lastName":"Selle","initials":"PH","foreName":"Peter H"},{"lastName":"Cowieson","initials":"AJ","foreName":"Aaron J"},{"lastName":"Cowieson","initials":"NP","foreName":"Nathan P"},{"lastName":"Ravindran","initials":"V","foreName":"V"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15405,"articleTitle":"Calculating phenotypic similarity between genes using hierarchical structure data based on semantic similarity.","dateCreated":"2012-03-06","dateRevised":"2012-03-06","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0038","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Gene","isoAbbreviation":"Gene"},"articleDate":"2012-01-27","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Phenotypic similarity is correlated with a number of measures of gene function, such as relatedness at the level of direct protein-protein interaction.

Furthermore, we assessed the performance of these five measures by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and found that most of them performed better than the previous methods.

The damage-related increase in ISC proliferation requires deactivation of the Hippo pathway and consequential activation of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) in both ECs and ISCs. Here, we identify Pez, an evolutionarily conserved FERM domain protein containing a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, as a novel binding partner of the upstream Hippo signaling component Kibra.

The core pathway consists of the Hpo/Warts (Wts) kinase cassette that phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Here, we report that Echinoid (Ed), an immunoglobulin domain-containing cell adhesion molecule, acts as an upstream regulator of the Hpo pathway. Loss of Ed compromises Yki phosphorylation, resulting in elevated Yki activity that increases Hpo target gene expression and drives tissue overgrowth. Ed physically interacts with and stabilizes the Hpo-binding partner Salvador (Sav) at adherens junctions. Ed/Sav interaction is promoted by cell-cell contact and requires dimerization of Ed cytoplasmic domain. Overexpression of Sav or dimerized Ed cytoplasmic domain suppressed loss-of-Ed phenotypes. We propose that Ed may link cell-cell contact to Hpo signaling through binding and stabilizing Sav, thus modulating the Hpo kinase activity.","PMID":22280890,"authors":[{"lastName":"Yue","initials":"T","foreName":"Tao"},{"lastName":"Tian","initials":"A","foreName":"Aiguo"},{"lastName":"Jiang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jin"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15440,"articleTitle":"A synthetic hexapeptide designed to resemble a proteinaceous P-loop nest is shown to bind inorganic phosphate.","dateCreated":"2012-04-10","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1097-0134","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Proteins","isoAbbreviation":"Proteins"},"articleDate":"2012-03-01","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The hexapeptide Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Lys-Thr has been synthesized and characterized. It was designed as a minimal soluble peptide that would be likely to have the phosphate-binding properties observed in the P-loops of proteins that bind the β-phosphate of GTP or ATP. The β-phosphate in such proteins is bound by a combination of the side chain ε-amino group of the lysine residue plus the concavity formed by successive main chain peptide NH groups called a nest, which is favored by the glycines. The hexapeptide is shown to bind HPO(4) (2-) strongly at neutral pH. The affinities of the various ionized species of phosphate and hexapeptide are analyzed, showing that they increase with pH. It is likely the main chain NH groups of the hexapeptide bind phosphate in much the same way as the corresponding P-loop atoms bind the phosphate ligand in proteins. Most proteinaceous P-loops are situated at the N-termini of α-helices, and this observation has frequently been considered a key aspect of these binding sites. Such a hexapeptide in isolation seems unlikely to form an α-helix, an expectation in accord with the CD spectra examined; this suggests that being at the N-terminus of an α-helix is not essential for phosphate binding. An unexpected finding about the hexapeptide-HPO(4) (2-) complex is that the side chain ε-amino group of the lysine occurs in its deprotonated form, which appears to bind HPO(4) (2-) via an N···H-O-P hydrogen bond.","PMID":22275093,"authors":[{"lastName":"Bianchi","initials":"A","foreName":"Antonio"},{"lastName":"Giorgi","initials":"C","foreName":"Claudia"},{"lastName":"Ruzza","initials":"P","foreName":"Paolo"},{"lastName":"Toniolo","initials":"C","foreName":"Claudio"},{"lastName":"Milner-White","initials":"EJ","foreName":"E James"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15364,"articleTitle":"Distributed Bragg reflector based on porous anodic alumina fabricated by pulse anodization.","dateCreated":"2012-01-25","dateRevised":"2012-01-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1361-6528","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nanotechnology","isoAbbreviation":"Nanotechnology"},"articleDate":"2012-01-24","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) based on nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) formed by pulse anodization.

Since initial studies in Drosophila melanogaster were instrumental in defining Hippo signalling, the machinery was named after the central Ste20-like kinase Hippo. Moreover, given that loss of Hippo signalling components Hippo, Warts, and Mats resulted in uncontrolled tissue overgrowth, Hippo signalling was defined as a tumour-suppressor cascade. Significantly, all of the core factors of Hippo signalling have mammalian orthologues that functionally compensate for loss of their counterparts in Drosophila. Furthermore, studies in Drosophila and mammalian cell systems showed that Hippo signalling represents a kinase cascade that is tightly regulated by PPIs (protein-protein interactions). Several Hippo signalling molecules contain SARAH (Salvador/RASSF1A/Hippo) domains that mediate specific PPIs, thereby influencing the activities of MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase 1/2) kinases, the human Hippo orthologues. Moreover, WW domains are present in several Hippo factors, and these domains also serve as interaction surfaces for regulatory PPIs in Hippo signalling. Finally, the kinase activities of LATS1/2 (large tumour-suppressor kinase 1/2), the human counterparts of Warts, are controlled by binding to hMOB1 (human Mps one binder protein 1), the human Mats. Therefore Hippo signalling is regulated by PPIs on several levels. In the present paper, I review the current understanding of how these regulatory PPIs are regulated and contribute to the functionality of Hippo signalling.","PMID":22260677,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hergovich","initials":"A","foreName":"Alexander"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15385,"articleTitle":"Formation of octacalcium phosphates with co-incorporated succinate and suberate ions.","dateCreated":"2012-02-15","dateRevised":"2012-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"1477-9234","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)","isoAbbreviation":"Dalton Trans"},"articleDate":"2012-01-16","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Octacalcium phosphates (OCPs) co-incorporated with various molar ratios of succinate and suberate ions were synthesized by wet processing.

Although the Hpo function is conserved, little is known about the mechanism of how its kinase activity is regulated. Based on structural information, we performed mutation-function analysis and provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that Hpo activation requires proper dimerization of its N-terminal kinase domain as well as the C-terminal SARAH domain. Hpo carrying point mutation M242E can still dimerize, yet the dimers formed between intermolecular kinase domains were altered in conformation. As a result, autophosphorylation of Hpo at Thr-195 was blocked, and its kinase activity was abolished. In contrast, Hpo carrying I634D, a single mutation introduced in the Hpo C-terminal SARAH domain, disrupted the dimerization of the SARAH domain, leading to reduced Hippo activity. We also find that the Hpo C-terminal half contains two nuclear export signals that promote cytoplasmic localization and activity of Hpo. Taken together, our results suggest that dimerization and nucleocytoplasmic translocation of Hpo are crucial for its biological function and indicate that a proper dimer conformation of the kinase domain is essential for Hpo autophosphorylation and kinase activity.","PMID":22215676,"authors":[{"lastName":"Jin","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yunyun"},{"lastName":"Dong","initials":"L","foreName":"Liang"},{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yi"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"W","foreName":"Wenqing"},{"lastName":"Hao","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qian"},{"lastName":"Zhou","initials":"Z","foreName":"Zhaocai"},{"lastName":"Jiang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jin"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yun"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"L","foreName":"Lei"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15386,"articleTitle":"The roles of cell size and cell number in determining ovariole number in Drosophila.","dateCreated":"2012-02-16","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1095-564X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Developmental biology","isoAbbreviation":"Dev.

The number of ovarioles varies between and within species. Ovariole number is an important determinant of fecundity and thus affects individual fitness. Although Drosophila oogenesis has been intensively studied, the genetic and cellular basis for determination of ovariole number remains unknown. Ovariole formation begins during larval development with the morphogenesis of terminal filament cells (TFCs) into stacks called terminal filaments (TFs). We induced changes in ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster by genetically altering cell size and cell number in the TFC population, and analyzed TF morphogenesis in these ovaries to understand the cellular basis for the changes in ovariole number. Increasing TFC size contributed to higher ovariole number by increasing TF number. Similarly, increasing total TFC number led to higher ovariole number via an increase in TF number. By analyzing ovarian morphogenesis in another Drosophila species we showed that TFC number regulation is a target of evolutionary change that affects ovariole number. In contrast, temperature-dependent plasticity in ovariole number was due to changes in cell-cell sorting during TF morphogenesis, rather than changes in cell size or cell number. We have thus identified two distinct developmental processes that regulate ovariole number: establishment of total TFC number, and TFC sorting during TF morphogenesis. Our data suggest that the genetic changes underlying species-specific ovariole number may alter the total number of TFCs available to contribute to TF formation. This work provides for the first time specific and quantitative developmental tools to investigate the evolution of a highly conserved reproductive structure.","PMID":22200592,"authors":[{"lastName":"Sarikaya","initials":"DP","foreName":"Didem Pelin"},{"lastName":"Belay","initials":"AA","foreName":"Abel A"},{"lastName":"Ahuja","initials":"A","foreName":"Abha"},{"lastName":"Dorta","initials":"A","foreName":"Aisha"},{"lastName":"Green","initials":"DA","foreName":"Delbert André"},{"lastName":"Extavour","initials":"CG","foreName":"Cassandra G"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15350,"articleTitle":"Tumor suppression by cell competition through regulation of the Hippo pathway.","dateCreated":"2012-01-11","dateRevised":"2015-01-29","publication":{"issnNumber":"1091-6490","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","isoAbbreviation":"Proc.

When all cells in imaginal discs are mutant for scrib, they hyperactivate the Hippo pathway effector Yorkie (Yki), which drives growth of the discs into large neoplastic masses. Strikingly, when discs also contain normal cells, the scrib(-) cells do not overproliferate and eventually undergo apoptosis through JNK-dependent mechanisms. However, induction of apoptosis does not explain how scrib(-) cells are prevented from overproliferating. We report that cell competition between scrib(-) and wild-type cells prevents hyperproliferation by suppressing Yki activity in scrib(-) cells. Suppressing Yki activation is critical for scrib(-) clone elimination by cell competition, and experimental elevation of Yki activity in scrib(-) cells is sufficient to fuel their neoplastic growth. Thus, cell competition acts as a tumor-suppressing mechanism by regulating the Hippo pathway in scrib(-) cells.","PMID":22190496,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"CL","foreName":"Chiao-Lin"},{"lastName":"Schroeder","initials":"MC","foreName":"Molly C"},{"lastName":"Kango-Singh","initials":"M","foreName":"Madhuri"},{"lastName":"Tao","initials":"C","foreName":"Chunyao"},{"lastName":"Halder","initials":"G","foreName":"Georg"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15348,"articleTitle":"A novel high-spin tridecanuclear Ni(II) cluster with an azido-bridged core exhibiting disk-like topology.","dateCreated":"2012-01-09","dateRevised":"2012-01-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"1364-548X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)","isoAbbreviation":"Chem.

In this work, the structure of the formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (FDH, EC: 1.2.1.2) in three imidazolium-based ILs (dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate [MMIm][Me(2)PO(4)], 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [BMIm][CH(3)COO], and dimethylimidazolium methylphosphonate [MMIm][CH(3)HPO(2)(OCH(3))]) is studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The UV-vis spectroscopic analysis shows that the decrease of the FDH fluorescence is not only due to the high light absorption of these ILs. The Stern-Volmer analysis clearly shows that these ILs are quenchers of the indole fluorescence, while this quenching property is not found when imidazole is used. Fluorescence spectra of the FDH in the presence of the ILs show that a maximal ionic liquid concentration (MILc), which could be used for steady-state fluorescence study, should be defined. Therefore, FDH conformation could not be directly related to the decrease of its fluorescence in ILs. Nevertheless, the structure of the FDH could be evaluated with dynamic and static quenchers like iodide or acrylamide, used below the MILc, demonstrating the relevance of this parameter. The Stern-Volmer constants (K(SV)(Q)), calculated in the presence of the different ILs, demonstrate that these ILs are strong denaturing agents, each one acting with a different mechanism.

Both proteins strongly interact with HTlc exhibiting in most cases a Langmuir-type adsorption.

Fluorescence measurements for adsorbed Mb showed that the inorganic nanoparticles induced conformational changes in the biomolecules; in particular, the interactions with HTlc surface quenched the tryptophan fluorescence and this process was particularly efficient for NiCr-HTlc.

Loss of endocytic nTSGs transforms imaginal disc epithelia into highly proliferative, invasive tissues that fail to differentiate and display defects in cellular apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization. Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis.","PMID":22101275,"authors":[{"lastName":"Robinson","initials":"BS","foreName":"Brian S"},{"lastName":"Moberg","initials":"KH","foreName":"Kenneth H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15296,"articleTitle":"Selective recognition of monohydrogen phosphate by fluorescence enhancement of a new cerium complex.","dateCreated":"2011-11-18","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-4324","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Analytica chimica acta","isoAbbreviation":"Anal.

The magnetic and specific heat behavior of M(2)(HPO(3))F(2) (M = Mn, Fe) have also been investigated. The compounds exhibit a global antiferromagnetic ordering with a spin canting phenomenon detected at approximately 30 K. The specific heat measurements show sharp λ-type peaks at 29.7 and 33.5 K for manganese and iron compounds, respectively. The total magnetic entropy is consistent with spin S = 5/2 and S = 2 of Mn(II) and Fe(II) cations.","PMID":22085224,"authors":[{"lastName":"Orive","initials":"J","foreName":"Joseba"},{"lastName":"Mesa","initials":"JL","foreName":"José L"},{"lastName":"Balda","initials":"R","foreName":"Rolindes"},{"lastName":"Fernández","initials":"J","foreName":"Joaquín"},{"lastName":"Fernández","initials":"JR","foreName":"Jesús Rodríguez"},{"lastName":"Rojo","initials":"T","foreName":"Teófilo"},{"lastName":"Arriortua","initials":"MI","foreName":"María I"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15373,"articleTitle":"Production and characteristics of the whole-cell lipase from organic solvent tolerant Burkholderia sp.

A glass column filled with XAD7HP resin was used to separate the filtered extracts into hydrophilic (WSOC(HPI)) and hydrophobic (WSOC(HPO)) fractions. The origins of air mass pathways arriving at the sampling site were mostly classified into three types, those originating over the East Sea of Korea that passed over the eastern inland urban and industrial regions (type I); those from the marine (western/southwestern/southern marine) and passed over the national industrial complex regions (type II); and those from northeastern China that passed through North Korea and metropolitan areas of South Korea (type III). Measurements showed an increase in the average WSOC fraction of total OC from the type II to III air mass (53 to 64%) periods. Also, higher SO(4)(2-)/SO(x) (=SO(2) + SO(4)(2-)) was observed in the type III air mass (0.70) than those in the types I (0.49) and II (0.43).

The relationship between the SO(4)(2-)/SO(x) and WSOC/OC (R(2) = 0.64) suggests that a significant fraction of the observed WSOC at the site could be formed by an oxidation process similar to SO(4)(2-) aerosols, probably the oxidation process using OH radicals, or in-cloud processing.

We have recently shown that the performance of semantic similarity searches can be improved by ranking results according to the probability of obtaining a given score at random rather than by the scores themselves. However, to date, there are no algorithms for computing the exact distribution of semantic similarity scores, which is necessary for computing the exact P-value of a given score.In this paper we consider the exact computation of score distributions for similarity searches in ontologies, and introduce a simple null hypothesis which can be used to compute a P-value for the statistical significance of similarity scores. We concentrate on measures based on Resnik's definition of ontological similarity. A new algorithm is proposed that collapses subgraphs of the ontology graph and thereby allows fast score distribution computation. The new algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the naive approach, as we demonstrate by computing score distributions for similarity searches in the HPO. It is shown that exact P-value calculation improves clinical diagnosis using the HPO compared to approaches based on sampling.The new algorithm enables for the first time exact P-value calculation via exact score distribution computation for ontology similarity searches. The approach is applicable to any ontology for which the annotation-propagation rule holds and can improve any bioinformatic method that makes only use of the raw similarity scores.

Yorkie activity in glial cells is controlled by a Merlin-Hippo signaling pathway, whereas the upstream Hippo pathway regulators Fat, Expanded, Crumbs and Lethal giant larvae have no detectable role. We extend functional characterization of Merlin-Hippo signaling by showing that Merlin and Hippo can be physically linked by the Salvador tumor suppressor. Yorkie promotes expression of the microRNA gene bantam in glia, and bantam promotes expression of Myc, which is required for Yorkie and bantam-induced glial proliferation. Our results provide new insights into the control of glial growth, and establish glia as a model for Merlin-specific Hippo signaling.

The impact of inoculum age, aeration, the supplementation of pectinase and nutrients on the ethanol fermentation performance of the CBP system was studied. Although inulinase activities increased with the extension of the seed incubation time, its contribution to ethanol production was negligible because vigorously growing yeast cells harvested earlier carried out ethanol fermentation more efficiently. Thus, the overnight incubation that has been practised in ethanol production from starch-based feedstocks is recommended. Aeration facilitated the fermentation process, but compromised ethanol yield because of the negative Crabtree effect of the species, and increases the risk of contamination under industrial conditions. Therefore, nonaeration conditions are preferred for the CBP system. Pectinase supplementation reduced viscosity of the fermentation broth and improved ethanol production performance, particularly under high gravity conditions, but the enzyme cost should be carefully balanced. Medium optimization was performed, and ethanol concentration as high as 94·2 g l(-1) was achieved when 0·15 g l(-1) K(2) HPO(4) was supplemented, which presents a significant progress in ethanol production from Jerusalem artichoke tubers.A CBP system using K. marxianus is suitable for efficient ethanol production from Jerusalem artichoke tubers under VHG conditions.Jerusalem artichoke tubers are an alternative to grain-based feedstocks for ethanol production.

The study of Drosophila genes that function as neoplastic tumor suppressors by regulating both of these properties has significant potential to clarify this relationship.Here we show in Drosophila that loss of Scribbled (Scrib), a cell polarity regulator and neoplastic tumor suppressor, results in impaired Hippo pathway signaling in the epithelial tissues of both the eye and wing imaginal disc. scrib mutant tissue overgrowth, but not the loss of cell polarity, is dependent upon defective Hippo signaling and can be rescued by knockdown of either the TEAD/TEF family transcription factor Scalloped or the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie in the eye disc, or reducing levels of Yorkie in the wing disc. Furthermore, loss of Scrib sensitizes tissue to transformation by oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling, and Yorkie-Scalloped activity is required to promote this cooperative tumor overgrowth. The inhibition of Hippo signaling in scrib mutant eye disc clones is not dependent upon JNK activity, but can be significantly rescued by reducing aPKC kinase activity, and ectopic aPKC activity is sufficient to impair Hippo signaling in the eye disc, even when JNK signaling is blocked. In contrast, warts mutant overgrowth does not require aPKC activity. Moreover, reducing endogenous levels of aPKC or increasing Scrib or Lethal giant larvae levels does not promote increased Hippo signaling, suggesting that aPKC activity is not normally rate limiting for Hippo pathway activity. Epistasis experiments suggest that Hippo pathway inhibition in scrib mutants occurs, at least in part, downstream or in parallel to both the Expanded and Fat arms of Hippo pathway regulation.Loss of Scrib promotes Yorkie/Scalloped-dependent epithelial tissue overgrowth, and this is also important for driving cooperative tumor overgrowth with oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling. Whether this is also the case in human cancers now warrants investigation since the cell polarity function of Scrib and its capacity to restrain oncogene-mediated transformation, as well as the tissue growth control function of the Hippo pathway, are conserved in mammals.","PMID":21955824,"authors":[{"lastName":"Doggett","initials":"K","foreName":"Karen"},{"lastName":"Grusche","initials":"FA","foreName":"Felix A"},{"lastName":"Richardson","initials":"HE","foreName":"Helena E"},{"lastName":"Brumby","initials":"AM","foreName":"Anthony M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15314,"articleTitle":"Biomimetic mineralization of dentin induced by agarose gel loaded with calcium phosphate.","dateCreated":"2011-12-06","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1552-4981","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of biomedical materials research.

The probe is available as cell membrane permeable methyl ester 8-(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)-4,4-difluoro-3-[2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethenyl]-1,5,7-trimethyl-3a,4a-diaza-4-bora-s-indacene (I) and corresponding water-soluble sodium carboxylate, sodium 8-(4-carboxylatophenyl)-4,4-difluoro-3-[2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethenyl]-1,5,7-trimethyl-3a,4a-diaza-4-bora-s-indacene (II). The fluorescence quantum yield Φ(f) of ester I is very high (0.8-1.0) in the organic solvents tested. The fluorescence lifetime (ca. 4 ns) of I in organic solvents with varying polarity/polarizability (from cyclohexane to acetonitrile) is independent of the solvent with a fluorescence rate constant k(f) of 2.4×10(8) s(-1). Probe I is readily loaded in the cytosol of live cells, where its high fluorescence intensity remains nearly constant over an extended time period. Water-soluble indicator II exhibits two acid-base equilibria in aqueous solution, characterized by pK(a) values of 6.0 and 12.6. The Φ(f) value of II in aqueous solution is high: 0.6 for the cationic and anionic forms of the imidazole ligand, and 0.8 for neutral imidazole. On protonation-deprotonation in the near-neutral pH range, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectral shifts along with isosbestic and pseudo-isoemissive points are observed. This dual-excitation and dual-emission pH indicator emits intense green-yellow fluorescence at lower pH and intense orange fluorescence at higher pH. The influence of ionic strength and buffer concentration on the absorbance and steady-state fluorescence of II has also been investigated. The apparent pK(a) of the near-neutral acid-base equilibrium determined by spectrophotometric and fluorometric titration is nearly independent of the added buffer and salt concentration. In aqueous solution in the absence of buffer and in the pH range 5.20-7.45, dual exponential fluorescence decays are obtained with decay time τ(1)=4.3 ns for the cationic and τ(2)=3.3 ns for the neutral form of II. The excited-state proton exchange of II at near-neutral pH becomes reversible on addition of phosphate (H(2)PO(4)(-)/HPO(4)(2-)) buffer, and a pH-dependent change of the fluorescence decay times is induced. Global compartmental analysis of fluorescence decay traces collected as a function of pH and phosphate buffer concentration was used to recover values of the deactivation rate constants of the excited cationic (k(01)=2.4×10(8) s(-1)) and neutral (k(02)=3.0×10(8) s(-1)) forms of II.","PMID":21932233,"authors":[{"lastName":"Boens","initials":"N","foreName":"Noël"},{"lastName":"Qin","initials":"W","foreName":"Wenwu"},{"lastName":"Baruah","initials":"M","foreName":"Mukulesh"},{"lastName":"De Borggraeve","initials":"WM","foreName":"Wim M"},{"lastName":"Filarowski","initials":"A","foreName":"Aleksander"},{"lastName":"Smisdom","initials":"N","foreName":"Nick"},{"lastName":"Ameloot","initials":"M","foreName":"Marcel"},{"lastName":"Crovetto","initials":"L","foreName":"Luis"},{"lastName":"Talavera","initials":"EM","foreName":"Eva M"},{"lastName":"Alvarez-Pez","initials":"JM","foreName":"Jose M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15245,"articleTitle":"Development and evaluation of a spiral tube column for counter-current chromatography.","dateCreated":"2011-09-28","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1615-9314","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of separation science","isoAbbreviation":"J Sep Sci"},"articleDate":"2011-09-05","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"An improved type-J counter-current chromatography (CCC) planet centrifuge with two spiral tube columns (volume 2×15 mL, β value 0.3-0.7, tubing 0.8 mm id) was developed and evaluated for its retention ability of four typical different solvent systems including heptane-methanol (1:1, v/v) (A), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:1:1:1, v/v) (B), n-butanol-acetic acid-water (4:1:5, v/v) (C), PEG1000-K(2)HPO(4)-water (12.5:12.5:75, w/w) (D) under eight different operation modes.

The results revealed that anions had more pronounced effects than cations in tuning the nanostructures formed from these peptides. Addition of ClO(3)(-), NO(3)(-), and Br(-) could stabilize the primary nanostructures (nanostacks, nanospheres, or short nanorods) formed by A(9)K and I(3)K and effectively inhibit their growth into longer nanostructures (nanorods or nanotubes). In contrast, the anions of Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), HPO(4)(2-), PO(4)(3-), and C(6)H(5)O(7)(3-) (citrate) favored the axial growth of these peptides to form long intersecting nanofibrils and led to an increase in diameter and surface roughness, as well, clearly enhancing their propensity for nanostructuring. The efficiency of different anions in promoting the growth of peptide nanoaggregates into larger ones could be ordered as ClO(3)(-) < NO(3)(-) ≤ Br(-) < Cl(-) < SO(4)(2-) < HPO(4)(2-) < PO(4)(3-) < C(6)H(5)O(7)(3-), broadly consistent with the Hofmeister anion sequence.

RNAi-mediated inactivation of Yki, or its partner Scalloped (Sd), or increased activity of the upstream negative regulators of Yki cause a dramatic reorganization of the eye disc fate map leading to specification of the entire disc epithelium into retina. On the contrary, constitutive expression of Yki suppresses eye formation in a Sd-dependent fashion. We also show that knockdown of the transcription factor Homothorax (Hth), known to partner Yki in some developmental contexts, also induces an ectopic retina domain, that Yki and Scalloped regulate Hth expression, and that the gain-of-function activity of Yki is partially dependent on Hth.

CEST enabled observation of Hε2 at neutral pH values, and also allowed measurement of solvent exchange rates for His57-Hδ1 and His57-Hε2 across a wide pH range (3-10). Hδ1 exchange was only dependent upon the charge state of the His57 (k (ex,Im+) = 470 s(-1), k (ex,Im) = 50 s(-1)), while Hε2 exchange was found to be catalyzed by hydroxide ion and phosphate base (k(OH)\u207b = 1.7 × 10(10) M(-1) s(-1), K(HPO)²\u207b\u2084 = 1.7 × 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)), reflecting its greater exposure to solute catalysts. Concomitant with the disappearance of the Hε2 signal as the pH was increased above its pK (a), was the appearance of a novel signal (δ = 12 ppm), which we assigned to Hγ of the nearby Ser195 nucleophile, that is hydrogen bonded to Nε2 of neutral His57. The chemical shift of Hγ is about 7 ppm downfield from a typical hydroxyl proton, suggesting a highly polarized O-Hγ bond. The significant alkoxide character of Oγ indicates that Ser195 is preactivated for nucleophilic attack before substrate binding. CEST should be generally useful for mechanistic investigations of many enzymes with labile protons involved in active site chemistry.","PMID":21809183,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lauzon","initials":"CB","foreName":"Carolyn B"},{"lastName":"van Zijl","initials":"P","foreName":"Peter"},{"lastName":"Stivers","initials":"JT","foreName":"James T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15188,"articleTitle":"The Hippo pathway in organ size control, tissue regeneration and stem cell self-renewal.","dateCreated":"2011-08-02","dateRevised":"2016-10-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1476-4679","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nature cell biology","isoAbbreviation":"Nat.

In Drosophila and mammals, studies over the past decade have uncovered a critical role for the Hippo tumour-suppressor pathway in the regulation of organ size. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to massive overgrowth of tissue. The Hippo signalling pathway is highly conserved and limits organ size by phosphorylating and inhibiting the transcription co-activators YAP and TAZ in mammals and Yki in Drosophila, key regulators of proliferation and apoptosis. The Hippo pathway also has a critical role in the self-renewal and expansion of stem cells and tissue-specific progenitor cells, and has important functions in tissue regeneration. Emerging evidence shows that the Hippo pathway is regulated by cell polarity, cell adhesion and cell junction proteins. In this review we summarize current understanding of the composition and regulation of the Hippo pathway, and discuss how cell polarity and cell adhesion proteins inform the role of this pathway in organ size control and regeneration.","PMID":21808241,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"B","foreName":"Bin"},{"lastName":"Tumaneng","initials":"K","foreName":"Karen"},{"lastName":"Guan","initials":"KL","foreName":"Kun-Liang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15188,"articleTitle":"Excited-state geometries and vibrational frequencies studied using the analytical energy gradients of the direct symmetry-adapted cluster-configuration interaction method.

Multiple signaling cascades coordinate to control the follicle cell fate determination, including Notch, JAK/STAT, and Hedgehog signaling pathways. Here, we show that the Hippo pathway also participates in polar cell specification. Over-activation of yorkie (yki) leads to egg chamber fusion, possibly through attenuation of polar cell specification. Loss-of-function experiments using RNAi knockdown or generation of mutant clones by mitotic recombination demonstrates that reduction of yki expression promotes polar cell formation in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistently, polar cells mutant for hippo (hpo) or warts (wts) are not properly specified, leading to egg chamber fusion. Furthermore, Notch activity is increased in yki mutant cells and reduction of Notch activity suppresses polar cell formation in yki mutant clones. These results demonstrate that yki represses polar cell fate through Notch signaling. Collectively, our data reveal that the Hippo pathway controls polar cell specification. Through repressing Notch activity, Yki serves as a key repressor in specifying polar cells during Drosophila oogenesis.","PMID":21781961,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"HJ","foreName":"Hsi-Ju"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"CM","foreName":"Chi-Ming"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"TW","foreName":"Tsu-Wei"},{"lastName":"Liaw","initials":"GJ","foreName":"Gwo-Jen"},{"lastName":"Hsu","initials":"TH","foreName":"Ta-Hsing"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"TH","foreName":"Tzu-Huai"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"JY","foreName":"Jenn-Yah"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15184,"articleTitle":"Selective extraction of alkaloids in human urine by on-line single drop microextraction coupled with sweeping micellar electrokinetic chromatography.","dateCreated":"2011-07-29","dateRevised":"2011-07-29","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3778","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of chromatography.

The recently identified Hippo signaling pathway has been implicated in contact inhibition of proliferation as well as organ size control. The modulation of the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by the highly conserved kinase cascade of the Hippo signaling pathway has been intensively studied. However, cell-surface receptors regulating the Hippo signaling pathway in mammals are not well understood. In this study, we show that Hippo signaling pathway components are required for E-cadherin-dependent contact inhibition of proliferation. Knockdown of the Hippo signaling components or overexpression of YAP inhibits the decrease in cell proliferation caused by E-cadherin homophilic binding at the cell surface, independent of other cell-cell interactions. We also demonstrate that the E-cadherin/catenin complex functions as an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Expression of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells restores the density-dependent regulation of YAP nuclear exclusion. Knockdown of β-catenin in densely cultured MCF10A cells, which mainly depletes E-cadherin-bound β-catenin, induces a decrease in the phosphorylation of S127 residue of YAP and its nuclear accumulation. Moreover, E-cadherin homophilic binding independent of other cell interactions is sufficient to control the subcellular localization of YAP. Therefore, Our results indicate that, in addition to its role in cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact directly regulates the Hippo signaling pathway to control cell proliferation.","PMID":21730131,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kim","initials":"NG","foreName":"Nam-Gyun"},{"lastName":"Koh","initials":"E","foreName":"Eunjin"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiao"},{"lastName":"Gumbiner","initials":"BM","foreName":"Barry M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15217,"articleTitle":"Strong inclusion of inorganic anions into β-cyclodextrin immobilized to gold electrode.","dateCreated":"2011-08-31","dateRevised":"2012-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5827","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","isoAbbreviation":"Langmuir"},"articleDate":"2011-07-26","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The inclusion of inorganic anions such as SO(4)(2-), NO(3)(-), and HPO(4)(2-) into the cavity of β-cyclodextrin monolayers on Au was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and chronocoulometric measurements of the competitive inclusion with ferrocene.

Two types of Drosophila optic lobe neurons, lamina and medulla neurons, are derived from the neuroepithelial (NE) cells of the outer optic anlagen. During larval development, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Ras signaling sweeps the NE field from the medial edge and drives medulla neuroblast (NB) formation. This signal drives the transient expression of a proneural gene, lethal of scute, and we refer to its signal array as the \"proneural wave,\" as it is the marker of the EGFR/Ras signaling front. In this study, we show that the atypical cadherin Fat and the downstream Hippo pathways regulate the transduction of EGFR/Ras signaling along the NE field and, thus, ensure the progress of NB differentiation. Fat/Hippo pathway mutation also disrupts the pattern formation of the medulla structure, which is associated with the regulation of neurogenesis.

Despite rapid progress in recent years, key steps in the pathway remain poorly understood, in part due to the incomplete identification of components. Through a genetic screen, we identified the Drosophila Zyxin family gene, Zyx102 (Zyx), as a component of the Hippo pathway. Zyx positively regulates the Hippo pathway transcriptional co-activator Yorkie, as its loss reduces Yorkie activity and organ growth. Through epistasis tests, we position the requirement for Zyx within the Fat branch of Hippo signaling, downstream of Fat and Dco, and upstream of the Yorkie kinase Warts, and we find that Zyx is required for the influence of Fat on Warts protein levels. Zyx localizes to the sub-apical membrane, with distinctive peaks of accumulation at intercellular vertices. This partially overlaps the membrane localization of the myosin Dachs, which has similar effects on Fat-Hippo signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Zyx can bind to Dachs and that Dachs stimulates binding of Zyx to Warts. We also extend characterization of the Ajuba LIM protein Jub and determine that although Jub and Zyx share C-terminal LIM domains, they regulate Hippo signaling in distinct ways. Our results identify a role for Zyx in the Hippo pathway and suggest a mechanism for the role of Dachs: because Fat regulates the localization of Dachs to the membrane, where it can overlap with Zyx, we propose that the regulated localization of Dachs influences downstream signaling by modulating Zyx-Warts binding. Mammalian Zyxin proteins have been implicated in linking effects of mechanical strain to cell behavior. Our identification of Zyx as a regulator of Hippo signaling thus also raises the possibility that mechanical strain could be linked to the regulation of gene expression and growth through Hippo signaling.","PMID":21666802,"authors":[{"lastName":"Rauskolb","initials":"C","foreName":"Cordelia"},{"lastName":"Pan","initials":"G","foreName":"Guohui"},{"lastName":"Reddy","initials":"BV","foreName":"B V V G"},{"lastName":"Oh","initials":"H","foreName":"Hyangyee"},{"lastName":"Irvine","initials":"KD","foreName":"Kenneth D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15351,"articleTitle":"Willin/FRMD6 expression activates the Hippo signaling pathway kinases in mammals and antagonizes oncogenic YAP.","dateCreated":"2012-01-12","dateRevised":"2012-01-12","publication":{"issnNumber":"1476-5594","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Oncogene","isoAbbreviation":"Oncogene"},"articleDate":"2011-06-13","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Salvador/Warts/Hippo (Hippo) signaling pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell contact inhibition, organ size control, cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and cancer development in mammals.

One of the most frequently mutated genes detected in MM cells is the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene which is located at chromosome 22q12. The NF2 gene encodes Merlin, an ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) protein. The underphosphorylated form of Merlin is active and acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating several distinct cellular signaling pathways. One of the downstream pathways regulated by Merlin is the Hippo signaling pathway, which is conserved from Drosophila to mammalian cells and plays important roles in organ size control and cancer development. Recent studies have identified alterations of the components in the Hippo signaling cascade in MM cells, including overexpression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and inactivation of large tumor suppressor homolog 2 (LATS2). Dysregulation of the Merlin-Hippo signaling cascade is one of the frequent and key events of MM cell development and/or progression.

The Hpo pathway is a crucial growth regulatory network whose inactivation in Drosophila epithelial tissues induces massive overproliferation. Its core consists of a phosphorylation cascade (comprising the kinases Hpo and Warts) that mediates the inactivation of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yki [Yorkie; YAP (Yes-associated protein) in mammals]. Several apically located proteins, such as Merlin, Expanded or Kibra, have been identified as upstream regulators of the Hpo pathway, leading to the notion that an apical multi-molecular complex modulates core kinase activity and promotes Yki/YAP inactivation.

The results indicated that the efficiency of protein immobilization did not correlate with the MW of the protein. In contrast, the efficiency of protein immobilization was strongly related to the pI of the protein. As the pI decreased the efficiency of protein immobilization increased due to the high adsorption affinity of negatively charged acidic proteins for positively charged apatite crystals and/or apatite precursors in the CP solution. Thus, the use of acidic rather than basic proteins improves the immobilization efficiency in the present coating process.","PMID":21536155,"authors":[{"lastName":"Oyane","initials":"A","foreName":"Ayako"},{"lastName":"Ootsuka","initials":"T","foreName":"Teruhisa"},{"lastName":"Hayama","initials":"K","foreName":"Kazumi"},{"lastName":"Sogo","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yu"},{"lastName":"Ito","initials":"A","foreName":"Atsuo"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15097,"articleTitle":"Optimization of medium constituents for ε-poly-L-lysine fermentation with response surface methodology.","dateCreated":"2011-05-03","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1750-3841","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of food science","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Interestingly, F-actin also accumulates abnormally when Hippo pathway activity is reduced or abolished, independently of Yorkie activity, whereas overexpression of the Hippo pathway component expanded can partially reverse the abnormal accumulation of F-actin in cells depleted for Capping Protein.

All surviving mice eventually developed both cholangiocellular and hepatocellular carcinoma,suggesting that Nf2-/-progenitors can be a cell of origin for these tumors. Despite the suggested link between NF2 and the Hpo/Wts/Yki signaling pathway in Drosophila, and recent studies linking the corresponding Mst/Lats/Yap pathway to mammalian liver tumorigenesis, our molecular studies suggest that Merlin is not a major regulator of YAP in liver progenitors,and that the overproliferation of Nf2-/-liver progenitors is instead driven by aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity. Indeed, pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR blocks the proliferation of Nf2-/-liver progenitors in vitro and in vivo, consistent with recent studies indicating that the NF2-encoded protein Merlin can control the abundance and signaling of membrane receptors such as EGFR.

This was observed in both the HPO and HPR phases, while the P(1)+P(3) band did not split in the liquid phase. The separation of the peaks in the P(1)+P(3) band changed discontinuously at the HPO-HPR and HPR-liquid phase transitions, even though the separation is known to change continuously in the transition from the liquid to the high temperature rotator (HTR) phase. In the HPR phase, the ratio of the intensities of the higher and lower frequency components in the P(1)+P(3) doublet is roughly unity independent of pressure, while it is known to be much less than unity in the HTR phase. The separation of the P(1)+P(3) doublet in the HPR phase is found to be larger for longer alkanes. From the intensity ratio, a large proportion of alkane molecules is believed to participate in intermolecular vibrational coupling and possess herringbone-type short-range positional order in the HPR phase. Conversely, in the HTR phase only small proportion of alkane molecules participate in intermolecular vibrational coupling.

The reactant CaHPO(4) was also custom synthesized from the respective CaCO(3) source. A low firing temperature in the range of 1150-1350°C promoted formation of β-polymorph as a second phase in the resultant TCP. Meanwhile, higher firing temperatures resulted in phase pure α-TCP with poor hydraulic reactivity. The extension of firing operation also led to a decrease in the reactivity. It was found that identical synthesis history, morphology, particle size and crystallinity match between the α-TCPs produced from different CaCO(3) sources do not essentially culminate in products exhibiting similar hydraulic reactivity. The changes in reactivity are arising from differences in the trace amount of impurities found in the CaCO(3) precursors. In this regard, a correlation between the observed hydraulic reactivities and the impurity content of the CaCO(3) powders--as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry--has been established. A high level of magnesium impurity in the CaCO(3) almost completely hampers the hydration of α-TCP. This impurity also favors formation of β- instead of α-polymorph in the product of TCP upon firing.","PMID":21445656,"authors":[{"lastName":"Cicek","initials":"G","foreName":"Gulcin"},{"lastName":"Aksoy","initials":"EA","foreName":"Eda Ayse"},{"lastName":"Durucan","initials":"C","foreName":"Caner"},{"lastName":"Hasirci","initials":"N","foreName":"Nesrin"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15076,"articleTitle":"Hydrotrope-induced inversion of salt effects on the cloud point of an extended surfactant.","dateCreated":"2011-04-12","dateRevised":"2011-04-12","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5827","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","isoAbbreviation":"Langmuir"},"articleDate":"2011-03-28","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We report on the effects of electrolytes spanning a range of anions (NaOc, NaSCN, NaNO(3), NaBr, NaCl, NaBu, NaOAc, Na(2)SO(4), Na(2)HPO(4), and Na(2)CO(3)) and cations (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsCl, and choline chloride) on the aqueous solubility of an extended surfactant. The surfactant is anionic with a long hydrophobic tail as well as a significant fraction of propylene oxide groups and ethylene oxide groups (C(12-14)-PO(16)-EO(2)-SO(4)Na, X-AES).

These shifts follow precisely the same Hofmeister series that is found for salting-in and salting-out effects in protein solutions. In the presence of different concentrations of sodium xylene sulfonate (SXS), the solubility of the surfactant increases. In this context, SXS can be considered to be a salting-in salt.

Although bicarbonate addition caused less desorption of arsenic than phosphate on the mole basis, an elevated arsenic concentration of 56 μg/L in the batch solutions was observed when the added bicarbonate contents was up to 1500 mg/L.

This is, however, quite a challenging task due to their delicate nature. In this context, recent reports have claimed successful exploitation of the capacity of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for imaging of extremely deformable (even liquid) surfaces under ambient conditions to detect bacterial capsules in the form of tiny amounts of liquid-like substances around bacteria. In order to further explore this supposed capacity of AFM, in this work, three staphylococcal strains have been scrutinized for the presence of capsules using such an AFM-based approach with a phosphate buffer and water as the suspending liquids. Similar results were obtained with the three strains. AFM showed the presence of liquid-like substances identical to those attributed to bacterial capsules in the previous literature. Extensive imaging and chemical analysis point out the central role of the suspending liquid (buffer) in the formation of these substances. The phenomenon has been reproduced even by using nonliving particles, a finding that refutes the biological origin of the liquid-like substances visualized around the cells. Deliquescence of major components of biological buffers, such as K(2)HPO(4), CaCl(2), or HEPES, is proposed as the fundamental mechanism of the formation of these ultrasmall liquid-like structures. Such an origin could explain the high similarity of our results obtained with three very different strains and also the high similarity of these results to others reported in the literature based on other bacteria and suspending liquids. Finally, possible biological/biomedical implications of the presence of these ultrasmall amounts of liquids wrapping microorganisms are discussed.","PMID":21398482,"authors":[{"lastName":"Méndez-Vilas","initials":"A","foreName":"A"},{"lastName":"Labajos-Broncano","initials":"L","foreName":"L"},{"lastName":"Perera-Núñez","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"González-Martín","initials":"ML","foreName":"M L"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15043,"articleTitle":"Mechanism of Zn stabilization in hydroxyapatite and hydrated (0 0 1) surfaces of hydroxyapatite.","dateCreated":"2011-03-10","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1361-648X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of physics.

A Zn substituted hydroxyapatite relaxed structure is obtained through a periodic cell DFT geometry optimization method. Electronic structure properties are calculated by using both cluster DFT and periodic cell EHTB methods. Bond order calculations show that Zn preference for the Ca2 vacancy, near the OH channel and with greater structural flexibility, is associated with the formation of a four-fold (bulk) and nearly four-fold (surface) coordination, as in ZnO. When occupying the octahedral Ca1 vacancy, Zn remains six-fold in the bulk, but coordination decreases to five-fold in the surface. In the bulk and surface, Zn2 is found to be more covalent than Zn1, due to a decrease in bond lengths at the four-fold site, which approach the 1.99 Å ZnO value. Zn is however considerably less bound in the biomaterial than in the oxide, where calculated bond orders are twice as large as in HA. Surface phosphate groups (PO(4)) and hydroxide ions behave as compact individual units as in the bulk; no evidence is found for the presence of HPO(4). Ca-O bond orders decrease at the surface, with a consequent increase in ionicity.

The method was based on the selective retention of inorganic As(V) that was carried out by passing the filtered original sample through a cartridge containing a chloride-form strong anion exchanger. Thus the most toxic form, inorganic As(III), was determined fast and directly by AsH(3) generation using 3.5 mol L(-1) HCl as carrier solution and 0.35% (m/v) NaBH(4) in 0.025% NaOH as the reductant. Since the uptake of As(V) should be interfered by several anions of natural occurrence in waters, the effect of Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), NO(3)(-), HPO(4)(2-), HCO(3)(-) on retention was evaluated and discussed. The total soluble inorganic arsenic concentration was determined on aliquots of filtered samples acidified with concentrated HCl and pre-reduced with 5% KI-5% C(6)H(8)O(6) solution. The concentration of As(V) was calculated by difference between the total soluble inorganic arsenic and As(III) concentrations. Detection limits (LODs) of 0.5 μg L(-1) and 0.6 μg L(-1) for As(III) and inorganic total As, respectively, were obtained for a 500 μL sample volume. The obtained limits of detection allowed testing the water quality according to the national and international regulations. The analytical recovery for water samples spiked with As(III) ranged between 98% and 106%. The sampling throughput for As(III) determination was 60 samplesh(-1).

It is composed of three components: cell surface upstream regulators including cell adhesion molecules and cell polarity complexes; a kinase cascade comprising two serine-threonine kinases with regulators and adaptors; and a downstream target, a transcription coactivator. The coactivator mediates the transcription of cell proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. The pathway negatively regulates the coactivator to restrict cell proliferation and to promote cell death. Thus, the pathway prevents tissue overgrowth and tumourigenesis. The framework of the pathway is conserved in mammals. A dysfunction of the pathway is frequently detected in human cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis.

One is the mechanism of IL-salt ILATPS formation, the other is solvent sublation. This method was practical when applied to the analysis of chloramphenicol in lake water, feed water, milk, and honey samples with the linear range of 0.5-500 ng mL(-1). The method yielded limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 ng mL(-1) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.3 ng mL(-1). The recovery of CAP was 97.1-101.9% from aqueous samples of environmental and food samples by the proposed method. Compared with liquid-liquid extraction, solvent sublation and ionic liquid aqueous two-phase extraction, ILATPF can not only separate and concentrate chloramphenicol with high sublation efficiency, but also efficiently reduce the wastage of IL. This novel technique is much simpler and more environmentally friendly and is suggested to have important applications for the concentration and separation of other small biomolecules.","PMID":21168562,"authors":[{"lastName":"Han","initials":"J","foreName":"Juan"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yun"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"C","foreName":"Cuilan"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"C","foreName":"Chunxiang"},{"lastName":"Yan","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yongsheng"},{"lastName":"Liu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yan"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"L","foreName":"Liang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14963,"articleTitle":"Selenium speciation analysis at trace level in soils.","dateCreated":"2010-12-20","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-4324","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Analytica chimica acta","isoAbbreviation":"Anal.

Bone nodule formation is one of the hallmarks of mineralization in such cell cultures. In this study, we developed a new two-step procedure to accelerate bone formation in which mouse bone cell aggregates were produced first on various chemically treated non-adhesive substrates. After this step, the bone cells' growth and mineralization were followed in conventional culture plates. The number and size of cell aggregates were studied with light microscopy. The minerals' formation in the form of nodules produced by the cell aggregates and the bone crystal quality were studied with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of the ash specimens (mineral phase only) from thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) provided valuable information of the quality of the minerals. The υ(4) PO(4) region (550-650 cm(-1)), which reveals apatitic and non-apatitic HPO(4) or PO(4) environments, and phosphate region (910-1180 cm(-1)) were examined for the minerals produced in the form of nodules. The peak position and intensity of the spectra demonstrate that the quality of the bone produced by cell aggregates, especially from the bigger ones, which were formed on Plunoric treated substrates, exhibit a composition more similar to that of native bone.

We also show that depletion of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes, including lethal giant larvae and discs large, or activation of aPKC, activates Yorkie through Jun kinase signaling, and that Jun kinase activation is necessary, but not sufficient, for the disruption of apical-basal polarity associated with loss of lethal giant larvae. Our observations identify Jnk signaling as a modulator of Hippo pathway activity in wing imaginal discs, and implicate Yorkie activation in compensatory cell proliferation and disc regeneration.","PMID":21145886,"authors":[{"lastName":"Sun","initials":"G","foreName":"Gongping"},{"lastName":"Irvine","initials":"KD","foreName":"Kenneth D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14984,"articleTitle":"Preparation and characterization of activated carbon produced from rice straw by (NH4)2HPO4 activation.","dateCreated":"2011-01-10","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-2976","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Bioresource technology","isoAbbreviation":"Bioresour.

Regenerative potential differs greatly between organs and organisms; for example some amphibians can regrow entire limbs whereas mammals cannot. The process of regeneration relies on several signaling pathways that control developmental tissue growth, and implies the existence of organ size-control checkpoints that regulate both developmental, and regenerative, growth. Here we explore the role of one such checkpoint, the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway, in tissue regeneration. The Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway limits tissue growth by repressing the Yorkie transcriptional co-activator. Several proteins serve as upstream modulators of this pathway including the atypical cadherins, Dachsous and Fat, whilst the atypical myosin, Dachs, functions downstream of Fat to activate Yorkie. Using Drosophila melanogaster imaginal discs we show that Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway activity is repressed in regenerating tissue and that Yorkie is rate-limiting for regeneration of the developing wing. We show that regeneration is compromised in dachs mutant wing discs, but that proteins in addition to Fat and Dachs are likely to modulate Yorkie activity in regenerating cells. In conclusion our data reveal the importance of Yorkie hyperactivation for tissue regeneration and suggest that multiple upstream inputs, including Fat-Dachsous signaling, sense tissue damage and regulate Yorkie activity during regeneration of epithelial tissues.","PMID":21111727,"authors":[{"lastName":"Grusche","initials":"FA","foreName":"Felix A"},{"lastName":"Degoutin","initials":"JL","foreName":"Joffrey L"},{"lastName":"Richardson","initials":"HE","foreName":"Helena E"},{"lastName":"Harvey","initials":"KF","foreName":"Kieran F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15188,"articleTitle":"Comparison of dissolved organic matter fractions in a secondary effluent and a natural water.","dateCreated":"2011-08-02","dateRevised":"2017-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1573-2959","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Environmental monitoring and assessment","isoAbbreviation":"Environ Monit Assess"},"articleDate":"2010-11-25","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"This research compared the structural and chemical characteristics among dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions within the same source and among different origins.

In the adult Drosophila midgut, the Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in damaged enterocyte cells (ECs) following injury. This leads to the production of Upd cytokines from ECs, which in turn activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in Intestinal SCs (ISCs), stimulating their proliferation. In addition, the Hippo pathway has been recently implicated in the regulation of Upd production from the ECs. Here, we show that the Hippo pathway target, Yorkie (Yki), also plays a crucial and cell-autonomous role in ISCs. Activation of Yki in ISCs is sufficient to increase ISC proliferation, a process involving Yki target genes that promote division, survival and the Upd cytokines. We further show that prior to injury, Yki activity is constitutively repressed by the upstream Hippo pathway members Fat and Dachsous (Ds). These findings demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for the Hippo pathway in SCs, and have implications for understanding the role of this pathway in tumorigenesis and cancer stem cells.","PMID":21098564,"authors":[{"lastName":"Karpowicz","initials":"P","foreName":"Phillip"},{"lastName":"Perez","initials":"J","foreName":"Jessica"},{"lastName":"Perrimon","initials":"N","foreName":"Norbert"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14995,"articleTitle":"Antibacterial action of polyphosphate on Porphyromonas gingivalis.","dateCreated":"2011-01-21","dateRevised":"2015-02-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"1098-6596","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","isoAbbreviation":"Antimicrob.

In order to clarify this point, the aim of this work is to obtain further evidence about the salting-out effect produced by the addition of different salts to aqueous solutions of water miscible ionic liquids by evaluating the effect of a large series of salts on the vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid-liquid phase diagram, volumetric, compressibility, and conductometric properties of ionic liquids 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium halide ([C(n)mim][X]). In the first part of this work, the experimental measurements of water activity at 298.15 and 308.15 K for aqueous binary and ternary solutions containing 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([Rmim][Br], R = butyl (C(4)), heptyl (C(7)), and octyl (C(8))), sodium dihydrogen citrate (NaH(2)Cit), disodium hydrogen citrate (Na(2)HCit), and trisodium citrate (Na(3)Cit) are taken using both vapor pressure osmometry (VPO) and improved isopiestic methods. The effect of temperature, charge on the anion of sodium citrate salts, and alkyl chain length of ionic liquids on the vapor-liquid equilibria properties of the investigated systems are studied. The constant water activity lines of all the ternary systems show large negative deviation from the linear isopiestic relation (Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson rule) derived using the semi-ideal hydration model, and the vapor pressure depression for a ternary solution is much larger than the sum of those for the corresponding binary solutions with the same molality of the ternary solution.

We have investigated the role of the Hippo (Hpo) pathway in the Drosophila intestine (midgut). Hpo pathway inactivation in either the ISCs or the differentiated enterocytes induces a phenotype similar to that observed under stress situations, including increased stem cell proliferation and expression of Jak/Stat pathway ligands. Hpo pathway targets are induced by stresses such as bacterial infection, suggesting that the Hpo pathway functions as a sensor of cellular stress in the differentiated cells of the midgut.

It was demonstrated that dissociation of an L = H\u2082PO\u2082\u207b ligand from 6 facilitates the direct O-O bond formation that proceeds with a 28.3 (33.4) kcal/mol rate-determining energy barrier at the transition state TS1. This step (the O-O single bond formation) of the reaction is a two-electron oxidation/reduction process, during which two oxo ligands are transformed into to μ²:η²-O\u2082²\u207b unit, and two (\"distal\") Mn centers are reduced from the 4+ to the 3+ oxidation state. Next two-electron oxidation/reduction occurs by \"dancing\" of the resulted O\u2082²\u207b fragment between the Mn¹ and Mn²/Mn(2')-centers, keeping its strong coordination to the Mn(1')-center. As a result of this four-electron oxidation/reduction process Mn centers of the Mn\u2084-core of I transform from {Mn¹(III)-Mn(1')(III)-Mn²(IV)-Mn(2')(IV)} to {Mn¹(II)-Mn(1')(II)-Mn²(III)-Mn(2')(III)} in IV. In other words, upon O\u2082 formation in cationic complex [Mn\u2084O\u2084L\u2085](+), I, all four Mn-centers are reduced by one electron each.

It has been speculated that competition between different cell populations within a growing organ might play a role as either tumor promoter or tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context. The evolutionarily conserved Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway regulates organ size and prevents hyperplastic disease from flies to humans by restricting the activity of the transcriptional cofactor Yorkie (yki). Recent data indicate also that mutations in several Hpo pathway members provide cells with a competitive advantage by unknown mechanisms. Here we provide insight into the mechanism by which the Hpo pathway is linked to cell competition, by identifying dMyc as a target gene of the Hpo pathway, transcriptionally upregulated by the activity of Yki with different binding partners. We show that the cell-autonomous upregulation of dMyc is required for the supercompetitive behavior of Yki-expressing cells and Hpo pathway mutant cells, whereas the relative levels of dMyc between Hpo pathway mutant cells and wild-type neighboring cells are critical for determining whether cell competition promotes a tumor-suppressing or tumor-inducing behavior. All together, these data provide a paradigmatic example of cooperation between tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in tumorigenesis and suggest a dual role for cell competition during tumor progression depending on the output of the genetic interactions occurring between confronted cells.","PMID":20885789,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ziosi","initials":"M","foreName":"Marcello"},{"lastName":"Baena-López","initials":"LA","foreName":"Luis Alberto"},{"lastName":"Grifoni","initials":"D","foreName":"Daniela"},{"lastName":"Froldi","initials":"F","foreName":"Francesca"},{"lastName":"Pession","initials":"A","foreName":"Andrea"},{"lastName":"Garoia","initials":"F","foreName":"Flavio"},{"lastName":"Trotta","initials":"V","foreName":"Vincenzo"},{"lastName":"Bellosta","initials":"P","foreName":"Paola"},{"lastName":"Cavicchi","initials":"S","foreName":"Sandro"},{"lastName":"Pession","initials":"A","foreName":"Annalisa"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14901,"articleTitle":"Naked-eye determination of oxalate anion in aqueous solution with copper ion and pyrocatechol violet.","dateCreated":"2010-10-19","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1364-5528","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Analyst","isoAbbreviation":"Analyst"},"articleDate":"2010-09-28","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A novel strategy for the determination of oxalate anions was successfully established using a copper ion and pyrocatechol violet (PV) ensemble.

Three recent papers have shown that the apico-basal polarity determinants Lgl/aPKC and Crb regulate tissue growth independently of their roles in cell polarity and coordinately regulate cell proliferation and cell death via the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway. Lgl/aPKC are required for the correct localization of Hippo (Hpo)/Ras associated factor (RASSF), while Crb regulates the levels and localization of Expanded (Ex), indicating that cell polarity determinants modify SWH pathway activity by distinct mechanisms.

In Drosophila, abnormal expression of apical-basal determinants can cause neoplastic phenotypes, including loss of cell polarity and overproliferation. However, the pathways through which apical-basal polarity determinants affect growth are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the apical determinant Crumbs (Crb) affects growth in Drosophila imaginal discs. Overexpression of Crb causes severe overproliferation, and we found that loss of Crb similarly results in overgrowth of imaginal discs. Crb gain and loss of function caused defects in Hippo signaling, a key signaling pathway that controls tissue growth in Drosophila and mammals. Manipulation of Crb levels caused the up-regulation of Hippo target genes, genetically interacted with known Hippo pathway components, and required Yorkie, a transcriptional coactivator that acts downstream in the Hippo pathway, for target gene induction and overgrowth. Interestingly, Crb regulates growth and cell polarity through different motifs in its intracellular domain. A juxtamembrane FERM domain-binding motif is responsible for growth regulation and induction of Hippo target gene expression, whereas Crb uses a PDZ-binding motif to form a complex with other polarity factors.

Activation of the core kinase cassette results in phosphorylation and inactivation of the progrowth transcriptional coactivator Yki, leading to increased apoptosis and reduced tissue growth. The mechanisms that prevent inappropriate Hpo activation remain unclear, and in particular, the identity of the phosphatase that antagonizes Hpo is unknown. Using combined proteomic and RNAi screening approaches, we identify the dSTRIPAK PP2A complex as a major regulator of Hpo signaling. dSTRIPAK depletion leads to increased Hpo activatory phosphorylation and repression of Yki target genes in vivo, suggesting this phosphatase complex prevents Hpo activation during development.","PMID":20797625,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ribeiro","initials":"PS","foreName":"Paulo S"},{"lastName":"Josué","initials":"F","foreName":"Filipe"},{"lastName":"Wepf","initials":"A","foreName":"Alexander"},{"lastName":"Wehr","initials":"MC","foreName":"Michael C"},{"lastName":"Rinner","initials":"O","foreName":"Oliver"},{"lastName":"Kelly","initials":"G","foreName":"Gavin"},{"lastName":"Tapon","initials":"N","foreName":"Nicolas"},{"lastName":"Gstaiger","initials":"M","foreName":"Matthias"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14847,"articleTitle":"Stressors, glucocorticoids and ovarian function in teleosts.","dateCreated":"2010-08-26","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1095-8649","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of fish biology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The re-examination is undertaken in light of recent advances in the understanding of the stress response itself, the mode of action of the hypothalamus-pituitary gland-ovarian (HPO) axis, the mechanisms of control of oestrogen-dependent hepatic vitellogenin (VtG) secretion and the apparent roles of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and CRH-related factors in the regulation of feeding activity. Many of the results of different studies, particularly whole-animal studies, are conflicting, and little is known as to whether the hormone acts directly on various components of the HPO axis or indirectly by virtue of redirection of energy resources away from ovarian growth to provide a source of metabolic resources for other organ systems involved in the physiological stress response. In vitro studies provide some new insights into the direct actions of glucocorticoid on hepatic VtG synthesis and ovarian follicle steroidogenesis, but even here, in some studies the cellular sites of action of these hormones is not altogether clear. The overview emphasizes the complexity of the stress response, the complexity of the regulation of glucocorticoid-dependent gene expression and the extensive interactive nature of the HPO with other hypothalamus-pituitary gland-peripheral endocrine gland axes, such as the thyroid (HPT), 'somatic' (GH-IGF) and interrenal tissue (HPI) axes.","PMID":20738701,"authors":[{"lastName":"Leatherland","initials":"JF","foreName":"J F"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Barkataki","initials":"S","foreName":"S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14907,"articleTitle":"Strategies of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthesis by Haloarcula sp.

After applying an ac field with relatively high intensity and frequency, it was shown that only COOH-SiNPs and CH(3)HPO(2)-SiNPs could be self-assembled on the microelectrodes by the DEP forces. The results indicated that the anionic group modification could obviously enhance the DEP self-assembly of SiNPs on the microelectrodes.

By using Rubpy dye doped in the core of the CH(3)HPO(2)-SiNPs, the assembly process was visualized in real time by inverse fluorescence microscopy. Precise control over the frequency of the applied ac field showed that the DEP forces can assemble CH(3)HPO(2)-SiNPs from aqueous suspensions into submicrowires, and it was found that the number of assembled submicrowires between the microelectrode gaps could be well controlled with reversibility.

Five days after implantation of enzymatically-dispersed HPO cells from a GFP-expressing transgenic line into the hemocoel of normal larvae, differentiation into plasmatocytes, granulocytes and oenocytoids, but not spherulocytes, was observed. When the HPO cells were cultured in vitro, plasmatocytes appeared rapidly, and oenocytoids possessing prophenol oxidase activity appeared several days later. HPO cells were also able to differentiate into a small number of granulocytes, but not into spherulocytes. When functionally mature plasmatocytes were cultured in vitro, oenocytoids were observed 10 days later. These results suggest that the hemocyte precursors in HPO first differentiate into plasmatocytes, which further change into oenocytoids.From these results, we propose that B. mori hemocytes can be divided into two major lineages, a granulocyte lineage and a plasmatocyte-oenocytoid lineage.

We report here that liver-specific deletion of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) tumor suppressor gene in the developing or adult mouse specifically yields a dramatic, progressive expansion of progenitor cells throughout the liver without affecting differentiated hepatocytes. All surviving mice eventually developed both cholangiocellular and hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that Nf2(-/-) progenitors can be a cell of origin for these tumors. Despite the suggested link between Nf2 and the Hpo/Wts/Yki signaling pathway in Drosophila, and recent studies linking the corresponding Mst/Lats/Yap pathway to mammalian liver tumorigenesis, our molecular studies suggest that Merlin is not a major regulator of YAP in liver progenitors, and that the overproliferation of Nf2(-/-) liver progenitors is instead driven by aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity. Indeed, pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR blocks the proliferation of Nf2(-/-) liver progenitors in vitro and in vivo, consistent with recent studies indicating that the Nf2-encoded protein Merlin can control the abundance and signaling of membrane receptors such as EGFR.

Thus, the objectives of this experiment were to determine if characteristics of temporal patterns of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) in postpartum, anovular, beef cows are influenced by acute exposure to bulls. The null hypotheses were that daily, temporal characteristics of cortisol and LH concentration patterns do not differ between cows exposed acutely to bulls or steers.Sixteen cows were assigned randomly 67 +/- 4 (+/- SE) after calving to be exposed to bulls (EB, n = 8) or steers (ES, n = 8) 5 h daily for 9 d (D 0 to 8). Blood samples were collected daily from each cow via jugular catheters at 15-min intervals for 6 h from 1000 to 1600 h each day. The 5-h exposure period began 1 h after the start of the intensive bleeding period. Characteristics of cortisol and LH concentration patterns (mean, baseline, pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, and pulse duration) were identified by PULSAR analyses.Mean cortisol concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) in cows in both treatments from D 0 to D 2. Thereafter, mean cortisol concentrations stabilized and did not differ (P > 0.10) between EB and ES cows. The decrease in mean cortisol concentrations in EB and ES cows from D 0 to D 2 was attributed to cows acclimatizing to intensive blood sampling and handling procedures. Consequently, analyses for characteristics of cortisol and LH concentration patterns included D 2 through 8 only. Cortisol mean and baseline concentrations, and pulse amplitude did not differ (P > 0.10) between EB and ES cows. However, cortisol pulse duration tended to be longer (P = 0.09) and pulse frequency was lower (P = 0.05) in EB than ES cows. LH pulse frequency was greater (P = 0.06) in EB than ES cows. All other characteristics of LH concentration patterns did not differ (P > 0.10) between EB and ES cows. Characteristics of cortisol concentration patterns were not related to characteristics of LH concentration patterns for ES cows (P > 0.10). However, as cortisol pulse amplitude increased, LH pulse amplitude decreased (b1 = -0.04; P < 0.05) for EB cows.In conclusion, exposing primiparous, postpartum, anovular, suckled cows to bulls for 5-h daily over a 9-d period did not alter mean concentrations of cortisol or LH compared to mean concentrations of cortisol and LH in cows exposed to steers. However, exposing cows to bull in this manner altered characteristics of temporal patterns of both LH and cortisol by increasing LH pulse frequency and decreasing cortisol pulse frequency. Interestingly, in cows exposed to bulls, as amplitude and frequency of cortisol pulses decreased, amplitudes of LH pulses increased and frequency of LH pulses tended to increase. Thus, the physiological mechanism of the biostimulatory effect of bulls may initially involve modification of the HPA axis and these changes may facilitate activation of the HPO axis and resumption of ovulatory cycles in postpartum, anovular, suckled cows.","PMID":20642864,"authors":[{"lastName":"Tauck","initials":"SA","foreName":"Shaun A"},{"lastName":"Olsen","initials":"JR","foreName":"Jesse R"},{"lastName":"Wilkinson","initials":"JR","foreName":"Jarrod R C"},{"lastName":"Wedlake","initials":"RJ","foreName":"Riley J"},{"lastName":"Davis","initials":"KC","foreName":"Kathleen C"},{"lastName":"Berardinelli","initials":"JG","foreName":"James G"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14802,"articleTitle":"Upstream regulation of the hippo size control pathway.","dateCreated":"2010-07-12","dateRevised":"2010-07-12","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0445","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

We found that cyt c forms polymers by successive domain swapping, where the C-terminal helix is displaced from its original position in the monomer and Met-heme coordination is perturbed significantly. In the crystal structures of dimeric and trimeric cyt c, the C-terminal helices are replaced by the corresponding domain of other cyt c molecules and Met80 is dissociated from the heme. The solution structures of dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric cyt c were linear based on small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, where the trimeric linear structure shifted toward the cyclic structure by addition of PEG and (NH(4))(2)HPO(4). The absorption and CD spectra of high-order oligomers (approximately 40 mer) were similar to those of dimeric and trimeric cyt c but different from those of monomeric cyt c. For dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric cyt c, the DeltaH of the oligomer dissociation to monomers was estimated to be about -20 kcal/mol per protomer unit, where Met-heme coordination appears to contribute largely to DeltaH. The present results suggest that cyt c polymerization occurs by successive domain swapping, which may be a common mechanism of protein polymerization.","PMID":20615990,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hirota","initials":"S","foreName":"Shun"},{"lastName":"Hattori","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yoko"},{"lastName":"Nagao","initials":"S","foreName":"Satoshi"},{"lastName":"Taketa","initials":"M","foreName":"Midori"},{"lastName":"Komori","initials":"H","foreName":"Hirofumi"},{"lastName":"Kamikubo","initials":"H","foreName":"Hironari"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Z","foreName":"Zhonghua"},{"lastName":"Takahashi","initials":"I","foreName":"Isao"},{"lastName":"Negi","initials":"S","foreName":"Shigeru"},{"lastName":"Sugiura","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yukio"},{"lastName":"Kataoka","initials":"M","foreName":"Mikio"},{"lastName":"Higuchi","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yoshiki"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14819,"articleTitle":"Dextran coatings for aggregation control of layer-by-layer assembled polyelectrolyte microcapsules.","dateCreated":"2010-07-29","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5827","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","isoAbbreviation":"Langmuir"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We propose dextran and dextran polyaldehyde (DPA) coatings for modification of layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled polyelectrolyte microcapsules which provide stability against aggregation in 0.75 M aqueous solutions of mono- and bivalent ions (Na(+), Cl(-), Ca(2+), HPO(4)(2-)). The microcapsules were prepared of three bilayers of poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and poly(allylamine) (PAH). Dextran and its derivatives were attached to amino-terminated surface of the microcapsules via three types of chemical bonds of subsequently increasing strength: (1) hydrogen bonds, (2) hydrolyzable covalent cross-links resulting from aldehydes and primary amines coupling, and (3) nonhydrolyzable covalent C-N single bonds of secondary amines. Attachment of the DPA materials via the latter two types of bonds resulted in strengthening the capsules' walls which preserved a fraction of the microcapsules from disintegration upon electrostatic swelling in 0.1 M NaOH. The non-disintegrated fraction of the DPA-coated microcapsules restored their initial size after pH was decreased back to neutral. The microcapsules coated with the original dextran immobilized via hydrogen bonds and the bare microcapsules were fully dissolved under the alkaline conditions. The preserved fraction of the microcapsules was higher for the DPA materials with higher contents of the aldehyde groups and after conversion of the hydrolyzable covalent cross-links to the nonhydrolyzable secondary amines via reduction with NaBH(4). The higher contents of the aldehyde groups and the reduction led to the lower limiting swelling degree of the DPA-coated microcapsules at alkaline pH. The proposed coatings can be used for colloid stabilization of polyelectrolyte microcapsules in aqueous medium, encapsulation of pH-insensitive macromolecules at the postpreparation stage, and pH-triggered release of encapsulated material.","PMID":20614898,"authors":[{"lastName":"Usov","initials":"D","foreName":"Denys"},{"lastName":"Sukhorukov","initials":"GB","foreName":"Gleb B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14830,"articleTitle":"Low-cost fermentation medium for alkaline protease production by Bacillus mojavensis A21 using hulled grain of wheat and sardinella peptone.","dateCreated":"2010-08-09","dateRevised":"2010-08-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"1347-4421","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of bioscience and bioengineering","isoAbbreviation":"J.

This process depends in part on the capacity of wing cells to recruit neighboring, non-wing cells into the wing primordium. Wing cells are defined by activity of the selector gene vestigial (vg) and recruitment entails the production of a vg-dependent \"feed-forward signal\" that acts together with morphogen to induce vg expression in neighboring non-wing cells. Here, we identify the protocadherins Fat (Ft) and Dachsous (Ds), the Warts-Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, and the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki, a YES associated protein, or YAP) as components of the feed-forward signaling mechanism, and we show how this mechanism promotes wing growth in response to Wg. We find that vg generates the feed-forward signal by creating a steep differential in Ft-Ds signaling between wing and non-wing cells. This differential down-regulates Warts-Hippo pathway activity in non-wing cells, leading to a burst of Yki activity and the induction of vg in response to Wg.

These additional RASSF members are divergent and structurally distinct from RASSF1-6, containing an N-terminal RA domain and lacking the Sav/RASSF/Hpo (SARAH) domain. Here, we show that RASSF8 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the murine embryo and in normal human adult tissues. Functionally, RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF8 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and enhanced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Furthermore, EdU staining of RASSF8-depleted cells showed growth suppression in a manner dependent on contact inhibition. We show that endogenous RASSF8 is not only found in the nucleus, but is also membrane associated at sites of cell-cell adhesion, co-localizing with the adherens junction (AJ) component beta-catenin and binding to E-cadherin. Following RASSF8 depletion in two different lung cancer cell lines using alternative small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences, we show that AJs are destabilized and E-cadherin is lost from the cell membrane. The AJ components beta-catenin and p65 are also lost from sites of cell-cell contact and are relocalized to the nucleus with a concomitant increase in beta-catenin-dependent and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent signaling following RASSF8 depletion. RASSF8 may also be required to maintain actin -cytoskeletal organization since immunofluorescence analysis shows a striking disorganization of the actin- cytoskeleton following RASSF8 depletion.

At the core of the Hippo pathway is a kinase cascade extending from the Hippo (Hpo) tumor suppressor to the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein. The Hippo kinase cascade, in turn, is regulated by apical membrane-associated proteins such as the FERM domain proteins Merlin and Expanded (Ex), and the WW- and C2-domain protein Kibra. How these apical proteins are themselves regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb), a determinant of epithelial apical-basal polarity in Drosophila embryos, as an upstream component of the Hippo pathway in imaginal disk growth control. Loss of Crb leads to tissue overgrowth and target gene expression characteristic of defective Hippo signaling. Crb directly binds to Ex through its juxtamembrane FERM-binding motif (FBM). Loss of Crb or mutation of its FBM leads to mislocalization of Ex to basolateral domain of imaginal disk epithelial cells. These results shed light on the mechanism of Ex regulation and provide a molecular link between apical-basal polarity and tissue growth. Furthermore, our studies implicate Crb as a putative cell surface receptor for Hippo signaling by uncovering a transmembrane protein that directly binds to an apical component of the Hippo pathway.","PMID":20498073,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ling","initials":"C","foreName":"Chen"},{"lastName":"Zheng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yonggang"},{"lastName":"Yin","initials":"F","foreName":"Feng"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"J","foreName":"Jianzhong"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"J","foreName":"Juan"},{"lastName":"Hong","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yang"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"S","foreName":"Shian"},{"lastName":"Pan","initials":"D","foreName":"Duojia"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14816,"articleTitle":"Incidence of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy associated with primary lung cancer.","dateCreated":"2010-07-26","dateRevised":"2010-07-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"1440-1843","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)","isoAbbreviation":"Respirology"},"articleDate":"2010-05-20","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Although the association of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) with lung cancer was investigated in the 1960s, the recent incidence of clinically apparent HPO is not known.

Ten (0.8%) patients had clubbed fingers and joint pain and were eventually confirmed as having HPO.

All these enzymes share a common feature in that they de-N-acetylate the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety of their substrates. The bc1534 gene has previously been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified and its 3D structure determined. In this study, the bc3461 gene from B. cereus ATCC14579 was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzymes BC1534 (EC 3.5.1.-) and BC3461 were biochemically characterized. The enzymes have different molecular masses, pH and temperature optima and broad substrate specificity, de-N-acetylating GlcNAc and N-acetylchito-oligomers (GlcNAc(2), GlcNAc(3) and GlcNAc(4)), as well as GlcNAc-1P, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1 phosphate; GlcNAc-6P, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6 phosphate; GalNAc, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine; ManNAc, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine 5'-diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.

The measurement of datasets around the K edges of both Ga and Zn, as well as two reference datasets away from each absorption edge, was utilized to selectively exploit dispersive differences of each metal atom type in turn, which allowed the major sites of Zn incorporation to be identified as the metal 1 and 3 sites, M1 and M3. The preferential substitution of Zn at these sites probably arises because they are located in double four-ring (D4R) building units which can relax to accommodate the incorporation of hetero atoms. As the crystal is non-centrosymmetric, with space group P2(1)2(1)2, it was also possible to use anomalous differences to corroborate the results obtained from the dispersive differences. These results were obtained firstly from difference Fourier maps, calculated using a phase set from the refined structure from data measured at the Zr K edge. Also, refined dispersive and anomalous occupancies, on an absolute scale, could be obtained using the program MLPHARE, allowing estimates for the Zn incorporation of approximately 22 and 18 at. % at the M1 and M3 sites to be obtained.

After cultivation for 5 days in the improved medium, intact feather was completely degraded. Feather degradation resulted in free -SH group, soluble protein and amino acids production. The concentration of free -SH group in the culture medium was 15.5 ± 0.2 μM at 4 days. Nineteen amino acids including all essential amino acids were produced in the culture medium; the concentration of total amino acid produced was 3360.4 μM.

Taken together, the three techniques seem to indicate that the dissolved oxygen tension during cell growth or acclimation can noticeably influence the expression of cell surface molecules and the measurable cell surface charge, though in a strain-dependent fashion.","PMID":20438073,"authors":[{"lastName":"Castro","initials":"FD","foreName":"Felipe D"},{"lastName":"Sedman","initials":"J","foreName":"Jacqueline"},{"lastName":"Ismail","initials":"AA","foreName":"Ashraf A"},{"lastName":"Asadishad","initials":"B","foreName":"Bahareh"},{"lastName":"Tufenkji","initials":"N","foreName":"Nathalie"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14781,"articleTitle":"Semi-preparative high-speed counter-current chromatography separation of alkaloids from embryo of the seed of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn by pH-gradient elution.","dateCreated":"2010-06-21","dateRevised":"2010-06-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1615-9314","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of separation science","isoAbbreviation":"J Sep Sci"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A new high-speed counter-current chromatography method for semi-preparative separation and purification of alkaloids from embryo of the seed of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn was developed by using pH-gradient elution mode.

The importance of pRB is usually explained by its ability to promote cell cycle exit. Here, we demonstrate that, independently of cell cycle exit control, in cooperation with the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, pRB functions to maintain the terminally differentiated state. We show that mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway, wts or hpo, trigger widespread dedifferentiation of rbf mutant cells in the Drosophila eye. Initially, rbf wts or rbf hpo double mutant cells are morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts as they properly differentiate into photoreceptors, form axonal projections, and express late neuronal markers. However, the double mutant cells cannot maintain their neuronal identity, dedifferentiate, and thus become uncommitted eye specific cells. Surprisingly, this dedifferentiation is fully independent of cell cycle exit defects and occurs even when inappropriate proliferation is fully blocked by a de2f1 mutation. Thus, our results reveal the novel involvement of the pRB pathway during the maintenance of a differentiated state and suggest that terminally differentiated Rb mutant cells are intrinsically prone to dedifferentiation, can be converted to progenitor cells, and thus contribute to cancer advancement.","PMID":20421993,"authors":[{"lastName":"Nicolay","initials":"BN","foreName":"Brandon N"},{"lastName":"Bayarmagnai","initials":"B","foreName":"Battuya"},{"lastName":"Moon","initials":"NS","foreName":"Nam Sung"},{"lastName":"Benevolenskaya","initials":"EV","foreName":"Elizaveta V"},{"lastName":"Frolov","initials":"MV","foreName":"Maxim V"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15555,"articleTitle":"Animal performance and fatty acid composition of lambs fed with different vegetable oils.","dateCreated":"2012-08-03","dateRevised":"2012-08-03","publication":{"issnNumber":"0309-1740","issnType":"Print","title":"Meat science","isoAbbreviation":"Meat Sci."},"articleDate":"2009-06-28","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Twenty-seven lambs were used to investigate the effects of the inclusion of 4% hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) or sunflower oil (SFO) in the concentrate on animal performance, carcass and meat quality and fat characteristics and fatty acid composition.

TAZ inhibits the CK1delta/epsilon-mediated phosphorylation of DVL, thereby inhibiting Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling. Abrogation of TAZ levels or Hippo signaling enhances Wnt3A-stimulated DVL phosphorylation, nuclear beta-Catenin, and Wnt target gene expression. Mice lacking Taz develop polycystic kidneys with enhanced cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-Catenin. Moreover, in Drosophila, Hippo signaling modulates Wg target gene expression.

In addition, our newly proposed method involving a quadratic polynomial calibration curve was also assessed. The µ-maps generated for both phantom and clinical studies were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. A cylindrical polyethylene phantom containing different concentrations of K(2)HPO(4) in water was scanned and the µ-maps calculated from the corresponding CT images using the above-referenced energy-mapping methods. The CT images of five whole-body data sets acquired on a GE Discovery LS PET/CT scanner were employed to generate µ-maps using different energy-mapping approaches that were compared with the µ-maps generated at 511 keV using (68)Ge/(68)Ga rod sources. In another experiment, the evaluation was performed on PET images of a clinical study corrected for attenuation using µ-maps generated using the above described methods. The evaluation was performed for three different tissue types, namely, soft tissue, lung, and bone.All energy-mapping methods yielded almost similar results for soft tissues.

However, the scaling method produced the largest difference (16%) for bone tissues. For lung tissues, the segmentation method produced the largest difference (14.9%). The results for reconstructed PET images followed a similar trend. For soft tissues, all energy-mapping methods yield results in nearly the same range. However, in bone tissues, the scaling method resulted in considerable bias in the µ-maps and the reconstructed PET images. The segmentation method also produced noticeable bias especially in regions with variable densities such as the lung, since a single µ is assigned to the lungs. Apart from the aforementioned case, despite small differences in the generated µ-maps, the use of different energy-mapping methods does not affect, to a visible or measurable extent, the reconstructed PET images.","PMID":20387123,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ay","initials":"MR","foreName":"Mohammad R"},{"lastName":"Shirmohammad","initials":"M","foreName":"Maryam"},{"lastName":"Sarkar","initials":"S","foreName":"Saeed"},{"lastName":"Rahmim","initials":"A","foreName":"Arman"},{"lastName":"Zaidi","initials":"H","foreName":"Habib"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14728,"articleTitle":"Chemical transformations during aging of zerovalent iron nanoparticles in the presence of common groundwater dissolved constituents.","dateCreated":"2010-04-29","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0013-936X","issnType":"Print","title":"Environmental science & technology","isoAbbreviation":"Environ.

NZVI was exposed to 10 mN of various common groundwater anions (Cl(-), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-), HPO(4)(2-), and HCO(3)(-)) or to dissolved oxygen (saturated, approximately 9 mg/L). Fresh and exposed NZVI samples, along with Fe-oxide model compounds, were then analyzed using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to yield both relative oxidation state, using the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and quantitative speciation information regarding the types and proportions of mineral species present, from analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Over 1 month of aging the dissolved anions inhibited the oxidation of the NZVI to varying degrees. Aging for 6 months, however, resulted in average oxidation states that were similar to each other regardless of the anion used, except for nitrate. Nitrate passivated the NZVI surface such that even after 6 months of aging the particles retained nearly the same mineral and Fe(0) content as fresh NZVI. Linear least-squares combination fitting (LCF) of the EXAFS spectra for 1 month-aged samples indicated that the oxidized particles remain predominantly a binary phase system containing Fe(0) and Fe(3)O(4), while the 6 month aged samples contained additional mineral phases such as vivianite (Fe(3)(PO(4))(2).8H(2)O) and iron sulfate species, possibly schwertmannite (Fe(3+)(16)O(16)(OH,SO(4))(12-13).10-12H(2)O). The presence of these additional mineral species was confirmed using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD). NZVI exposed to water saturated with dissolved oxygen showed a rapid (<24 h) loss of Fe(0) and evolved both magnetite and maghemite (gamma-Fe(2)O(3)) within the oxide layer. These findings have implications toward the eventual fate, transport, and toxicity of NZVI used for groundwater remediation.","PMID":20380376,"authors":[{"lastName":"Reinsch","initials":"BC","foreName":"Brian C"},{"lastName":"Forsberg","initials":"B","foreName":"Brady"},{"lastName":"Penn","initials":"RL","foreName":"R Lee"},{"lastName":"Kim","initials":"CS","foreName":"Christopher S"},{"lastName":"Lowry","initials":"GV","foreName":"Gregory V"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15111,"articleTitle":"YAP1--friend and foe.","dateCreated":"2011-05-17","dateRevised":"2013-04-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"1551-4005","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","isoAbbreviation":"Cell Cycle"},"articleDate":"2010-04-15","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"","PMID":20372091,"authors":[{"lastName":"Yee","initials":"KS","foreName":"Karen S"},{"lastName":"O'Neill","initials":"E","foreName":"Eric"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14743,"articleTitle":"Degradation efficiencies of azo dye Acid Orange 7 by the interaction of heat, UV and anions with common oxidants: persulfate, peroxymonosulfate and hydrogen peroxide.","dateCreated":"2010-05-14","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3336","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of hazardous materials","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Here we investigate how these cell polarity regulators control proliferation and survival.We report that depletion of lgl in eye epithelial tissue, where polarity is maintained, results in upregulation of targets of the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) tumor suppressor pathway. Consistent with this, the SWH pathway transcriptional coactivator Yorkie is hyperactivated in Lgl-deficient tissue and is rate limiting for lgl(-) phenotypes. Overexpression of the apical polarity regulators Crumbs or aPKC also leads to ectopic expression of SWH pathway targets without affecting polarity. We show that Lgl depletion or aPKC overexpression results in comislocalization of Hippo and Ras-associated domain family protein (RASSF), consistent with RASSF's ability to block Hippo activation by Salvador. In contrast, Crumbs overexpression leads to mislocalization of Expanded away from the apical cortex, which is predicted to deregulate the pathway.Collectively, our data reveal that the cell polarity regulators Lgl, aPKC, and Crumbs regulate the SWH pathway by two distinct pathways: Lgl acts antagonistically to aPKC to regulate Hippo and RASSF localization, whereas Crumbs regulates Expanded localization.

Reciprocally, loss of crb elevates Ex levels, although this excess Ex does not concentrate to its normal location at apical junctions. The Ex-regulatory domain of Crb maps to the juxtamembrane FERM-binding motif (JM), a cytoskeletal interaction domain distinct from the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) through which Crb binds polarity factors. Expression of Crb-JM drives Yki activity and organ growth with little effect on tissue architecture, while Crb-PBM reciprocally produces tissue architectural defects without significant effect on Yki activity.These studies identify Crb as a novel SWH regulator via JM-dependent effects on Ex levels and localization and suggest that discrete domains within Crb may allow it to integrate junctional polarity signals with a conserved growth pathway.","PMID":20362445,"authors":[{"lastName":"Robinson","initials":"BS","foreName":"Brian S"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"J","foreName":"Juang"},{"lastName":"Hong","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yang"},{"lastName":"Moberg","initials":"KH","foreName":"Kenneth H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14732,"articleTitle":"The use of MSSV pyrolysis to assist the molecular characterisation of aquatic natural organic matter.","dateCreated":"2010-05-03","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-2448","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Water research","isoAbbreviation":"Water Res."},"articleDate":"2010-03-04","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Microscale sealed vessel pyrolysis (MSSVpy) with online gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used with several other established and complementary analytical methods to robustly characterize the structure of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) and to practically assess the analytical value of MSSVpy.

The reservoir has moderate dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 5mgL(-1)) levels and is impacted by algae which periodically occur in bloom proportions. The hydrophobic (HPO; 65% initial DOC) and transphilic (TPI; 12%) fractions showed H/C values >1, low UV(abs) and low aryl-C measured by NMR which are all indicative of low aromaticity. MSSVpy produced distinctly higher product concentrations than traditional flash pyrolysis and the molecular profile of the HPO and TPI fractions revealed by MSSVpy was correlated with the other analytical data to help establish their structural relevance. Prolific distributions of alkyl substituted aromatic (e.g., benzenes, naphthalenes) and hydroaromatic (e.g., tetralins) products detected in the HPO fraction were attributed to the aromatisation of terpanes and other aliphatic compounds from algal, and possibly also plant sources. Alkyl phenols also detected in HPO in high abundance, are probably from algal biopolymers, but may also reflect a contribution from non-methoxylated lignin units of catchment grasses. There was no analytical evidence of the dihydroxy or methoxy aromatic structures typical of wood lignin or tannin. N-organic pyrolysates (e.g., alkyl pyrroles, pyridines, indoles) of diagenetically altered proteins were concentrated in the TPI fraction. The quantitative importance of the N-organic moiety of the TPI fraction was corroborated by a low C/N ratio and distinctive amide and amine signals detected by (13)C NMR and FTIR.

Thus, we turned to Drosophila, where a single gene, CG11063 or djub, exists. Drosophila lacking the djub gene or depleted of dJub by RNA interference identify djub as an essential gene for development and a novel regulator of epithelial organ size as a component of the conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway, which has been implicated in both tissue size control and cancer development. djub-deficient tissues were small and had decreased cell numbers as a result of increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, due to downregulation of DIAP1 and cyclin E. This phenocopies tissues deficient for Yorkie (Yki), the downstream target of the Hippo pathway. djub genetically interacts with the Hippo pathway, and epistasis suggests that djub lies downstream of hpo.

Loss of function mutations in the merlin tumor suppressor underlie neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a familial autosomal dominant cancer syndrome. Studies of Drosophila suggest that Hippo (hpo) is required for inhibition of cell proliferation mediated by dMer, the orthologue of human merlin. Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-2 (Mst2) is a mammalian Hpo orthologue, and numerous studies implicate Mst2 as a tumor suppressor. Mst2 is negatively regulated by the proto-oncoprotein Raf-1 in a manner independent of the kinase activity of Raf-1. We sought to determine whether, in mammalian cells, merlin could positively regulate Mst2. We also sought to determine whether Mst2, in addition to being negatively regulated by Raf-1, might itself reciprocally regulate Raf-1. In contrast to findings from Drosophila, we find no evidence that mammalian merlin positively regulates mammalian Mst2. Instead, surprisingly, RNA interference silencing of Mst2 leads to elevated inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-259 and impaired Raf-1 kinase activity. Consequent to this, ERK pathway activation and cell proliferation are attenuated. Phosphatase-2A (PP2A) dephosphorylates Raf-1 Ser-259 in response to mitogens. Interestingly RNA interference silencing of Mst2 triggers a striking proteasome-dependent decrease in the levels of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2A-C). A similar effect is achieved upon silencing of large tumor suppressor (LATS)-1 and LATS2, direct substrates of Mst2. Our studies reveal a more complex role for Mst2 than previously thought. The Mst2 --> LATS1/2 pathway, by maintaining PP2A-C levels, may, in some situations, positively affect mitogenic signaling.","PMID":20212043,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kilili","initials":"GK","foreName":"Geoffrey K"},{"lastName":"Kyriakis","initials":"JM","foreName":"John M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14676,"articleTitle":"Production of 1,3-dihydroxyacetone from glycerol by Gluconobacter oxydans ZJB09112.","dateCreated":"2010-03-08","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1017-7825","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of microbiology and biotechnology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

In the first stage, 16 media ingredients were screened for the ones that have the most positive influence on the SL production. The sixteen ingredients that were chosen are five different carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, glycerol, lactose, and sucrose), five different nitrogen sources (malt extract, peptone extract, soytone, urea, and yeast extract), two lipid sources (mineral oil and oleic acid), two phosphorus sources (K(2)HPO(4) and KH(2)PO(4)), MgSO(4), and CaCl(2). Multiple regression analysis and centroid effect analysis were carried out to find the sugar, lipid, nitrogen source, phosphorus source, and metals having the most positive influence. Sucrose, malt extract, oleic acid, K(2)HPO(4), and CaCl(2) were selected for the second stage of experiments. An augmented simplex centroid design for five ingredients requiring 16 experiments was used for the optimization stage. This produced a quadratic model developed to help understand the interaction amongst the ingredients and find the optimal media concentrations.

The salts used were K(2)HPO(4), KCl, KBr, KI, KNO(3), and KSCN, present at an initial concentration of 10 mM within an aqueous microdroplet containing K(2)SO(4) at an initial concentration of 287 mM. Supersaturation and subsequent crystallization were isothermally induced by droplet dissolution into the dehydrating decanol phase. The K(2)SO(4) solute crystallization behavior was studied by measurement of the calculated concentration of the solute in the microdroplet at the onset of crystallization, i.e., at the first perceptible microscopic appearance of a solid phase, and by crystal habit. Certain salts, e.g., K(2)HPO(4), had almost no influence on the templating ability of ODA, while the ability of ODA to template nucleation and direct the formation of regular crystal habit of K(2)SO(4) became appreciably disrupted in the presence of more chaotropic anions, such as SCN(-) or NO(3)(-). The propensity for anions to disrupt crystal templating was clearly seen to follow a Hofmeister trend. For crystallization events induced in the absence of ODA, however, these added salts had no influence on the outcome of the events. Microdroplets bounded by an ODA monolayer were also found to undergo droplet shrinkage into the surrounding dehydrating phase at a rate which generally depended upon the nature of the anion in the droplet, with chaotropic anions having an apparent effect of promoting shrinkage. Our findings suggest that the packing or ordering of an ODA monolayer at a liquid-liquid interface is strongly influenced by an interaction between anions in the aqueous phase and the surfactant monolayer at the liquid-liquid interface, which is manifested in its effect upon the crystal templating behavior.

First, the HPO(4)(2)-containing solution was added drop-wise into the Ca(2+)-containing solution while the molar ratio of Ca/P was adjusted at 1.67. The HAp precursor was then treated hydrothermally at 200 degrees C for 60h. The resulting powder was characterized using XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, and EDXA. The synthesized HAp nanorods were added to an experimental one-bottle dentin adhesive followed by the characterization of the filled adhesive. The diametral tensile strength, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and the microshear bond strength to the dentin of human premolars of seven adhesive systems containing different nanorod contents were evaluated. The distribution of the filler was determined using EDX-mapping. The depth of cure was also evaluated using scraping technique. Moreover, after microshear testing, the fracture cross-section was observed using SEM to determine the mode of failure involved. The colloidal stability was studied using a separation analyzer and also zeta potential measurement. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test.The results confirmed the high purity, high crystallinity, and high aspect ratio of synthesized HAp nanorods. The diametral tensile strength of nanorod containing adhesive system appeared to increase when 0.2-0.5wt.% HAp nanorods were incorporated (p<0.05). A similar trend was observed in the flexural test providing higher flexural strength at filler contents of 0.2-0.5wt.% while flexural modulus remained unchanged. The highest microshear bond strength was also obtained at 0.2wt.% filler content (p<0.05). The improved properties of the new adhesive system might be due to the high crystallinity and high aspect ratio of the nanorods. SEM observation of debonded surfaces revealed that most specimens showed an adhesive failure from the adhesive-dentin interface. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping confirmed the uniform distribution of nanorods in the adhesive matrix. The colloidal stability studies indicated that synthesized hydroxyapatite nanorods have high colloidal stability in the dental adhesive solution. Indeed, the nanorods are well dispersed and protected from aggregation by their high surface charge confirmed by zeta potential measurement.Hydroxyapatite-based composites have shown promising bioactivity.

For example, eye tissue lacking the core SWH pathway components salvador, warts or hippo is highly overgrown and resistant to developmental apoptosis, whereas tissue lacking fat or expanded is not.

Fat and Expanded do possess Yorkie-repressive activity in the pupal eye, but loss of fat or expanded at this stage of development can be compensated for by Merlin. Fat appears to repress Yorkie independently of Dachs in the pupal eye, which would contrast with the mode of action of Fat during larval development. Fat is more likely to restrict Yorkie activity in the pupal eye together with Expanded, given that pupal eye tissue lacking both these genes resembles that of tissue lacking either gene.

Here we investigated whether mammals also require the Hpo pathway to control organ size and adult tissue homeostasis. We found that Mst1 and Mst2, the two mouse homologs of the Drosophila Hpo, control the sizes of some, but not all organs, in mice, and Mst1 and Mst2 act as tumor suppressors by restricting cell proliferation and survival. We show that Mst1 and Mst2 play redundant roles, and removal of both resulted in early lethality in mouse embryos. Importantly, tumors developed in the liver with a substantial increase of the stem/progenitor cells by 6 months after removing Mst1 and Mst2 postnatally. We show that Mst1 and Mst2 were required in vivo to control Yap phosphorylation and activity. Interestingly, apoptosis induced by TNFalpha was blocked in the Mst1 and Mst2 double-mutant cells both in vivo and in vitro.

The optimum capillary electrophoresis (CE) conditions for the background electrolyte were established with the aid of Raman spectroscopy and experiments of a 3(2) factorial design. After response factor (R(F)) calculations, the CE method was applied to total trans fatty acid (TTFA) analysis in a hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF) sample, and compared with the American Oil Chemists' Society (AOCS) official method by gas chromatography (GC). The methods were compared with an independent sample t test, and no significant difference was found between CE and GC methods within the 95% confidence interval for six genuine replicates of TTFA analysis (p-value > 0.05). The CE method was applied to TTFA analysis in a spreadable cheese sample. Satisfactory results were obtained, indicating that the optimized methodology can be used for trans fatty acid determination for these samples.","PMID":20067270,"authors":[{"lastName":"De Castro","initials":"PM","foreName":"Patrícia Mendonça"},{"lastName":"Barra","initials":"MM","foreName":"Marcelo Macedo"},{"lastName":"Costa Ribeiro","initials":"MC","foreName":"Mauro Carlos"},{"lastName":"Aued-Pimentel","initials":"S","foreName":"Sabria"},{"lastName":"Da Silva","initials":"SA","foreName":"Simone Alves"},{"lastName":"De Oliveira","initials":"MA","foreName":"Marcone Augusto Leal"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14672,"articleTitle":"Channel-like characteristics of the low-affinity barley phosphate transporter PHT1;6 when expressed in Xenopus oocytes.","dateCreated":"2010-03-04","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1532-2548","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Plant physiology","isoAbbreviation":"Plant Physiol."},"articleDate":"2010-01-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Remobilization of inorganic phosphate (P(i)) within a plant is critical for sustaining growth and seed production under external P(i) fluctuation.

Upon short irradiation with UV light, the polymer layer cross links and becomes firmly adhered to the glassy carbon electrodes. If glucose oxidase is mixed into the polymer solution prior to coating, then glucose-oxidizing electrodes with very high catalytic current responses are obtained. The influence of multivalent ions and proteins on the performance of the electrocatalytic films is studied. It is found that the interaction between bivalent HPO(4)(2-) and the oxidized redox moieties can shorten the lifetime of the redox electrodes significantly whereas the same electrodes are quite stable in the presence of monovalent ions and the reduced form of the mediator. Coating a thin, covalently attached poly(dimethylacrylamide) protective layer onto the redox polymer networks can greatly reduce the adsorption of proteins onto the surfaces and improve the long-term stability of the electrodes in physiological environments.

The interpretation of results was based on the HA surface and oleate solution chemistry, and on some floatability tests. HA, with different positive and negative surface sites formed depending on its solubility and pH, had a negative zeta potential over the whole pH range. This mineral is not naturally floatable (flotation recovery, 5%<R<18%). The oleate ions (Ol(-)), present in a very low concentration in an acidic medium (pH from 4.8 to 6), chemisorb individually on HA surface centers [triple bond]Ca(+), [triple bond]HPO(4)Ca(+), and [triple bond]OH(2)(+), increasing the negative zeta potential of the mineral. Within the pH range from 7 to 9, the dominant oleate species Ol(-) ion and ion-molecule complex, H(Ol)(2)(-), adsorbed on HA by head groups toward the solid and associated due to chain-chain interaction in hemimicelles, made the HA surface with zeta potential about -22/-23 mV, and more floatable (R=80-100%) than in 4<pH<7 (R=15-35%) or in pH>9.3. The HA surface is less negatively charged in calcite supernatant than in water from pH 6.6 to 9.2 due to the adsorption on HA negative surface active centers ([triple bond]HPO(4)(-) and [triple bond]PO(4)(2-)) of the Ca(2+), and CaOH(+) ions (present in the calcite supernatant), producing more surface sites [triple bond]HPO(4)Ca(+), [triple bond]PO(4)Ca, [triple bond]HPO(4)CaOH, and [triple bond]PO(4)(-) CaOH, and new centers [triple bond]HPO(4)CaHCO(3) and [triple bond]PO(4)(-) CaHCO(3). In the presence of 1x10(-3) mol L(-1) CaCl(2), the HA sample has positive zeta potential, the same as calcite from the same deposit, up to IEP at pH 11.25. Carbonate ions (1x10(-3) mol L(-1) Na(2)CO(3)) do not affect the HA zeta potential. However, a possible process can be the ion-exchange reaction between bicarbonate (or carbonate) and some anion from the surface sites formed on HA.

Calcite supernatant does not influence natural floatability of the mineral. However, calcite supernatant depresses the hydroxyapatite flotation in the presence of 1x10(-4) mol L(-1) Na-oleate (pH 9, R approximately 50%), a likely result of the weak chemisorption due to the steric effect of heterogeneous HA surface formed in calcite supernatant, Ca(Ol)(2) and Ca[H(Ol)(2)(-)](2) surface and bulk precipitations.","PMID":20018290,"authors":[{"lastName":"Vucinić","initials":"DR","foreName":"Dusica R"},{"lastName":"Radulović","initials":"DS","foreName":"Dragan S"},{"lastName":"Deusić","initials":"SD","foreName":"Slaven D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14595,"articleTitle":"A green and sensitive method to determine phenols in water and wastewater samples using an aqueous two-phase system.","dateCreated":"2009-12-17","dateRevised":"2009-12-17","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3573","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Talanta","isoAbbreviation":"Talanta"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A greener and more sensitive spectrophotometric procedure has been developed for the determination of phenol and o-cresol that exploits an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) using a liquid-liquid extraction technique.

The quality of disease networks is heavily dependent on the amount and quality of phenotype information in phenotype databases of human genetic diseases. We explored which aspects of phenotype database architecture and content best reflect the underlying biology of disease. We used the OMIM-based HPO, Orphanet, and POSSUM phenotype databases for this purpose and devised a biological coherence score based on the sharing of gene ontology annotation to investigate the degree to which phenotype similarity in these databases reflects related pathobiology. Our analyses support the notion that a fine-grained phenotype ontology enhances the accuracy of phenome representation. In addition, we find that the OMIM database that is most used by the human genetics community is heavily underannotated. We show that this problem can easily be overcome by simply adding data available in the POSSUM database to improve OMIM phenotype representations in the HPO. Also, we find that the use of feature frequency estimates--currently implemented only in the Orphanet database--significantly improves the quality of the phenome representation. Our data suggest that there is much to be gained by improving human phenome databases and that some of the measures needed to achieve this are relatively easy to implement. More generally, we propose that curation and more systematic annotation of human phenome databases can greatly improve the power of the phenotype for genetic disease analysis.","PMID":20004759,"authors":[{"lastName":"Oti","initials":"M","foreName":"Martin"},{"lastName":"Huynen","initials":"MA","foreName":"Martijn A"},{"lastName":"Brunner","initials":"HG","foreName":"Han G"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14585,"articleTitle":"Entity/quality-based logical definitions for the human skeletal phenome using PATO.","dateCreated":"2009-12-07","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1557-170X","issnType":"Print","title":"Conference proceedings : ...

For every tonne of alumina, about 2 tonnes of highly alkaline and highly saline bauxite-processing residue are produced. In Western Australia, Alcoa World Alumina, Australia (Alcoa) produces approximately 15 MT of residue annually from its refineries (Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup). The bauxite-processing residue sand (BRS) fraction represents the primary material for rehabilitating Alcoa's residue disposal areas (RDAs). However, the inherently hostile characteristics (high alkalinity, high salinity and poor nutrient availability) of BRS pose severe limitations for establishing sustainable plant cover systems. Alcoa currently applies 2.7 t ha(-1) of di-ammonium phosphate ((NH(4))(2)HPO(4); DAP)-based fertiliser as a part of rehabilitation of the outer residue sand embankments of its RDAs. Limited information on the behaviour of the dominant components of this inorganic fertiliser in highly alkaline BRS is currently available, despite the known effects of pH on ammonium (NH(4)) and phosphorus (P) behaviour. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of pH on NH(3) volatilisation and residual nitrogen (N) in BRS following DAP applications.The sponge-trapping and KCl-extraction method was used for determining NH(3) volatilisation from surface-applied DAP in samples of BRS collected from each of Alcoa's three Western Australia Refineries (Kwinana, Pinjarra, Wagerup) under various pH conditions (pH 4, 7, 9 and 11). Following cessation of volatilisation, the residual N was extracted from BRS using 2 M KCl and concentrations of NH (4) (+) -N and NO (3) (-) -N were determined by flow injection analysis.The quantities of NH(3) volatilised increased dramatically as the pH increased from 4 to 11. Much of the N lost as NH(3) (up to 95.2%) occurred within a short period (24 h to 7 days), particularly for the pH 9 and 11 treatments. Concentrations of residual NH (4) (+) -N recovered in DAP-treated BRS at the end of the experiment decreased with increasing pH. This finding was consistent with increasing loss of N via volatilisation as pH increased. The concentration of NO (3) (-) -N was very low due to no nitrification in BRS.The pH was a key driver for NH(3) volatilisation from DAP-treated BRS and primarily controlled N dynamics in BRS. Results indicate that NH(4) not adsorbed by BRS was highly susceptible to volatilisation. The likely lack of nitrifying bacteria did not allow conversion of ammonium to nitrate, thereby further exacerbating the potential for loss via volatilisationIt was demonstrated that the pH is the key factor controlling the loss of inorganic N from BRS. Although volatilisation was considerably lower at pH 4, achieving this pH reduction in the field is not possible at present. Findings from this study highlight the need to better understand which forms of N fertiliser are most suitable for use in highly alkaline BRS.Although pH reduction is the most likely means of stopping NH(3) volatilisation in BRS, it is economically and operationally unfeasible to add sufficient acidity for adequately lowering pH in the BRS for revegetation. More attention on forms of fertilisers more suitable to highly alkaline, microbially inert soil conditions appears to be warranted.","PMID":19937393,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"CR","foreName":"C R"},{"lastName":"Phillips","initials":"IR","foreName":"I R"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"LL","foreName":"L L"},{"lastName":"Xu","initials":"ZH","foreName":"Z H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14579,"articleTitle":"YAP-dependent induction of amphiregulin identifies a non-cell-autonomous component of the Hippo pathway.","dateCreated":"2009-12-01","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1476-4679","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Nature cell biology","isoAbbreviation":"Nat.

The pivotal effector of this pathway is YAP (yes-associated protein), a transcriptional co-activator amplified in mouse and human cancers, where it promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant transformation. So far, studies of YAP target genes have focused on cell-autonomous mediators; here we show that YAP-expressing MCF10A breast epithelial cells enhance the proliferation of neighbouring untransfected cells, implicating a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We identify the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin (AREG) as a transcriptional target of YAP, whose induction contributes to YAP-mediated cell proliferation and migration, but not EMT. Knockdown of AREG or addition of an EGFR kinase inhibitor abrogates the proliferative effects of YAP expression. Suppression of the negative YAP regulators LATS1 and 2 (large tumour suppressor 1 and 2) is sufficient to induce AREG expression, consistent with physiological regulation of AREG by the Hippo pathway. Genetic interaction between the Drosophila YAP orthologue Yorkie and Egfr signalling components supports the link between these two highly conserved signalling pathways. Thus, YAP-dependent secretion of AREG indicates that activation of EGFR signalling is an important non-cell-autonomous effector of the Hippo pathway, which has implications for the regulation of both physiological and malignant cell proliferation.","PMID":19935651,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jianmin"},{"lastName":"Ji","initials":"JY","foreName":"Jun-Yuan"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"M","foreName":"Min"},{"lastName":"Overholtzer","initials":"M","foreName":"Michael"},{"lastName":"Smolen","initials":"GA","foreName":"Gromoslaw A"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"R","foreName":"Rebecca"},{"lastName":"Brugge","initials":"JS","foreName":"Joan S"},{"lastName":"Dyson","initials":"NJ","foreName":"Nicholas J"},{"lastName":"Haber","initials":"DA","foreName":"Daniel A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14643,"articleTitle":"Recovery of nicotine-free proteins from tobacco leaves using phosphate buffer system under controlled conditions.","dateCreated":"2010-02-03","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-2976","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Bioresource technology","isoAbbreviation":"Bioresour.

Empirical and theoretical contributions from biological anthropology, physiology, and demography have established the foundation necessary for developing a comprehensive understanding, grounded in life history theory (LHT), of temporal, individual, and populational variation in women's reproductive functioning. LHT posits that natural selection leads to the evolution of mechanisms that tend to allocate resources to the competing demands of growth, reproduction, and survival such that fitness is locally maximized. (That is, among alternative allocation patterns exhibited in a population, those having the highest inclusive fitness will become more common over generational time.) Hence, strategic modulation of reproductive effort is potentially adaptive because investment in a new conception may risk one's own survival, future reproductive opportunities, and/or current offspring survival. The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis is the principal neuroendocrine pathway by which the human female modulates reproductive functioning according to the changing conditions in her habitat. Adjustments of reproductive investment in a potential conception are manifested in temporal and individual variation in ovarian cycle length, ovulation, hormone levels, and the probability of conception. Understanding the extent and causes of adaptive and non-adaptive variation in ovarian functioning is fundamental to ascertaining the proximate and remote determinants of human reproductive patterns. In this review I consider what is known and what still needs to be learned of the ecology of women's reproductive biology, beginning with a discussion of the principal explanatory frameworks in HRE and the biometry of ovarian functioning. Turning next to empirical studies, it is evident that marked variation between cycles, women, and populations is the norm rather than an aberration. Other than woman's age, the determinants of these differences are not well characterized, although developmental conditions, dietary practices, genetic variation, and epigenetic mechanisms have all been hypothesized to play some role. It is also evident that the reproductive functioning of women born and living in arduous conditions is not analogous to that of athletes, dieters, or even the lower end of the \"normal range\" of HPO functioning in wealthier populations. Contrary to the presumption that humans have low fecundity and an inefficient reproductive system, both theory and present evidence suggest that we may actually have very high fecundity and a reproductive system that has evolved to be flexible, ruthlessly efficient and, most importantly, strategic.","PMID":19890865,"authors":[{"lastName":"Vitzthum","initials":"VJ","foreName":"Virginia J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14641,"articleTitle":"Effects of hydrophobicity and anions on self-assembly of the peptide EMK16-II.","dateCreated":"2010-02-01","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"0006-3525","issnType":"Print","title":"Biopolymers","isoAbbreviation":"Biopolymers"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Effects of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions on the self-assembling process of the ionic-complementary peptide EMK16-II are investigated by atomic force microscopy imaging, circular dichroism spectra, light scattering, and chromatography. It is found that the hydrophobicity of the peptide promotes the aggregation in pure water even at a very low concentration, resulting in a much lower critical aggregation concentration than that of another peptide, EAK16-II. The effect of anions in solution with different valences on electrostatic interactions is also important. Monovalent anions (Cl(-) and Ac(-)) with a proper concentration can facilitate the formation of peptide fibrils, with Cl(-) of smaller size being more effective than Ac(-) of larger size. However, only small amounts of fibrils, but plenty of large amorphous aggregates, are found when the peptide solution is incubated with multivalent anions, such as SO(4)(2-), C(6)H(5)O(7) (3-), and HPO(4)(2-). More importantly, by gel filtration chromatography, the citrate anion, which induces a similar effect on the self-assembling process of EMK16-II as that of SO(4)(2-) and HPO(4)(2-), can interact with two or more positively charged residues of the peptide and reside in the amorphous aggregates. This implies a \"salt bridge\" effect of multivalent anions on the peptide self-assembling process, which can interpret a previous puzzle why divalent cations inhibit the formation of ordered nanofibrils of the ionic-complementary peptides. Thus, our results clarify the important effects of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions on the self-assembling process of the ionic-complementary peptides.

In the present research, we examined chemical precipitation recycle technology (CPRT) for ammonium nitrogen removal from coking wastewater. The pyrolysate resulting from magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) pyrogenation in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was recycled for ammonium nitrogen removal from coking wastewater. The objective of this study was to investigate the conditions for MAP pyrogenation and to characterize of MAP pyrolysate for its feasibility in recycling. Furthermore, MAP pyrolysate was characterized by scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD). The MAP pyrolysate could be produced at the optimal condition of a hydroxyl (OH(-)) to ammonium molar ratio of 2:1, a heating temperature of 110 degrees C, and a heating time of 3h. Surface characterization analysis indicated that the main component of the pyrolysate was amorphous magnesium sodium phosphate (MgNaPO(4)). The pyrolysate could be recycled as a magnesium and phosphate source at an optimum pH of 9.5. When the recycle times were increased, the ammonium nitrogen removal ratio gradually decreased if the pyrolysate was used without supplementation. When the recycle times were increased, the ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency was not decreased if the added pyrolysate was supplemented with MgCl(2).6H(2)O plus Na(2)HPO(4).12H(2)O during treatment. A high ammonium nitrogen removal ratio was obtained by using pre-formed MAP as seeding material.","PMID":19850316,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"T","foreName":"Tao"},{"lastName":"Ding","initials":"L","foreName":"Lili"},{"lastName":"Ren","initials":"H","foreName":"Hongqiang"},{"lastName":"Xiong","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14580,"articleTitle":"Herding Hippos: regulating growth in flies and man.","dateCreated":"2009-12-02","dateRevised":"2009-12-02","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0410","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Current opinion in cell biology","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

In this study, CPE0201, a putative acid phosphatase gene deduced by genome analysis, was shown to encode a non-specific acid phosphatase in C. perfringens. Multiple alignments of the amino acid sequence showed that CPE0201 shares two signature motifs that belong to a class C acid phosphatase family. Expression of CPE0201 was shown to be positively regulated by the global VirR/VirS-VR-RNA regulatory cascade at the transcriptional level. To determine the acid phosphatase activity of the CPE0201-encoded protein, cloning, expression, purification and several biochemical characterizations were carried out. The optimum pH for activity of the CPE0201 enzyme was 4.8, and its V(max) and K(m) were 3.08 nmol ml(-1) min(-1) and 2.84 mM, respectively, with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) as substrate.

This process can be complicated by the fact that the features can have varying degrees of specificity, as well as by the presence of features unrelated to the disease itself.

We have adapted semantic similarity metrics to measure phenotypic similarity between queries and hereditary diseases annotated with the use of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and have developed a statistical model to assign p values to the resulting similarity scores, which can be used to rank the candidate diseases. We show that our approach outperforms simpler term-matching approaches that do not take the semantic interrelationships between terms into account. The advantage of our approach was greater for queries containing phenotypic noise or imprecise clinical descriptions. The semantic network defined by the HPO can be used to refine the differential diagnosis by suggesting clinical features that, if present, best differentiate among the candidate diagnoses. Thus, semantic similarity searches in ontologies represent a useful way of harnessing the semantic structure of human phenotypic abnormalities to help with the differential diagnosis.

Here, we characterize the interaction between MST2 and another mammalian RASSF isoform, RASSF6. When bound to MST2, RASSF6 inhibited MST2 activity to antagonize Hippo signaling. However, RASSF6 caused apoptosis when released from activated MST2 in a manner dependent on WW45, the mammalian Salvador homolog. Thus, RASSF6 antagonizes Hippo signaling and mediates apoptosis through a pathway that is parallel to the canonical Hippo pathway. Our findings suggest that activation of MST2 causes apoptosis through the Hippo pathway, as well as through a RASSF6-mediated pathway.","PMID":19797269,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ikeda","initials":"M","foreName":"Mitsunobu"},{"lastName":"Kawata","initials":"A","foreName":"Akira"},{"lastName":"Nishikawa","initials":"M","foreName":"Misa"},{"lastName":"Tateishi","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuko"},{"lastName":"Yamaguchi","initials":"M","foreName":"Masato"},{"lastName":"Nakagawa","initials":"K","foreName":"Kentaro"},{"lastName":"Hirabayashi","initials":"S","foreName":"Susumu"},{"lastName":"Bao","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yijun"},{"lastName":"Hidaka","initials":"S","foreName":"Shiho"},{"lastName":"Hirata","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yukio"},{"lastName":"Hata","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yutaka"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14628,"articleTitle":"Aliphatic beta-nitroalcohols for therapeutic corneoscleral cross-linking: chemical mechanisms and higher order nitroalcohols.","dateCreated":"2010-01-19","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1552-5783","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Investigative ophthalmology & visual science","isoAbbreviation":"Invest.

The present study was performed to identify the specific chemistry involved under physiologic conditions, with the intent of identifying more effective agents.The mechanism of chemical cross-linking at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C was studied using three techniques. The colorimetric Griess assay was used to follow the release of nitrite from three mono-nitroalcohols (2-nitroethanol [2ne], 2-nitro-1-propanol [2nprop]), and 3-nitro-2-pentanol [3n2pent]). Second, the evolution of 2nprop in 0.2 M NaH(2)PO(4)/Na(2)HPO(4)/D(2)O was studied using (1)H-NMR. Third, thermal shrinkage temperature analysis (T(s)), a measure of tissue cross-linking, was used to support information from (1)the H-NMR studies.A time-dependent release of nitrite was observed for all three mono-nitroalcohols studied. The maximum levels were comparable using either 2ne or 2nprop (approximately 30%). However, much less (approximately 10%) was observed from 3n2pent. Using (1)H-NMR, 2nprop evolved into a unique splitting pattern. No match was observed with reference spectra from three possible products of denitration. In contrast, 2-methyl-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (MNPD), a nitro-diol, was identified, implying the formation of formaldehyde from a retro-nitroaldol (i.e., reverse Henry) reaction. In support of this mechanism, T(s) shifts induced by the nitro-triol 2-hydroxymethyl-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (HNPD) were superior to the nitro-diol MNPD which were superior to the mono nitroalcohol 2nprop.BNAs function as both formaldehyde and nitrite donors under physiologic conditions to cross-link collagenous tissue.

We present here evidence for an alternate pathway in which Yorkie activity is repressed by direct physical association with three other pathway components: Expanded, Hippo, and Warts. Each of these Yorkie repressors contains one or more PPXY sequence motifs, and associates with Yorkie via binding of these PPXY motifs to WW domains of Yorkie. This direct binding inhibits Yorkie activity independently from effects on Yorkie phosphorylation, and does so both in vivo and in cultured cell assays. These results emphasize the importance of the relative levels of Yorkie and its upstream tumor suppressors to Yorkie regulation, and suggest a dual repression model, in which upstream tumor suppressors can regulate Yorkie activity both by promoting Yorkie phosphorylation and by direct binding.","PMID":19733165,"authors":[{"lastName":"Oh","initials":"H","foreName":"Hyangyee"},{"lastName":"Reddy","initials":"BV","foreName":"B V V G"},{"lastName":"Irvine","initials":"KD","foreName":"Kenneth D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14489,"articleTitle":"Biomimetic fabrication of hydroxyapatite-polysaccharide-formate dehydrogenase composite capsules for efficient CO(2) conversion.","dateCreated":"2009-09-02","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1568-5624","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of biomaterials science.

The dewaterability (vacuum filtration) of precipitates produced during the treatment of soil leachate was established as follows on the basis of the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) values: sulphides (4.3 x 10(12)mkg(-1))<phosphates (6.4 x 10(12) m kg(-1))<hydroxides [Ca(OH)(2)] (14.2 x 10(12) m kg(-1))<hydroxides [NaOH] (19.7 x 10(12) m kg(-1))<carbonates (26.5 x 10(12) m kg(-1)). For the fly ash leachate treatment, the obtained results were quite similar no matter the treatment mode used; the SRF values were in a range of 5-7 x 10(12) m kg(-1), while sludge volume index (SVI) ranged from 39 to 50 mL g(-1). The sludge generated during the treatment of sewage sludge filtrate using phosphate salt gave the best results regarding to SVI and SRF parameters (180 mL g(-1) and 7.6 x 10(12) m kg(-1), respectively).

Under our experimental conditions, peptone, urea and yeast extract were found to be major factors. Then, the steepest ascent method and the central composite design were applied to optimize the culture of Lact. fermentum. The following composition of the fermentation medium was estimated to be the most economical formula (per litre): 30 g corn syrup, 15 g glucose, 14.4 g peptone, 7 g (NH(4))(2)SO(4), 0.5 g urea, 3 g sodium acetate, 4 g sodium citrate, 0.1 g MnSO(4).4H(2)O, 0.5 g MgSO(4).7H(2)O, 7.3 g yeast extract, 0.5 g K(2)HPO(4).Based on 10 side-by-side comparisons, we found that the yield of Lact. fermentum using our fermentation medium was 64% greater than those using modified de Man, Rogosa and Sharp broth (MRS) medium (1.8 x 10(9) CFU ml(-1)vs 1.1 x 10(9) CFU ml(-1), respectively), while the cost was 89% lower than MRS. This research indicates that it is possible to increase bacterial yield by using inexpensive materials.It is more likely that the use of Lact. fermentum as a probiotic will increase.

In this study, a novel organic-inorganic composite, which contains human hair proteins and hydroxyapatite, was investigated as biomineral-scaffolding materials. The human hair protein was extracted by our original \"Shindai method\" (Nakamura et al., Biol Pharm Bull 2002;25:569-572; Fujii et al., Biol Pharm Bull 2004;27:89-93). The extracts were exposed to CaCl(2) solution for fabrication into flat films, which mainly consisted of alpha-keratin. After washing with distilled water, approximately 3 Ca(2+) ions per 1 keratin molecule bound to the film. The Ca(2+)-binding was slightly sensitive to the ionic strengths, and only Mg(2+) inhibited binding of Ca(2+). A composite of the human hair protein and calcium phosphate was prepared via alternate soaking processes using CaCl(2) and Na(2)HPO(4) solutions. As the soaking cycle proceeded, the film weight increased and its color became white, indicating successful deposition of calcium phosphate. The diameters of deposited calcium phosphate particles were about 2-4 microm. The proteins were not solubilized and degraded during the soaking processes. FTIR and WAXD analyses indicated that calcium phosphate was first deposited as amorphous, then transformed into crystalline monohydrogen calcium phosphate during the earlier soaking cycle, and, via octacalcium phosphate, finally converted into hydroxyapatite after 20 cycles. The present human hair protein/hydroxyapatite composite film is a \"self-originated\" and also an intact proteinaceous material without chemical modification, and thus, a promising material for hard tissue engineering.","PMID":19708078,"authors":[{"lastName":"Fujii","initials":"T","foreName":"Toshihiro"},{"lastName":"Tanaka","initials":"T","foreName":"Teppei"},{"lastName":"Ohkawa","initials":"K","foreName":"Kousaku"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14487,"articleTitle":"Optimization of activated carbon fiber preparation from Kenaf using K2HPO4 as chemical activator for adsorption of phenolic compounds.","dateCreated":"2009-08-31","dateRevised":"2016-11-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-2976","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Bioresource technology","isoAbbreviation":"Bioresour.

Although intensive research on pathological phenomena of endometrial cancer is currently going on, but exact cause and biological aspects of this disease are not well described yet. In addition to well-documented roles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in hypopituitary ovarian (HPO) axis, the agonistic or antagonistic analogs (or both) of GnRH have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of human gynecologic cancers. Thus, in the present study, we further examined the possibility that GnRH induces integrin beta3 and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1/2 and p38, to inhibit the growth of HEC1A endometrial cancer cell line. As a result, both GnRH-I and GnRH-II resulted in a significant increase in integrin beta3 expression and evoked the activation of FAK in a time-dependent manner in these cells. In addition, these analogs induced an activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner as downstream pathways of FAK. It appears that GnRH-II has much greater effect on the activation of FAK, ERK1/2 and p38 compared to GnRH-I in these cells. Further, we demonstrated that the growth inhibition of HEC1A cells by GnRH-I or GnRH-II is involved in the activation of integrin-FAK and ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Taken together, these results suggest that GnRH may be involved in the inhibition of endometrial cancer cell growth via activation of integrin beta3 and FAK as a direct effect. This knowledge could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the therapeutic action of GnRH and its biomedical application for the treatment against endometrial cancer.","PMID":19656390,"authors":[{"lastName":"Park","initials":"DW","foreName":"Dong Wook"},{"lastName":"Choi","initials":"KC","foreName":"Kyung-Chul"},{"lastName":"MacCalman","initials":"CD","foreName":"Colin D"},{"lastName":"Leung","initials":"PC","foreName":"Peter C K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14488,"articleTitle":"The influence of amine functionalities on anion binding in polyamide-containing macrocycles.","dateCreated":"2009-09-01","dateRevised":"2009-09-01","publication":{"issnNumber":"1523-7052","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Organic letters","isoAbbreviation":"Org.

Several SWH pathway components are mutated or expressed at altered levels in different human tumors including NF2, LATS1, LATS2, SAV1, and YAP. The SWH pathway regulates tissue growth by restricting the activity of the transcriptional coactivator protein known as Yorkie (Yki) in Drosophila melanogaster and Yes-associated protein (YAP) in mammals. Yki/YAP drives tissue growth in partnership with the Scalloped (Sd)/TEAD1-4 transcription factors. Yki/YAP also possesses two WW domains, which contact several proteins that have been suggested to either promote or inhibit the ability of Yki to induce transcription. To investigate the regulatory role of the Yki/YAP WW domains, we analyzed the functional consequence of mutating these domains. WW domain mutant YAP promoted transformation and migration of breast epithelial cells with increased potency, suggesting that WW domains mediate the inhibitory regulation of YAP in these cells. By contrast, the WW domains were required for YAP to promote NIH-3T3 cell transformation and for the ability of Yki to drive tissue growth in D. melanogaster and optimally activate Sd. This shows that Yki/YAP WW domains have distinct regulatory roles in different cell types and implies the existence of proteins that promote tissue growth in collaboration with Yki and Sd.","PMID":19584286,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaomeng"},{"lastName":"Milton","initials":"CC","foreName":"Claire C"},{"lastName":"Humbert","initials":"PO","foreName":"Patrick O"},{"lastName":"Harvey","initials":"KF","foreName":"Kieran F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14432,"articleTitle":"Tryptophanase-catalyzed L-tryptophan synthesis from D-serine in the presence of diammonium hydrogen phosphate.","dateCreated":"2009-07-07","dateRevised":"2017-02-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"1422-0067","issnType":"Electronic","title":"International journal of molecular sciences","isoAbbreviation":"Int J Mol Sci"},"articleDate":"2009-06-03","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Tryptophanase, an enzyme with extreme absolute stereospecificity for optically active stereoisomers, catalyzes the synthesis of l-tryptophan from l-serine and indole through a beta-substitution mechanism of the ping-pong type, and has no activity on d-serine.

A high-speed blender and ultrasound-assisted homogenization/extraction was carried out in the presence of perchloric acid (1.5 ml, 0.6 mol l(-1)), l-cysteine (500 microl, 0.75 mol l(-1)) and 500 microl toluene:methanol (1:1).

Extensive Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations of the orthophosphate ion PO(4)(3-), of the hydrogen phosphate anions, HPO(4)(2-) and H(2)PO(4)(-), and of the orthophosphoric acid, H(3)PO(4), in explicit water show that the process of proton transfer from H(n)PO(4)(3-n) to the surrounding water molecules is very fast, less than 1 ps, and indicate that the dehydrogenation occurs through a concerted proton hopping mechanism, which involves H(n)PO(4)(3-n) and three water molecules. Analysis of the intermolecular H(n)PO(4)(3-n)-water structure shows that the PO(4)(3-) anions have a significant effect on the H-bonding network of bulk water and the presence of P-O(-) moieties induce the formation of new types of H-H interactions around this orthophosphate. Calculated probability distributions of the coordination numbers of the first hydration shell of PO(4)(3-), HPO(4)(2-), and H(2)PO(4)(-) show that these phosphate species display a flexible first coordination shell (between 7 and 13 water molecules) and that the flexibility increases on going from PO(4)(3-) to H(2)PO(4)(-). The strength and number of hydrogen bonds of PO(4)(3-), HPO(4)(2-), and H(2)PO(4)(-) are determined through a detailed analysis of the structural correlation functions. In particular, the H-bond interactions between the oxygen atoms of the phosphates and the surrounding water molecules, which decrease on going from PO(4)(3-) to the hydrogenated H(2)PO(4)(-) species, explain the diminished effect on the structure of water with the increasing hydrogenation of the orthophosphate anions.","PMID":19548734,"authors":[{"lastName":"Tang","initials":"E","foreName":"Emilia"},{"lastName":"Di Tommaso","initials":"D","foreName":"Devis"},{"lastName":"de Leeuw","initials":"NH","foreName":"Nora H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14440,"articleTitle":"Phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor fat is regulated by its ligand Dachsous and the kinase discs overgrown.","dateCreated":"2009-07-15","dateRevised":"2016-11-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0445","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

The biochemical nature of how Fat, Ds, and Dco interact to regulate these pathways is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Fat is cleaved to generate 450 kDa and 110 kDa fragments (Fat(450) and Fat(110)). Fat(110) contains the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain. The cytoplasmic domain of Fat binds Dco and is phosphorylated by Dco at multiple sites.

In the wing imaginal disc epithelium, we observe increased staining for members of the apical polarity complexes aPKC and Crumbs as well as adherens junction components when Hippo activity is compromised, while basolateral markers are not affected. This increase in apical proteins is correlated with a hypertrophy of the apical domain and adherens junctions. The cell surface localisation of the Notch receptor is also increased in mutant clones, opening the possibility that aberrant receptor signalling may participate in overgrowth of hpo-deficient tissue.

Our previous work in Drosophila indicated that Merlin (Mer) and Expanded (Ex) are members of the Hippo pathway and act upstream of the Hippo kinase.

In the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), backscattering from first-shell O atoms dominated the chi(k) spectra. Multiple scattering (MS) via a four-legged P-O(1)-P-O(1)-P collinear path was localized in the lower k region at approximately 3.5 A(-1) and contributed significantly to the beat pattern of the first oscillation. For EXAFS analysis, increasing Debye-Waller factors suggest more disorder in the P-O shell with addition of protons to the crystal structure due to the lengthening effects of P-OH bonds. This disorder produces splitting in the hybridized P 3p-O 2p band in the density of states. For aqueous samples, however, increased protonation reduced the structural disorder within this shell. This was linked to a change from kosmotropic to chaotropic behavior of the phosphate species, with reduced effects of H bonding on structural distortion. The intensity of MS is correlated to the degree of disorder in the P-O shell, with more ordered structures exhibiting enhanced MS. The observed trends in the XAFS data can be used to distinguish between phosphate species in both solid and aqueous samples. This is applicable to many chemical, geochemical and biological systems, and may be an important tool for determining the behavior of phosphate during the hydrothermal gasification of biomass.","PMID":19489547,"authors":[{"lastName":"Rouff","initials":"AA","foreName":"Ashaki A"},{"lastName":"Rabe","initials":"S","foreName":"Stefan"},{"lastName":"Nachtegaal","initials":"M","foreName":"Maarten"},{"lastName":"Vogel","initials":"F","foreName":"Frédéric"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14452,"articleTitle":"Response surface methodology for optimization of medium components in submerged culture of Aspergillus flavus for enhanced heparinase production.","dateCreated":"2009-07-27","dateRevised":"2012-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"1472-765X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Letters in applied microbiology","isoAbbreviation":"Lett.

Generally alginate hydrogels have been produced by contacting alginate solution with CaCl(2) as a cross-linking agent. However, the major disadvantages of this system are that the gelation rate is too fast and hard to control, and the prepared alginate gels cannot be injected. Injectable alginates have been prepared by using CaSO(4) or CaCO(3) as a cross-linking agent. However, the gelation rate of alginate with CaCO(3) is slow owing to the low solubility of CaCO(3) in water, while that with CaSO(4) is too fast to form uniform gels. In this study, we prepared injectable alginate/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blend hydrogels with controllable gelation rate by using CaSO(4) as a cross-linking agent and Na(2)HPO(4) as a cross-linking retardation agent. The gelation rate could be controlled by adjusting CaSO(4)/Na(2)HPO(4) ratio in the solution. The alginate and PVA showed good compatibility in aqueous solutions or gels. The gelation rate of alginate increased with increasing Na(2)HPO(4) and decreasing CaSO(4) concentrations, as expected. The PVA itself in the alginate/PVA blend did not affect the gelation rate. All alginate/PVA hydrogels demonstrated some extraction of PVA, but the extraction extent was not much even after 7 days immersion in water. The alginate/PVA hydrogels were examined for their in vitro cell compatibility by the culture of chondrocytes (human chondrocyte cell line) in the gels up to 28 days. The cells were grown almost linearly in the alginate/PVA hydrogels with higher PVA compositions showing better cell growth. The GAG contents from the cells in the hydrogels did not show dramatic changes with culture time, however, they also increased gradually in the alginate/PVA hydrogels with higher PVA composition. The PVA in the hydrogels seemed to play positive roles for the growth and activity of chondrocytes. The alginate/PVA hydrogels with controllable gelation rate are expected to be applicable as injectable cell carriers.","PMID":19454157,"authors":[{"lastName":"Cho","initials":"SH","foreName":"Sang Ho"},{"lastName":"Lim","initials":"SM","foreName":"Sung Mook"},{"lastName":"Han","initials":"DK","foreName":"Dong Keun"},{"lastName":"Yuk","initials":"SH","foreName":"Soon Hong"},{"lastName":"Im","initials":"GI","foreName":"Gun Il"},{"lastName":"Lee","initials":"JH","foreName":"Jin Ho"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14382,"articleTitle":"Wet chemical synthesis of chitosan hydrogel-hydroxyapatite composite membranes for tissue engineering applications.","dateCreated":"2009-05-18","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0003","issnType":"Electronic","title":"International journal of biological macromolecules","isoAbbreviation":"Int.

The three-dimensional structure of PfluDING was obtained at subangstrom resolution (0.88 and 0.98 A) at two different pH's (4.5 and 8.5), allowing us to discuss the hydrogen bond network that sequesters the phosphate ion in the binding site. From this high resolution data, we experimentally elucidated the molecular basis of phosphate binding in phosphate SBPs. The phosphate ion is tightly bound to the protein via 12 hydrogen bonds between phosphate oxygen atoms and OH and NH groups of the protein. The proton on one oxygen atom of the phosphate dianion forms a 2.5 A low barrier hydrogen bond with an aspartate, with the energy released by forming this strong bond ensuring the specificity for the dianion even at pH 4.5. In particular, contrary to previous theories on phosphate SBPs, accurate electrostatic potential calculations show that the binding cleft is positively charged. PfluDING structures reveal that only dibasic phosphate binds to the protein at both acidic and basic phosphate, suggesting that the protein binding site environment stabilizes the HPO(4)(2-) form of phosphate.","PMID":19445459,"authors":[{"lastName":"Liebschner","initials":"D","foreName":"Dorothee"},{"lastName":"Elias","initials":"M","foreName":"Mikael"},{"lastName":"Moniot","initials":"S","foreName":"Sèbastien"},{"lastName":"Fournier","initials":"B","foreName":"Bertrand"},{"lastName":"Scott","initials":"K","foreName":"Ken"},{"lastName":"Jelsch","initials":"C","foreName":"Christian"},{"lastName":"Guillot","initials":"B","foreName":"Benoit"},{"lastName":"Lecomte","initials":"C","foreName":"Claude"},{"lastName":"Chabrière","initials":"E","foreName":"Eric"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14438,"articleTitle":"Reduction of trihalomethane precursors of dissolved organic matter in the secondary effluent by advanced treatment processes.","dateCreated":"2009-07-13","dateRevised":"2009-07-13","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3336","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of hazardous materials","isoAbbreviation":"J.

DOM in the secondary effluent and the treated effluents was fractionated into five classes using XAD resins: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N), and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). Results showed that HPO-A and HPI were two main fractions of the DOM in the secondary effluent, accounting for 30.0% and 45.5% of the bulk DOM, respectively. HPO-A exhibited higher trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and specific THMFP (STHMFP) than HPI during the chlorination process. The order of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal with respect to different advanced treatments was observed to be GAC+SAT>SAT>GAC>sand column>HSFW. As for the DOM removal mechanisms, the advanced treatment processes of GAC adsorption, SAT and GAC+SAT tended to adsorb more HPO-A, HPO-N and TPI-A and could reduce the aromaticity of those DOM fractions efficiently. Correspondingly, the advanced treatment processes of sand column, SAT, HSFW and GAC+SAT removed more HPI and TPI-N through biodegradation and each of the DOM fractions had an increased aromaticity. The removal order of the THMs precursor by the advanced treatment processes was GAC+SAT>GAC>SAT>sand column>HSFW. The adsorption reduced the STHMFP of the DOM fractions effectively, whereas the biodegradation mechanism of the treatments (sand column, SAT, GAC+SAT and HSFW) showed a converse trend. Moreover, the THMFP and STHMFP of the DOM in the HSFW effluent were obviously affected by the DOM derived from the leaves and roots.","PMID":19443112,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"LL","foreName":"Liang-Liang"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"QL","foreName":"Qing-Liang"},{"lastName":"Xue","initials":"S","foreName":"Shuang"},{"lastName":"Chang","initials":"CC","foreName":"Chein-Chi"},{"lastName":"Tang","initials":"F","foreName":"Feng"},{"lastName":"Liang","initials":"GL","foreName":"Guan-Liang"},{"lastName":"Jia","initials":"T","foreName":"Ting"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14445,"articleTitle":"Phosphorus leaching from soils amended with thermally gasified piggery waste ash.","dateCreated":"2009-07-20","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-2456","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)","isoAbbreviation":"Waste Manag"},"articleDate":"2009-05-07","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In regions with intensive livestock farming, thermal treatment for local energy extraction from the manure and export of the P rich ash as a fertilizer has gained interest.

In contrast, a neutral loss of metaphosphoric acid HPO(3) (80 Da) is negligible from the deprotonated phosphotyrosine peptides. The efficient H(3)PO(4) release is unexpected, given the structure of phosphotyrosine. Our study reveals that the abundant [M-H-98](-) product ions of pTyr-peptides are not a result of consecutive losses of HPO(3) and H(2)O but, rather, are induced by an intramolecular interaction of the phosphotyrosine phosphate with deprotonated peptide functions such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and to a small extent, amide. As a result, an internal phosphotyrosine phosphate shift occurs, and the obtained phosphorylated functionalities undergo elimination of H(3)PO(4) to give rise to the [M-H-98](-) fragments. The mechanism proposed for the phosphoric acid neutral loss is based on extensive CID studies of Ala-substituted model phosphorylated peptides and oxygen-18 labeling. The proposed mechanistic pathway explains the fact that the pTyr phosphate transfer and the subsequent H(3)PO(4) neutral loss are not observed for multiply charged anions of pTyr-peptides. Monoanions of pSer-containing peptides undergo the intramolecular phosphate shift as well, although its efficiency is much lower compared to the aromatic phosphorylation sites. These observations facilitate correct identification of pSer-, pThr-, and pTyr-peptides in CID studies. This work demonstrates that the established phosphate-specific neutral loss fragmentation rules of protonated pTyr-peptides cannot be applied to the CID spectra of their [M-H](-) ions.","PMID":19402683,"authors":[{"lastName":"Edelson-Averbukh","initials":"M","foreName":"Marina"},{"lastName":"Shevchenko","initials":"A","foreName":"Andrej"},{"lastName":"Pipkorn","initials":"R","foreName":"Rüdiger"},{"lastName":"Lehmann","initials":"WD","foreName":"Wolf D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14355,"articleTitle":"An optimized buffer system for NMR-based urinary metabonomics with effective pH control, chemical shift consistency and dilution minimization.","dateCreated":"2009-04-21","dateRevised":"2009-04-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1364-5528","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Analyst","isoAbbreviation":"Analyst"},"articleDate":"2009-02-23","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"NMR-based metabonomics has been widely employed to understand the stressor-induced perturbations to mammalian metabolism.

We found that the chemical shifts were decreased with the rise of pH but increased with the increase of ionic strength, which probably resulted from the pH- and ionic strength-induced alteration to the ionization equilibrium for the function groups. We also found that the chemical shift variations for most metabolites were reduced to less than 0.004 ppm when the pH was 7.1-7.7 and the salt concentration was less than 0.15 M.

The hardened samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and apparent density measurements. The IS technique was employed as a non-destructive tool to obtain information related to porosity, tortuosity and homogeneity of the cement microstructures. The formulation prepared from a TTCP/DCPA equimolar mixture and OA as the liquid phase presented the shortest I and F (12 and 20 min, respectively) in comparison to the other studied systems. XRD analyses revealed the formation of low-crystallinity hydroxyapatite (HA) (as the main phase) as well as the presence of little amounts of unreacted DCPA and TTCP after 24 h hardening in 100% relative humidity. This was related to the proposed mechanisms of dissolution of the reactants. The bands observed by FTIR allowed identifying the presence of calcium tartrate and calcium oxalate in the samples prepared from TA and OA, in addition to the characteristic bands of HA. High degree of entanglement of the formed crystals was observed by SEM in samples containing OA. SEM images were also correlated to the apparent densities of the hardened cements. Changes in porosity, tortuosity and microstructural homogeneity were determined in all samples, from IS results, when the TTCP/DCPA ratio was changed from 1/1 to 1/2. The cement formulated from an equimolar mixture of TTCP/DCPA and OA as the liquid phase presented setting times, degree of conversion to low-crystallinity HA and microstructural features suitable to be used as potential bone cement in clinical applications. The IS technique was shown to be a very sensitive and non-destructive tool to relate the paste composition to the developed microstructures. This approach could be very useful to develop calcium phosphate bone cements for specific clinical demands.","PMID":19347256,"authors":[{"lastName":"Romeo","initials":"HE","foreName":"H E"},{"lastName":"Bueno","initials":"PR","foreName":"P R"},{"lastName":"Fanovich","initials":"MA","foreName":"M A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14357,"articleTitle":"On the intramolecular origin of the blue shift of A-H stretching frequencies: triatomic hydrides HAX.","dateCreated":"2009-04-23","dateRevised":"2009-04-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-5215","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The journal of physical chemistry.

To understand how Expanded regulates Hippo pathway activity, we used affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify Expanded-binding proteins. Surprisingly we find that Yorkie is the major Expanded-binding protein in Drosophila S2 cells. Expanded binds Yorkie at endogenous levels via WW-domain-PPxY interactions, independently of Yorkie phosphorylation at S168, which is critical for 14-3-3 binding. Expanded relocalizes Yorkie from the nucleus, abrogating its nuclear activity, and it can regulate growth downstream of warts in vivo. These data lead to a new model whereby Expanded functions downstream of Warts, in concert with 14-3-3 proteins to sequester Yorkie in the cytoplasm, inhibiting growth activity of the Hippo pathway.","PMID":19289086,"authors":[{"lastName":"Badouel","initials":"C","foreName":"Caroline"},{"lastName":"Gardano","initials":"L","foreName":"Laura"},{"lastName":"Amin","initials":"N","foreName":"Nancy"},{"lastName":"Garg","initials":"A","foreName":"Ankush"},{"lastName":"Rosenfeld","initials":"R","foreName":"Robyn"},{"lastName":"Le Bihan","initials":"T","foreName":"Thierry"},{"lastName":"McNeill","initials":"H","foreName":"Helen"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14320,"articleTitle":"Harness the power: new insights into the inhibition of YAP/Yorkie.","dateCreated":"2009-03-17","dateRevised":"2009-05-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1878-1551","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Developmental cell","isoAbbreviation":"Dev.

Accuracy was checked for phosphite determination in five fertilizer samples. Results were in agreement at the 95% confidence level (paired t test) with spectrophotometry. Recoveries of phosphite added to fertilizer samples ranged from 97% to 102% regardless of the amount of spiking in several determinations. The relative standard deviation (n = 10) was 1.0% for a diluted sample containing 0.050 mol L(-1) Na(2)HPO(3).","PMID":19117396,"authors":[{"lastName":"Franzini","initials":"VP","foreName":"Vanessa P"},{"lastName":"Moraes","initials":"Md","foreName":"Mercedes de"},{"lastName":"Neto","initials":"JA","foreName":"José A Gomes"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15111,"articleTitle":"Dilead(II) hydrogen-phosphite dinitrate.","dateCreated":"2011-05-17","dateRevised":"2011-12-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"1600-5368","issnType":"Print","title":"Acta crystallographica.

Eighteen wether goats were randomly allocated into group A, B and C evenly and fed with cottonseed meal and rice straw diet for three months. From day 60 onwards, KH(2)PO(4) and K(2)HPO(4) were provided via drinking water to goats in group B to increase the intake of P, K, and MgO to goats in group C to increase the intake of Mg. Blood and urine samples were collected to analyze the concentration of P, K, Mg and Ca, and the activity product (AP) of potassium magnesium phosphate (MKP) in urine was also calculated. The composition of calculi and urinary sedimentary crystals were examined by chemical qualitative analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the incidence of urolithiasis in group C (6/6) was higher than that in group A (1/6) and B (1/6) (P<0.05). The calculi were mainly composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) and partly composed of MKP. MKP presented in crystals of different phases in this experiment. The high intake of Mg contributed to a significant increase of plasma Mg, but additional P, K did not cause a further increase of plasma P, K. Urine P, K, Mg and Ca and AP of MKP in group C decreased significantly after the onset of urolithiasis. In conclusion, high intake of Mg was more important in inducing struvite calculi compared with high intake of K and P in goats under these feeding conditions. Cottonseed meal and rice straw with additional Mg is a good dietary model for inducing struvite calculi in castrated goats.","PMID":19091365,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"JY","foreName":"Jin-Yong"},{"lastName":"Sun","initials":"WD","foreName":"Wei-Dong"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"XL","foreName":"Xiao-Long"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14229,"articleTitle":"The effect of a physiologic solution pH on properties of white mineral trioxide aggregate.","dateCreated":"2008-12-16","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1878-3554","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of endodontics","isoAbbreviation":"J Endod"},"articleDate":"2008-10-31","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two solutions differing by pH (6.4 and 4.0) and the use of a setting accelerator (15% Na(2)HPO(4) solution) on the properties of white-colored mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA).

The aim of this study was to develop a calibration method to evaluate mineral density profiles in dentine including changes associated with dentinal caries. A series of K(2)HPO(4) solution phantoms in a concentration range between 0 and 0.9 g cm(-3)--coupled to a set of water infiltrated porous solid hydroxyapatite (HA) phantoms, with mineral densities ranging from 1.52 to 2.08 g cm(-3), was used in this investigation. First we evaluated the micrometer-scale homogeneity and noise in the HA phantoms using a commercial laboratory micro-CT system. Then an experimental validation was performed of the linearity over the entire density range of these two different calibration materials. The results show the HA phantoms extended the calibration curve obtained from K(2)HPO(4) solution phantoms to densities as high as 2.08 g cm(-3); the linearity remains stable at different energy levels. Finally, compared to the reference micro-CT calibration methods, the advantages of this new method are discussed.

However, when multiple potential sites of phosphorylation exist within a phosphorylated peptide sequence, unambiguous characterization of the site of phosphorylation remains a significant challenge. Here, the gas-phase fragmentation reactions of a series of 33 synthetic phospho-serine, -threonine, and -tyrosine peptides containing multiple potential phosphorylation sites have been examined using collision induced dissociation (CID) and multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MS(3)) in a linear quadrupole ion trap. From this study, 15 of the peptides (45%) gave rise to product ions that were formed following initial transfer of a phosphate group from the phosphorylated residue to an unmodified hydroxyl-containing amino acid residue upon CID-MS/MS. The propensity for this rearrangement was found to be highly dependent on the precursor ion charge state and amino acid composition (i.e, proton mobility) of the peptide and was observed predominantly for peptides under \"nonmobile\" or \"partially mobile\" protonation conditions. The observation of these rearrangement reactions and/or the lack of product ions that provided definitive evidence for the correct site of phosphorylation, limited the ability to unambiguously assign the correct site of phosphorylation to only 12 of the 33 peptides (36%). Furthermore, the observation of competing fragmentation reactions for the neutral loss of 98 Da from these precursor ions (i.e., the loss of H(3)PO(4) versus the combined losses of HPO(3) and H(2)O) indicates that CID-MS(3) of [M + nH - 98](n+) ions may not be used for unambiguous phosphorylation site localization.","PMID":19012417,"authors":[{"lastName":"Palumbo","initials":"AM","foreName":"Amanda M"},{"lastName":"Reid","initials":"GE","foreName":"Gavin E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14249,"articleTitle":"Combination of biodegradable organic matter quantification and XAD-fractionation as effective working parameter for the study of biodegradability in environmental and anthropic samples.","dateCreated":"2009-01-05","dateRevised":"2009-01-05","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-1298","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Chemosphere","isoAbbreviation":"Chemosphere"},"articleDate":"2008-11-08","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The present work proposes to couple quantification of biodegradable organic matter (BOM) with XAD-fractionation.

The DOM fractions exhibited different changes in Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra characteristics during SAT. Biodegradation resulted in the enrichment of aromatic structures and the decreased content of the oxygen-containing functional groups, such as CO and C-O, in DOM.

New, robust methods are required for the detection of reduced P compounds in order to confirm the importance of these species in the overall cycling of P in the environment. To this end, we have developed new batch and flow injection (FI) methods for the determination of P(+III) in aqueous solutions. The batch method is based on the reaction of P(+III) with a mixed-iodide solution containing tri-iodide (I(3)(-)) and penta-iodide (I(5)(-)). The oxidation of P(+III) consumes free I(3)(-) and I(5)(-) in solution. The remaining I(3)(-) and I(5)(-) subunits are then allowed to react with the amylose content in starch to form a blue complex, which has a lambda(max) of 580 nm. The measurement of this blue complex is directly correlated with the concentration of P(+III). The on-line FI method employs the same reaction between P(+III) and mixed-iodide producing phosphate [P(+V)] that is determined spectrophotometrically by the molybdenum blue method employing ascorbic acid at a lambda(max) of 710 nm. The linear range for both the batch and FI determination of P(+III) was 1.0-50 microM with detection limits of 0.70 and 0.36 microM, respectively. Interference studies for the batch method show that arsenite [As(+III)] and sulfite [S(+IV)] can also be determined by this technique; however, these interferences can be circumvented by oxidizing As(+III) and S(+IV) using KMnO(4) which is an ineffective oxidant for P(+III). Both methods were applied to P(+III) determinations in ultra-pure water and simulated creek water. Results and analytical figures of merit are reported and future work is considered.","PMID":18970717,"authors":[{"lastName":"Barco","initials":"RA","foreName":"Roman A"},{"lastName":"Patil","initials":"DG","foreName":"Deepa G"},{"lastName":"Xu","initials":"W","foreName":"Weihong"},{"lastName":"Ke","initials":"L","foreName":"Lin"},{"lastName":"Khachikian","initials":"CS","foreName":"Crist S"},{"lastName":"Hanrahan","initials":"G","foreName":"Grady"},{"lastName":"Salmassi","initials":"TM","foreName":"Tina M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14182,"articleTitle":"A newly synthesized macrocyclic dithioxamide receptor for phosphate sensing.","dateCreated":"2008-10-30","dateRevised":"2008-10-30","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3573","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Talanta","isoAbbreviation":"Talanta"},"articleDate":"2006-01-10","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based membranes using macrocyclic dithioxamide receptor (I) derived from isophthaloyl dichloride and dithioxamide have been prepared and explored as HPO(4)(2-)-selective sensors.

Using classical agar plating techniques for screening planting material for contamination has not been very successful because of the lack of a reliable semiselective agar medium. The pathogen grows slowly on general plating media and is easily overgrown by saprophytic bacteria during isolation from diseased plants. In an effort to develop a semiselective medium, the utilization of several carbon and nitrogen sources was studied. Results of these tests provided information used to design a basal medium allowing good growth of the target organism while suppressing growth of several common saprophytes. Additional selectivity was achieved by incorporating three antibiotics into the basal medium. The new semiselective agar medium, designated cefazolin trehalose agar (CTA) medium, contained (per liter) 3.0 g of K(2)HPO(4), 1.0 g of NaH(2)PO(4), 0.3 g of MgSO(4).7H(2)O, 1.0 g of NH(4)Cl, 9.0 g of D(+)-trehalose, 1.0 D(+)-glucose, 1.0 g of yeast extract, 0.025 g of cefazolin, 0.0012 g of lincomycin, 0.0025 g of phosphomycin, 0.25 g of cycloheximide, and 14.0 g of agar. In comparison to a starch-based semiselective medium (SXM), plating efficiencies using pure cultures of 10 strains of X. campestris pv. manihotis were significantly higher on CTA, with an average of 85 and 50%, respectively. Likewise, isolation and recovery of X. campestris pv. manihotis from infected cassava leaves and contaminated soil were much higher on CTA than on SXM agar. When X. campestris pv. manihotis occurs in high concentrations in diseased tissue, the standard yeast trehalose glucose agar medium supplemented with 250 mug of cycloheximide per ml appears to be satisfactory. The newly developed CTA medium should prove useful for control strategies to identify and remove infected planting material of cassava, as well as for basic ecological studies of the pathogen.","PMID":18944695,"authors":[{"lastName":"Fessehaie","initials":"A","foreName":"A"},{"lastName":"Wydra","initials":"K","foreName":"K"},{"lastName":"Rudolph","initials":"K","foreName":"K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14175,"articleTitle":"Phosphite Inhibits Development of the Nematodes Heterodera avenae and Meloidogyne marylandi in Cereals.","dateCreated":"2008-10-23","dateRevised":"2008-10-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"0031-949X","issnType":"Print","title":"Phytopathology","isoAbbreviation":"Phytopathology"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"ABSTRACT Phosphonic acid (H(3)PO(3)) solutions were applied to wheat or to bristle oat as soil drenches before inoculation with juveniles of the sedentary, endoparasitic nematodes Heterodera avenae or Meloidogyne marylandi.

First, by EDXRF screening, the presence or absence of element Cr was established. Spot test was followed to identify the valent state of chromium because Cr(6+) and Cr(3+) normally coexist. After alkali digestion, Cr(VI) was separated without an undersired Cr(VI)-Cr(III) interconversions. With a color reagent (DPC) to chelated with Cr(VI), the solution was finally detected by a UV-vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 540 nm which is the basis of analyzing Cr(VI) quantitatively. Some parameters affecting analyses were studied. It was found that when pH in the final solution was 2.0, the extraction time was 60 min, the extraction temperature was 90 degrees C, pH during the extraction process was 7.5-8.5, and a mixed buffer solution (0.5M K(2)HPO(4)/0.5M KH(2)PO(4)) was added up to 1 ml, colorimetric reagent was added to 2 ml, it is optimal for extraction.

Upon its inactivation, an excess of cells is produced. These additional cells are generated from an increased rate of cell division, followed by inappropriate proliferation of cells that have failed to exit the cell cycle. We analyzed the consequence of inactivation of the entire E2F family of transcription factors in these two settings. In Drosophila, there is a single activator, dE2F1, and a single repressor, dE2F2, which act antagonistically to each other during development. While the loss of the activator dE2F1 results in a severe impairment in cell proliferation, this defect is rescued by the simultaneous loss of the repressor dE2F2, as cell proliferation occurs relatively normally in the absence of both dE2F proteins. We found that the combined inactivation of dE2F1 and dE2F2 had no significant effect on the increased rate of cell division of Hippo pathway mutant cells. In striking contrast, inappropriate proliferation of cells that failed to exit the cell cycle was efficiently blocked. Furthermore, our data suggest that such inappropriate proliferation was primarily dependent on the activator, de2f1, as loss of de2f2 was inconsequential. Consistently, Hippo pathway mutant cells had elevated E2F activity and induced dE2F1 expression at a point when wild-type cells normally exit the cell cycle. Thus, we uncovered a critical requirement for the dE2F family during inappropriate proliferation of Hippo pathway mutant cells.","PMID":18833298,"authors":[{"lastName":"Nicolay","initials":"BN","foreName":"Brandon N"},{"lastName":"Frolov","initials":"MV","foreName":"Maxim V"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14195,"articleTitle":"Development of an early biomarker for the ovarian liability of selective estrogen receptor modulators in rats.","dateCreated":"2008-11-12","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0960-0760","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

However, SERMs also increase the risk of developing ovarian cysts in this population, a phenomenon that is not seen in postmenopausal women. It is believed that current SERMs partially block estradiol's ability to downregulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus thereby interfering with estradiol's negative feedback, leading to increased ovarian stimulation by gonadotropins, and cyst formation. It has been postulated that a SERM with poor brain exposure would have less negative effect on the HPO axis, therefore reducing the risk of developing ovarian cysts. In order to test this hypothesis, we identified an early marker of SERM-dependent ovarian effects: upregulation of Cyp17a1 mRNA. SERMs known to cause ovarian cysts upregulate Cyp17a1 after only 4 days of dosing and suppression of the HPO axis prevented this regulation, indicating that ovarian expression of Cyp17a1 was secondary to SERM's effect on the brain. We then characterized three SERMs with similar binding affinity and antagonist effects on the uterus for their relative brain/plasma exposure and ovarian effects. We found that the degree of brain exposure correlated very well with Cyp17a1 expression.","PMID":18824103,"authors":[{"lastName":"Harris","initials":"HA","foreName":"Heather A"},{"lastName":"Chennathukuzhi","initials":"VM","foreName":"Vargheese M"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaochun"},{"lastName":"Mekonnen","initials":"B","foreName":"Belew"},{"lastName":"Jelinsky","initials":"SA","foreName":"Scott A"},{"lastName":"Schelling","initials":"SH","foreName":"Scott H"},{"lastName":"Patel","initials":"VS","foreName":"Vikram S"},{"lastName":"Huselton","initials":"C","foreName":"Christine"},{"lastName":"Negahban","initials":"A","foreName":"Andre"},{"lastName":"Azam","initials":"F","foreName":"Farooq"},{"lastName":"Winneker","initials":"RC","foreName":"Richard C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14153,"articleTitle":"Boundaries of Dachsous Cadherin activity modulate the Hippo signaling pathway to induce cell proliferation.","dateCreated":"2008-10-01","dateRevised":"2014-09-03","publication":{"issnNumber":"1091-6490","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","isoAbbreviation":"Proc.

To date a signal transduction cascade from the Cadherin Fat at the plasma membrane into the nucleus has been discovered. However, how the Hippo pathway is regulated by extracellular signals is poorly understood. Fat not only regulates growth but also planar cell polarity, for which it interacts with the Dachsous (Ds) Cadherin, and Four-jointed (Fj), a transmembrane kinase that modulates the interaction between Ds and Fat. Ds and Fj are expressed in gradients and manipulation of their expression causes abnormal growth. However, how Ds and Fj regulate growth and whether they act through the Hippo pathway is not known. Here, we report that Ds and Fj regulate Hippo signaling to control growth. Interestingly, we found that Ds/Fj regulate the Hippo pathway through a remarkable logic. Induction of Hippo target genes is not proportional to the amount of Ds or Fj presented to a cell, as would be expected if Ds and Fj acted as traditional ligands. Rather, Hippo target genes are up-regulated when neighboring cells express different amounts of Ds or Fj. Consistent with a model that differences in Ds/Fj levels between cells regulate the Hippo pathway, we found that artificial Ds/Fj boundaries induce extra cell proliferation, whereas flattening the endogenous Ds and Fj gradients results in growth defects. The Ds/Fj signaling system thus defines a cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that regulates the Hippo pathway, thereby contributing to the control of organ size.","PMID":18809931,"authors":[{"lastName":"Willecke","initials":"M","foreName":"Maria"},{"lastName":"Hamaratoglu","initials":"F","foreName":"Fisun"},{"lastName":"Sansores-Garcia","initials":"L","foreName":"Leticia"},{"lastName":"Tao","initials":"C","foreName":"Chunyao"},{"lastName":"Halder","initials":"G","foreName":"Georg"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14260,"articleTitle":"Effect of PEG amount in amorphous calcium phosphate on its crystallized products.","dateCreated":"2009-01-16","dateRevised":"2017-10-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0957-4530","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of materials science.

Comparing the transperitoneal removal of electrolytes by conventional PD solutions (CPDSs) with that by normal kidneys, it is evident that peritoneal removal is in the lower range of what can be considered \"normal.\" Given the electrolyte composition of CPDSs and a total dwell volume of 4 exchanges of 2 L each, approximately 90 mmol NaCl, 40 mmol K(+), 10 - 15 mmol HPO(4)(-) and 1 - 2 mmol Ca(2+) can be removed daily [plus 1 L ultrafiltration (UF)]. Na(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+) are supplied in CPDSs in concentrations close to their plasma concentrations, which makes their removal almost entirely dependent on UF. In UF failure (UFF), plasma levels of the foregoing ions will tend to rise, producing a higher diffusion gradient to compensate for their defective UF removal. Peritoneal removal of HCO(3)(-), HPO(4)(-), and K(+) are usually quite efficient because of the zero CPDS concentrations of these ions. Approximately 150 mmol HCO(3)(-) is lost daily with CPDSs, compensated for by the addition of 30 - 40 mmol/L lactate, or, with the use of multi-compartment bags, bicarbonate instead. However, a mixture of bicarbonate and lactate should be preferred as a buffer, to avoid intracellular acidosis from high levels of pCO(2) in the dialysis fluid. For patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) without UFF and with some residual renal function, PD fluid concentrations of Na(+) 130 - 133 mmol/L, Ca(2+) 1.25 - 1.35 mmol/L, and Mg(2+) 0.25 - 0.3 mmol/L seem appropriate. With reduced UF after a few years of PD, the removal of fluid and electrolytes often becomes deficient. Dietary salt restriction can be prescribed, but it is hard to implement. The use of low-Na(+) solution (LNa) is a potential alternative. The reduction in osmolality resulting from Na(+) removal in LNa should preferably be compensated by the addition of glucose (G). In a recent study, a regimen including 1 LNa exchange daily (Na(+) 115 mmol/L) in a G-compensated solution showed very promising effects on blood pressure and fluid status. However, large-scale randomized controlled studies have to be performed to definitively settle the role of LNa in volume-overloaded patients.","PMID":18552243,"authors":[{"lastName":"Rippe","initials":"B","foreName":"Bengt"},{"lastName":"Venturoli","initials":"D","foreName":"Daniele"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14195,"articleTitle":"Optimization of culture medium for the production of phenyllactic acid by Lactobacillus sp.

However, knowledge of how salts modulate the physical properties of amorphous solid sugars, a major component in these systems, is lacking. We have used phosphorescence of the triplet probe erythrosin B (Ery B) to monitor molecular mobility in amorphous sucrose films (dried against P(2)O(5)) containing the salts NaCl, MgCl(2), CaCl(2), NaAcetate, Na(3)Citrate, NaH(2)PO(4), or Na(2)HPO(4) at a mole ratio of 0.2:1 (salt/sucrose). All the salts examined, except NaH(2)PO(4), significantly increased the phosphorescence lifetime of Ery B over the temperature range from 5 to 100 degrees C. This increase is due to a reduction in the rate of collisional quenching of the triplet state due to interactions with the matrix, indicating that these salts decreased the matrix molecular mobility. NaAcetate, Na(3)Citrate, and Na(2)HPO(4) decreased mobility more than NaCl, CaCl(2), or MgCl(2), perhaps due to specific hydrogen bonding interactions between the anion and sucrose. Systematic variations in the probe emission lifetime across the excitation and emission bands at 25 degrees C indicate that there are sites of different mobilities within amorphous solid sucrose; this dynamic site heterogeneity was enhanced in the presence of the divalent cationic salts MgCl(2) and CaCl(2). These results suggest that salts may play a significant role in modulating the mobility, and thus the long-term stability, of amorphous biological matrixes.","PMID":18771764,"authors":[{"lastName":"You","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yumin"},{"lastName":"Ludescher","initials":"RD","foreName":"Richard D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14125,"articleTitle":"Nano-beta-tricalcium phosphates synthesis and biodegradation: 1.

We have shown that in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the complex formation between transcriptional co-activators YAPs (Yes kinase-associated proteins) and Lats kinases requires the intact WW domains of YAPs, as well as intact Pro-Pro-AA-Tyr (where AA is any amino acid) motifs in Lats kinases. These kinases cooperate with the upstream Mst2 kinase to phosphorylate YAPs at Ser-127. Overexpression of YAP2 in HEK293 cells promoted apoptosis, whereas the Mst2/Lats1-induced phosphorylation of YAP partially rescued the cells from apoptotic death. Apoptotic signaling of YAP2 was mediated via stabilization of p73, which formed a complex with YAP2. All components of the Hippo pathway that we studied were localized in the cytoplasm, with the exception of YAP, which also localized in the nucleus. The localization of YAP2 in the nucleus was negatively controlled by the Lats1 kinase.

Organic matter in the secondary effluent from the Wenchang Wastewater Treatment Plant (Harbin, China) was physically separated into the following fractions: particulate organic carbon (1.2-0.45 microm), colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.1 microm), fine colloidal organic carbon (0.1-0.025 microm), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (< 0.025 microm). Moreover, < 0.45 microm fraction was chemically separated into hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N), and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The chlorine reactivity of these organic fractions obtained from both size and XAD fractionations were evaluated.

There is a tendency among parents and clinicians to view oligo-amenorrhea as a normal variant in the teen years. In fact, the 95th percentile for the time interval between cycles is 90 days. Thus, it is abnormal for an adolescent to be amenorrheic for greater than 3 months, even in the early gynecologic years. Identification of abnormal menstrual patterns throughout adolescence may permit early identification of potential health concerns for adulthood. Few problems in gynecologic endocrinology are as complex or challenging to the clinician as amenorrhea. However, thorough evaluation of menstrual cycle disorders in adolescence provides a window of opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Here we discuss a systematic approach to the evaluation and treatment of amenorrhea in adolescents who do not have androgen excess. There is strong evidence that estrogen deficiency is a risk factor for later development of osteoporosis and hip fracture. Delay in the evaluation and treatment of disordered menses in some cases may contribute to reduced bone density. Both patients and clinicians need to view the ovary as an important endocrine organ that helps maintain health, especially bone health.","PMID":18574207,"authors":[{"lastName":"Popat","initials":"VB","foreName":"Vaishali B"},{"lastName":"Prodanov","initials":"T","foreName":"Tamara"},{"lastName":"Calis","initials":"KA","foreName":"Karim A"},{"lastName":"Nelson","initials":"LM","foreName":"Lawrence M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14053,"articleTitle":"Optimization of fermentation medium and conditions for mycelial growth and water-soluble exo-polysaccharides production by Isaria farinosa B05.","dateCreated":"2008-06-23","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1532-2297","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology","isoAbbreviation":"Prep.

The therapy of choice is complete surgical resection. There are no data supporting a neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

EfOM constituents were sequentially removed, first by removing particles down to the approximate ultrafilter pore size and then by removing dissolved EfOM based on functionality. Particles and colloids >20nm accounted for 19% of total organic carbon (TOC), including 96% of EfOM >100kDa. Removal of particles and colloids resulted in increased fouling, attributed to increased contact of dissolved EfOM with the membrane. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic (HPO/HPI) acids were 22% of total EfOM, and accounted for nearly all of the fouling. HPO/HPI base/neutrals were 59% of EfOM, but did not cause any significant fouling. Although HPO/HPI base/neutrals did not cause any fouling, they were the dominant EfOM constituent at the surface of fouled and then hydraulically cleaned membranes, as measured by attenuated reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Since the filtration runs were short, the effects of HPO/HPI base/neutrals on long-term fouling should be further investigated, but these results cast doubt on the presumption that organic materials that are identified during membrane autopsies are necessarily a primary cause of fouling. These results also indicate that wastewater EfOM should be treated to remove HPO/HPI acids prior to membrane filtration.","PMID":18534655,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kim","initials":"HC","foreName":"Hyun-Chul"},{"lastName":"Dempsey","initials":"BA","foreName":"Brian A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14022,"articleTitle":"The physical and cytological properties of white MTA mixed with Na2HPO4 as an accelerant.","dateCreated":"2008-05-23","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1878-3554","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of endodontics","isoAbbreviation":"J Endod"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the physicochemical and cytologic properties of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) mixed with distilled water and Na(2)HPO(4) buffer solution.

Those in the HPO fraction (14C age of 5100 year) are very similar to much younger freshwater fulvic acids, but less aromatic and more oxygenated molecules are more frequent. This trend continues toward the HPI fraction and may indicate biotic and abiotic aging processes that this material experienced since its primary production thousands of years ago. In the HPI fraction series of nitrogenous molecules containing one, two, or three nitrogens were identified by FTICR-MS. Production spectra of the nitrogenous molecules suggest that the nitrogen atoms in these molecules are included in the (alicyclic) backbone of these molecules, possibly in reduced form.

Disruption of the Hippo pathway, including major components Hippo, Salvador, and Warts, results in aberrant follicle-cell differentiation and proliferation and dramatic disruption of the oocyte anterior-posterior axis. These phenotypes are related to defective Notch signaling in follicle cells, because misexpression of a constitutively active form of Notch alleviates the oocyte polarity defects. We also find that follicle cells defective in Hippo signaling accumulate the Notch receptor and display defects in endocytosis markers.

Acid and acid-thermal treatments were employed to treat the raw red mud. The effects of different treatment methods, pH of solution and operating temperature on adsorption have been examined in batch experiments. It was found that all activated red mud samples show higher surface area and total pore volume as well as higher adsorption capacity for phosphate removal. The red mud with HCl treatment shows the highest adsorption capacity among all the red mud samples, giving adsorption capacity of 0.58 mg P/g at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C. The adsorption capacity of the red mud adsorbents decreases with increase of pH. At pH 2, the red mud with HCl treatment exhibits adsorption of 0.8 mg P/g while the adsorption can be lowered to 0.05 mg P/g at pH 10. However, the adsorption is improved at higher temperature by increasing 25% from 30 to 40 degrees C. The kinetic studies of phosphate adsorption onto red mud indicate that the adsorption mainly follows the parallel first-order kinetics due to the presence of two acidic phosphorus species, H(2)PO(4)(-) and HPO(4)(2-).

SD physically interacts with the product of the vestigial (vg) gene, where the dimer functions as a master gene controlling wing formation [3, 4]. The VG-SD dimer activates the transcription of several specific wing genes, including sd and vg themselves [5, 6]. The dimer drives cell-cycle progression by inducing expression of the dE2F1 transcription factor [7], which regulates genes involved in DNA replication and cell-cycle progression. Recently, YORKIE (YKI) was identified as a transcriptional coactivator that is the downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which controls cell proliferation and apoptosis in Drosophila[8]. We identified SD as a partner for YKI. We show that interaction between YKI and SD increases SD transcriptional activity both ex vivo in Drosophila S2 cells and in vivo in Drosophila wing discs and promotes YKI nuclear localization. We also show that YKI overexpression induces vg and dE2F1 expression and that proliferation induced by YKI or by a dominant-negative form of FAT in wing disc is significantly reduced in a sd hypomorphic mutant context. Contrary to YKI, SD is not required in all imaginal tissues. This indicates that YKI-SD interaction acts in a tissue-specific fashion and that other YKI partners must exist.","PMID":18313299,"authors":[{"lastName":"Goulev","initials":"Y","foreName":"Youlian"},{"lastName":"Fauny","initials":"JD","foreName":"Jean Daniel"},{"lastName":"Gonzalez-Marti","initials":"B","foreName":"Beatriz"},{"lastName":"Flagiello","initials":"D","foreName":"Domenico"},{"lastName":"Silber","initials":"J","foreName":"Joël"},{"lastName":"Zider","initials":"A","foreName":"Alain"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14235,"articleTitle":"Effect of borate glass composition on its conversion to hydroxyapatite and on the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells.","dateCreated":"2008-12-22","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1552-4965","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Journal of biomedical materials research.

The evolution of the reaction was followed by DTA, XRD, FTIR and SEM techniques. An enhanced reactivity of the mixtures was detected as the mechanochemical treatment times increased. This effect was related to both the loss of crystallinity of the reactants and the production of defects on their surfaces. 6 h of mechanochemical processing at 1190 rpm, followed by 3 h of thermal treatment at 1500 degrees C, were enough to obtain pure TTCP. The crystallinity and purity of the obtained TTCP were checked by XRD and FTIR. The morphologic characteristics were analyzed by SEM and BET analysis. The behavior of synthesized TTCP powder in combination with commercial dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA, CaHPO(4)), as the solid phase of bone cements, was tested. Both the combination of different particle sizes of TTCP and DCPA and the effect of different kinds of accelerator agents (disodium hydrogen phosphate, tartaric acid, citric acid and oxalic acid) on setting time and degree of conversion to hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca(10)(PO(4))(6)(OH)(2)) were evaluated. The combination of TTCP (0.32 m(2)/g) with DCPA (1.52 m(2)/g), in a 1/1 molar ratio, showed the shortest setting times and high conversions to HA when an oxalic acid solution (5% volume fraction) was used as the liquid phase of the formulation. Results obtained from this work demonstrated that synthesized TTCP shows promising behavior as a component of bone cements, exhibiting not only a smaller particle size than that usually reported but also a low degree of crystallinity, all of which increases the reactivity of the obtained TTCP.

High As groundwaters generally occur in the shallow alluvial-lacustrine aquifers, which are mainly composed of black (or dark grey) fine sands in a reducing environment. They are characterized by high concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, HCO(3)(-), P and S(2-), and low concentrations of NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-). Low SO(4)(2-) coupled with high S(2-) suggests that SO(4)(2-) reduction has been an active process. In the reducing groundwaters, inorganic As(III) accounts for around 75% of total dissolved As. Total As contents in the sediments from three representative boreholes are observed to be 7.3-73.3 mg/kg (average of 18.9 mg/kg). The total As is mildly-strongly correlated with total Fe and total Mn, while a quite weak correlation exists between total As and total S, suggesting that the As is associated with Fe-Mn oxides, rather than sulfides in the sediments. It is found in the sequential extraction that chemically active As is mainly bound to Fe-Mn oxides, up to 3500 microg/kg. The mobilization of As under reducing conditions is believed to include reductive dissolution of Fe-Mn oxides and reduction of adsorbed As. Although exchangeable As is labile and very vulnerable to hydrogeochemical condition, the contribution is relatively limited due to the low concentrations. The competition between As and other anions (such as HPO(4)(2-)) for binding sites on Fe-Mn oxides may also give rise to the release of As into groundwater. Slow groundwater movement helps accumulation of the released As in the groundwaters.","PMID":18234287,"authors":[{"lastName":"Guo","initials":"H","foreName":"Huaming"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"S","foreName":"Suzhen"},{"lastName":"Tang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaohui"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuan"},{"lastName":"Shen","initials":"Z","foreName":"Zhaoli"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13920,"articleTitle":"Synthesis and crystal structure of thorium bis(hydrogenphosphate) monohydrate.","dateCreated":"2008-02-11","dateRevised":"2008-02-11","publication":{"issnNumber":"0020-1669","issnType":"Print","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2008-01-26","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Microcrystals of Th(HPO 4) 2.H 2O were hydrothermally obtained from a Th(NO 3) 4-CO(NH 2) 2-H 3PO 3-H 2O system ( T = 180 masculineC).

This reduced oxidation state phosphorus originated from extraterrestrial material that fell during the heavy bombardment period or was produced during impacts, and persisted in the mildly reducing atmosphere. This alternate view of early Earth phosphorus geochemistry provides an unexplored route to the formation of pertinent prebiotic phosphorus compounds, suggests a facile reaction pathway to condensed phosphates, and is consistent with the biochemical usage of reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds in life today.

In the acidic soil, Pb-P reactions promoted further soil acidification, improved TCLP performance, and generated better agreement with the equilibrium-based model; however, SPLP and modeling results showed that Pb concentrations could not be reduced below 15 microg/L mainly due to the low soil pH. The marginal or inadequate Pb immobilization was observed in both soils despite the elevated MCP dosages, which were well in excess of the pyromorphite stoichiometric ratio (P/Pb = 0.6).

However, there has been disagreement as to the nature of the links among Fat, Expanded, and Warts and the significance of these links to growth control. We report here that mutations in either expanded or fat can be rescued to viability simply by overexpressing Warts, indicating that their essential function is their influence on Warts rather than reported effects on endocytosis or other pathways. These rescue experiments also separate the transcriptional from the planar cell polarity branches of Fat signaling and reveal that Expanded does not directly affect polarity. We also investigate the relationship between expanded and fat and show, contrary to prior reports, that they have additive effects on imaginal disk growth and development. Although mutation of fat can cause partial loss of Expanded protein from the membrane, mutation of fat promotes growth even when Expanded is overexpressed and accumulates at its normal subapical location. These observations argue against recent proposals that Fat acts simply as a receptor for the Hippo signaling pathway and instead support the proposal that Fat and Expanded can act in parallel to regulate Warts through distinct mechanisms.","PMID":18077345,"authors":[{"lastName":"Feng","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yongqiang"},{"lastName":"Irvine","initials":"KD","foreName":"Kenneth D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13902,"articleTitle":"Production of L-phenylacetylcarbinol by microbial transformation in polyethylene glycol-induced cloud point system.","dateCreated":"2008-01-24","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0175-7598","issnType":"Print","title":"Applied microbiology and biotechnology","isoAbbreviation":"Appl.

Interestingly, the presence of DNA improved the activity and stability of the bound enzymes. Key studies leading to the current strategy are presented initially, and these are followed by more recent developments. Several enzymes and proteins, including horseradish peroxidase, lysozyme, glucose oxidase, chymotrypsin, bovine serum albumin, cytochrome c, met-hemoglobin and met-myoglobin are successfully intercalated in the galleries of alpha-ZrP, under benign ambient conditions (aqueous buffered solutions, at room temperature and neutral pH). These novel materials are characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM as well as by biochemical, calorimetric and spectroscopic methods. Spectroscopic studies (circular dichroism, CD), for example, indicated that co-intercalation of DNA improved the retention of bound enzyme structure. The activity was enhanced markedly (five-fold) when DNA is co-intercalated, when compared to the activity in the absence of DNA. Addition of DNA to the sample, after enzyme intercalation, did not make any improvements. Our hypothesis is that enzyme-DNA supramolecular complex binds to the solid and the unfavorable interactions between the enzyme and the solid are minimized.

Furthermore, attenuation of this phosphorylation of YAP or Yorkie (Yki), the Drosophila homolog of YAP, potentiates their growth-promoting function in vivo. Moreover, YAP overexpression regulates gene expression in a manner opposite to cell density, and is able to overcome cell contact inhibition. Inhibition of YAP function restores contact inhibition in a human cancer cell line bearing deletion of Salvador (Sav), a Hippo pathway component. Interestingly, we observed that YAP protein is elevated and nuclear localized in some human liver and prostate cancers. Our observations demonstrate that YAP plays a key role in the Hippo pathway to control cell proliferation in response to cell contact.","PMID":17974916,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"B","foreName":"Bin"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaomu"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"W","foreName":"Weiquan"},{"lastName":"Udan","initials":"RS","foreName":"Ryan S"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qian"},{"lastName":"Kim","initials":"J","foreName":"Joungmok"},{"lastName":"Xie","initials":"J","foreName":"Joe"},{"lastName":"Ikenoue","initials":"T","foreName":"Tsuneo"},{"lastName":"Yu","initials":"J","foreName":"Jindan"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"L","foreName":"Li"},{"lastName":"Zheng","initials":"P","foreName":"Pan"},{"lastName":"Ye","initials":"K","foreName":"Keqiang"},{"lastName":"Chinnaiyan","initials":"A","foreName":"Arul"},{"lastName":"Halder","initials":"G","foreName":"Georg"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"ZC","foreName":"Zhi-Chun"},{"lastName":"Guan","initials":"KL","foreName":"Kun-Liang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14229,"articleTitle":"A rapid and sensitive immunonanogold resonance scattering spectral probe for complement 3.","dateCreated":"2008-12-16","dateRevised":"2008-12-16","publication":{"issnNumber":"1873-3573","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Talanta","isoAbbreviation":"Talanta"},"articleDate":"2007-05-24","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Gold nanoparticles in size of about 10nm was used to label goat anti-human complement 3 (anti-C3) to obtain a sensitive and selective immunoresonance scattering spectral probe for C3.

Decreased SWH pathway activity gives rise to excess proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The core of the SWH network is composed of two serine/threonine kinases Hippo (Hpo) and Warts (Wts), the scaffold proteins Salvador (Sav) and Mats, and the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) [1]. Two band 4.1 related proteins, Merlin (Mer) and Expanded (Ex), have been proposed to act upstream of Hpo, which in turn activates Wts ([1] for review). Wts phosphorylates and inhibits Yki, repressing the expression of Yki target genes [2-4]. Recently, several planar cell polarity (PCP) genes have been implicated in the SWH network in growth control [5-8]. Here, we show that, during oogenesis, the core components of the SWH network are required in posterior follicle cells (PFCs) competent to receive the Gurken (Grk)/TGFalpha signal emitted by the oocyte to control body axis formation. Our results suggest that the SWH network controls the expression of Hindsight, the downstream effector of Notch, required for follicle cell mitotic cycle-endocycle switch. The PCP members of the SWH network are not involved in this process, indicating that signaling upstream of Hpo varies according to developmental context.","PMID":17964162,"authors":[{"lastName":"Polesello","initials":"C","foreName":"Cédric"},{"lastName":"Tapon","initials":"N","foreName":"Nicolas"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13823,"articleTitle":"The salvador-warts-hippo pathway is required for epithelial proliferation and axis specification in Drosophila.","dateCreated":"2007-11-06","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"0960-9822","issnType":"Print","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

The enhancement of the composting process will shorten the operation time and thus reduce the composting space and production costs. In this work, a microbial inoculum originated from the MSW leachate was used for the enhancement of the biodegradation of organic fractions of MSW (namely OFMSW hereinafter) in the composting process. The leachate generated from OFMSW composting was cultivated in the presence of foreign nutritions of beef extract, peptone, K(2)HPO(4) and CaCO(3), respectively. The rough microbial inoculum was then harvested from the cultivated leachate and employed for the enhancement of OFMSW composting. One percent of the rough inoculum was mixed with 99% of the organic wastes (on wet basis). When the composting process proceeded at Day 7, the leachate thus generated was re-cultivated with the said nutrition and introduced into fresh organic wastes for another 7-day composting; repeating this step and the final generated leachate (namely final inoculum) was used for the fresh organic waste composting process. Seeding effects in terms of composting parameters (temperature, oxygen uptake rate, pH, cellulase, microbial numbers, moisture content, and nitrogen concentrations) were tested and the data were collected as reported in this paper. It was found that the temperature in the composting system seeded with the final inoculum could reach over 55 degrees C for the duration of over 96 h, and the numbers of thermophilic bacteria, actinomyces and molds in the refuse, increased by approximately 100%, 70% and 50%, respectively, after a 20-day primary composting. pH maintained at 7.0 with slight fluctuation, thus facilitating the microbial behaviors of cellulose depletion. Meanwhile, the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and cellulase activity was observed to increase by some 50% and 26%, respectively. The development trend of nitrogen concentrations also indicated that the microorganisms in the final inoculum had the ability to endure the extreme temperature of 70 degrees C. Hence, it can be concluded that the final inoculum developed with leachate recirculated cultivation can work well, benefited from the indigenous communities present to efficiently accelerate the OFMSW composting process.","PMID":17959305,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ming","initials":"L","foreName":"Li"},{"lastName":"Xuya","initials":"P","foreName":"Peng"},{"lastName":"Youcai","initials":"Z","foreName":"Zhao"},{"lastName":"Wenchuan","initials":"D","foreName":"Ding"},{"lastName":"Huashuai","initials":"C","foreName":"Cai"},{"lastName":"Guotao","initials":"L","foreName":"Liu"},{"lastName":"Zhengsong","initials":"W","foreName":"Wu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13804,"articleTitle":"Progestogens versus oestrogens and progestogens for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation.","dateCreated":"2007-10-18","dateRevised":"2013-06-28","publication":{"issnNumber":"1469-493X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","isoAbbreviation":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev"},"articleDate":"2007-10-17","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is excessively heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding of uterine origin which is not due to pregnancy or to recognisable pelvic or systemic disease. Anovulation may be inferred from a number of observations but, in the normal clinical situation, anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding, particularly in those who are at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) oestrogen production there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used varies widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone and oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 4 May 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (1985 to May 2007), CINAHL (1982 to May 2007), Biological Abstracts (1969 to May 2007), Current Contents (1980 to 2007) and reference lists of articles.All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors.

One randomised study compared the effects of two progestogens on endometrial histology in women with a variety of menstrual symptoms, half of whom had cystic glandular hyperplasia.There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.

These chelators, although effective at decreasing the iron load, are associated with a number of side effects. Grady suggested that the combined administration of a smaller bidentate chelator and a larger hexadentate chelator, such as DFO, would result in greater iron removal than either chelator alone [Grady, Bardoukas and Giardina (1998) Blood 92, 16b]. This in turn could lead to a decrease in the chelator dose required. To test this hypothesis, the rate of iron transfer from a range of bidentate HPO (hydroxypyridin-4-one) chelators to DFO was monitored. Spectroscopic methods were utilized to monitor the decrease in the concentration of the Fe-HPO complex. Having established that the shuttling of iron from the bidentate chelator to DFO does occur under clinically relevant concentrations of chelator, studies were undertaken to evaluate whether this mechanism of transfer would apply to iron removal from transferrin. Again, the simultaneous presence of both a bidentate chelator and DFO was found to enhance the rate of iron chelation from transferrin at clinically relevant chelator levels. Deferiprone was found to be particularly effective at 'shuttling' iron from transferrin to DFO, probably as a result of its small size and relative low affinity for iron compared with other analogous HPO chelators.","PMID":17919118,"authors":[{"lastName":"Devanur","initials":"LD","foreName":"Lakshmi D"},{"lastName":"Evans","initials":"RW","foreName":"Robert W"},{"lastName":"Evans","initials":"PJ","foreName":"Patricia J"},{"lastName":"Hider","initials":"RC","foreName":"Robert C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13781,"articleTitle":"[(CH3)2NH(CH2)2NH(CH3)2][(UO2)2F2(HPO4)2]: a new organically templated layered uranium phosphate fluoride--synthesis, structure, characterization, and ion-exchange reactions.","dateCreated":"2007-09-25","dateRevised":"2007-09-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"1477-9226","issnType":"Print","title":"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)","isoAbbreviation":"Dalton Trans"},"articleDate":"2007-06-20","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A new organically templated layered uranium phosphate fluoride, [(CH(3))(2)NH(CH(2))(2)NH(CH(3))(2)][(UO(2))(2)F(2)(HPO(4))(2)] has been synthesized by hydrothermal reaction of UO(3), H(3)PO(4), HF, and (CH(3))(2)NCH(2)CH(2)N(CH(3))(2) at 140 degrees C.

The sub-areas are characterized whether by their acidity (e.g. \"aged\" and \"non-aged\" phosphogypsum) or by their salt content, originating from pulping water during wet stacking or (after deposition) from the adjacent sea. Measurements in stack solutions and leachates showed that phosphogypsum characteristics affect both, the concentration and the chemical behavior of uranium in solution. Uranium concentration in solutions of increased salinity is up to three orders of magnitude higher than in solutions of low salinity and this is attributed to the effect of ionic strength on the solubility of phosphogypsum.

In Drosophila, these two processes are orchestrated by the Hippo kinase cascade, a growth-suppressive pathway that ultimately antagonizes the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Here we demonstrate that a single phosphorylation site in Yki mediates the growth-suppressive output of the Hippo pathway. Hippo-mediated phosphorylation inactivates Yki by excluding it from the nucleus, whereas loss of Hippo signaling leads to nuclear accumulation and therefore increased Yki activity.

Using a conditional YAP transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the mammalian Hippo pathway is a potent regulator of organ size, and that its dysregulation leads to tumorigenesis.

According to XRD, the phase composition of precipitated coatings on chemically pre-treated titanium after exposure to SBF was identified as hydroxy carbonated apatite (HCA).

Correct functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis is critical for ovulatory function, as well as the growth and differentiation of uterine tissue (myometrium and endometrium). However, the correct functioning of other endocrine glands (thyroid, adrenal cortex, pancreas) is also crucial for correct reproductive function. Genes and environmental factors have an influence on women's fertility through their effect on hormonal function. Consequently, dysfunction of the HPO axis and/or other endocrine systems may cause infertility and gynaecological disorders. The pathogenetic basis can be used to help make the correct clinical decision for treating these diseases. Disturbances related to the menstrual cycle, i.e. amenorrhoea, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), have a close correlation with hypo- or hypersecretion of hormones of the HPO axis. The roles of hypothalamic neurohormones and neurotransmitters in the various forms of amenorrhoea and PMS are well established. PCOS has a complex endocrine/metabolic origin, so a variety of hormonal treatments have been proposed. Hormone derangement has also been proposed as the cause of endometriosis and uterine fibroids. These disorders do not have hyper- or hyposecretion of reproductive hormones, but hyperactivity of oestrogen receptors coupled with a genetic predisposition. The relevance of the endocrine changes is confirmed by the clinical effectiveness of hormonal treatments. In order to establish the correct treatment approach in gynaecological disorders, it is important to understand the endocrine pathophysiology.","PMID":17804298,"authors":[{"lastName":"Petraglia","initials":"F","foreName":"Felice"},{"lastName":"Musacchio","initials":"C","foreName":"Concetta"},{"lastName":"Luisi","initials":"S","foreName":"Stefano"},{"lastName":"De Leo","initials":"V","foreName":"Vincenzo"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13808,"articleTitle":"Functional characterization of premnaspirodiene oxygenase, a cytochrome P450 catalyzing regio- and stereo-specific hydroxylations of diverse sesquiterpene substrates.","dateCreated":"2007-10-22","dateRevised":"2017-09-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9258","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of biological chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Mechanistically, these reactions could occur via a single, multifunctional cytochrome P450 or some combination of cytochrome P450s and a dehydrogenase. We report here the characterization of a single cytochrome P450 enzyme, Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (HPO), that catalyzes these successive reactions at carbon 2 (C-2) of the spirane substrate. HPO also catalyzes the equivalent regio-specific (C-2) hydroxylation of several eremophilane-type (decalin ring system) sesquiterpenes, such as with 5-epi-aristolochene. Moreover, HPO displays interesting comparisons to other sesquiterpene hydroxylases. 5-Epi-aristolochene di-hydroxylase (EAH) differs catalytically from HPO by introducing hydroxyl groups first at C-1, then C-3 of 5-epi-aristolochene. HPO and EAH also differ from one another by 91-amino acid differences, with four of these differences mapping to putative substrate recognition regions 5 and 6. These four positions were mutagenized alone and in various combinations in both HPO and EAH and the mutant enzymes were characterized for changes in substrate selectivity, reaction product specificity, and kinetic properties. These mutations did not alter the regio- or stereo-specificity of either HPO or EAH, but specific combinations of the mutations did improve the catalytic efficiencies 10-15-fold. Molecular models and comparisons between HPO and EAH provide insights into the catalytic properties of these enzymes of specialized metabolism in plants.","PMID":17715131,"authors":[{"lastName":"Takahashi","initials":"S","foreName":"Shunji"},{"lastName":"Yeo","initials":"YS","foreName":"Yun-Soo"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuxin"},{"lastName":"O'Maille","initials":"PE","foreName":"Paul E"},{"lastName":"Greenhagen","initials":"BT","foreName":"Bryan T"},{"lastName":"Noel","initials":"JP","foreName":"Joseph P"},{"lastName":"Coates","initials":"RM","foreName":"Robert M"},{"lastName":"Chappell","initials":"J","foreName":"Joe"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13991,"articleTitle":"An investigation of hemopexin redox properties by spectroelectrochemistry: biological relevance for heme uptake.","dateCreated":"2008-04-22","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0966-0844","issnType":"Print","title":"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine","isoAbbreviation":"Biometals"},"articleDate":"2007-08-22","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Hemopexin (HPX) has two principal roles: it sequesters free heme in vivo for the purpose of preventing the toxic effects of this moiety, which is largely due to heme's ability to catalyze free radical formation, and it transports heme intracellularly thus limiting its availability as an iron source for pathogens. Spectroelectrochemistry was used to determine the redox potential for heme and meso-heme (mH) when bound by HPX. At pH 7.2, the heme-HPX assembly exhibits E (1/2) values in the range 45-90 mV and the mH-HPX assembly in the range 5-55 mV, depending on environmental electrolyte identity. The E (1/2) value exhibits a 100 mV positive shift with a change in pH from 7.2 to 5.5 for mH-HPX, suggesting a single proton dependent equilibrium. The E (1/2) values for heme-HPX are more positive in the presence of NaCl than KCl indicating that Na(+), as well as low pH (5.5) stabilizes ferro-heme-HPX. Furthermore, comparing KCl with K(2)HPO(4), the chloride salt containing system has a lower potential, indicating that heme-HPX is easier to oxidize. These physical properties related to ferri-/ferro-heme reduction are both structurally and biologically relevant for heme release from HPX for transport and regulation of heme oxygenase expression. Consistent with this, when the acidification of endosomes is prevented by bafilomycin then heme oxygenase-1 induction by heme-HPX no longer occurs.","PMID":17712531,"authors":[{"lastName":"Flaherty","initials":"MM","foreName":"Meghan M"},{"lastName":"Rish","initials":"KR","foreName":"Kimberley R"},{"lastName":"Smith","initials":"A","foreName":"Ann"},{"lastName":"Crumbliss","initials":"AL","foreName":"Alvin L"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13761,"articleTitle":"Buffer-assisted proton-coupled electron transfer in a model rhenium-tyrosine complex.","dateCreated":"2007-09-05","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0002-7863","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The calculations indicate that the model in which the proton acceptor is the phosphate buffer species HPO(4)2- can successfully reproduce the experimentally observed pH dependence of the overall rate and H/D kinetic isotope effect, whereas the model in which the proton acceptor is water is not physically reasonable for this system. The phosphate buffer species HPO4(2-) is favored over water as the proton acceptor in part because the proton donor-acceptor distance is approximately 0.2 A smaller for the phosphate acceptor due to its negative charge. The physical quantities impacting the overall rate constant, including the reorganization energies, reaction free energies, activation free energies, and vibronic couplings for the various pairs of reactant/product vibronic states, are analyzed for both hydrogen and deuterium transfer. The dominant contribution to the rate arises from nonadiabatic transitions between the ground reactant vibronic state and the third product vibronic state for hydrogen transfer and the fourth product vibronic state for deuterium transfer. These contributions dominate over contributions from lower product states because of the larger vibronic coupling, which arises from the greater overlap between the reactant and product vibrational wave functions.

Our objective was the systematic investigation of the relationship between LPC and inflammatory and nutritional parameters in cancer patients. Therefore, plasma LPC concentrations were assessed in 59 cancer patients and related to nutritional and inflammatory parameters. To determine LPC in blood plasma we developed and validated a HPTLC method.Average plasma LPC concentration was 207 +/- 59 microM which corresponds to the lower limit of the reported range in healthy subjects. No correlation between LPC and age, performance status, body mass index (BMI) or fat mass could be seen. However, LPC correlated inversely with plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and whole blood hydrogen peroxides (HPO). Further, a negative correlation could be observed between LPC and whole body extra cellular fluid volume (ECF) as well as with relative change in body weight since cancer diagnosis.In conclusion, LPC concentrations were decreased in cancer patients. LPC plasma concentrations correlated with weight loss and inflammatory parameters and, therefore, might be a general indicator of severity of malignant disease.","PMID":17623088,"authors":[{"lastName":"Taylor","initials":"LA","foreName":"Lenka A"},{"lastName":"Arends","initials":"J","foreName":"Jann"},{"lastName":"Hodina","initials":"AK","foreName":"Arwen K"},{"lastName":"Unger","initials":"C","foreName":"Clemens"},{"lastName":"Massing","initials":"U","foreName":"Ulrich"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13717,"articleTitle":"Filling out the Hippo pathway.","dateCreated":"2007-07-23","dateRevised":"2008-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1471-0072","issnType":"Print","title":"Nature reviews.

In vertebrates, two unrelated families of Na+ -dependent P(i) transporters carry out this task. Remarkably, the two families transport different P(i) species: whereas type II Na+/P(i) cotransporters (SCL34) prefer divalent HPO(4)(2-), type III Na(+)/P(i) cotransporters (SLC20) transport monovalent H2PO(4)(-). The SCL34 family comprises both electrogenic and electroneutral members that are expressed in various epithelia and other polarized cells. Through regulated activity in apical membranes of the gut and kidney, they maintain body P(i) homeostasis, and in salivary and mammary glands, liver, and testes they play a role in modulating the P(i) content of luminal fluids. The two SLC20 family members PiT-1 and PiT-2 are electrogenic and ubiquitously expressed and may serve a housekeeping role for cell P(i) homeostasis; however, also more specific roles are emerging for these transporters in, for example, bone mineralization.

The canal network was segmented by simple thresholding at a bone mineral density of 0.82 g.cm(-3) and its structural properties were determined. In intact hindlimbs, the canal network showed a biphasic change with growth, as represented by increases followed by decreases in canal volume fraction (Ca.vol.f), the density of canals running longitudinally (Ca.num.d), and the density of canal connections (Ca.con.d): Ca.vol.f=2.2, 3.1, and 1.8%, Ca.num.d=77, 98, and 70 mm(-2), and Ca.con.d=18, 41, and 21 mm(-3) in W6, W9, and W14, respectively.

Furthermore, the canal branching structure became more treelike in SN hindlimbs. The effect of SN on the canal network appeared mainly in the periosteal sector of the anteriolateral cortex in W9 and spread throughout the cortex in W14.

It has been shown that this interaction is mediated by the Sav-RASSF-Hpo domain, which is an interaction domain characterized for the Drosophila proteins Sav (human WW45), Hpo (human MST1 and MST2) and Warts/LATS (large tumor suppressor). Previously, we have reported that RASSF1A hypermethylation occurs frequently in soft tissue sarcoma and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis for cancer patients. In our study, we performed methylation analysis of the CpG island promoter of MST1, MST2, WW45, LATS1 and LATS2 in soft tissue sarcomas by methylation-specific PCR. No or a very low methylation frequency was detected for WW45, LATS1 and LATS2 (<7%). In 19 out of 52 (37%) sarcomas, a methylated promoter of MST1 was detected and 12 out of 60 (20%) samples showed methylation of the MST2 promoter. Methylation status of MST1 was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. In tumors harboring a methylated promoter of MST1, a reduction of MST1 expression was observed by RT-PCR. In leiomyosarcomas, MST1 and MST2 or RASSF1A methylation were mutually exclusive (P = 0.007 and P = 0.025, respectively). Surprisingly, a significantly increased risk for tumor-related death was found for patients with an unmethylated MST1 promoter (P = 0.036).

This study characterizes P(i) transport in MV derived from articular cartilage.Matrix vesicles were harvested from collagenase digests of bovine articular cartilage by serial centrifugation. P(i) uptake by MV was measured using radioactive phosphate ((33)[P]HPO(4)(2-)). The Na(+) dependence, pH sensitivity and effects of P(i) analogues that inhibit P(i) transport were determined.P(i) uptake was temperature-sensitive and comprised Na(+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent components. The Na(+)-dependent component saturated at high extracellular P(i) concentrations, with a K(m) of 0.16 mM. In Na(+)-free solutions, uptake did not fully saturate implying that carrier-mediated uptake is supplemented by a diffusive pathway. Uptake was inhibited by phosphonoacetate and arsenate, although a fraction of Na(+)-independent P(i) uptake persisted. Total P(i) uptake was maximal at pH 6.5, and reduced at more acidic or alkaline values, representing inhibition of both components.These properties are highly similar to those of P(i) uptake by chondrocytes, suggesting that MV inherit P(i) transporters of the chondrocyte membrane from which they are derived. Na(+)-independent P(i) uptake has not previously been described in MV from growth plate cartilage and is relatively uncharacterized, but warrants further attention in articular cartilage, given its likely role in initiating inappropriate mineral formation.","PMID":17516935,"authors":[{"lastName":"Solomon","initials":"DH","foreName":"D H"},{"lastName":"Browning","initials":"JA","foreName":"J A"},{"lastName":"Wilkins","initials":"RJ","foreName":"R J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13710,"articleTitle":"Synthesis and phosphate uptake behavior of Zr4+ incorporated MgAl-layered double hydroxides.","dateCreated":"2007-07-16","dateRevised":"2009-11-11","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9797","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of colloid and interface science","isoAbbreviation":"J Colloid Interface Sci"},"articleDate":"2007-05-16","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"We synthesized Zr(4+) incorporated MgAl-layered double hydroxides, Mg(AlZr)-LDH(A) (where A denotes a counteranion in the interlayer space and is expressed as CO(3) for carbonate and Cl for chloride ions), with different molar ratios of Mg/(Al+Zr).

The large uptake and high selectivity of the CO(3)-type tertiary LDH materials is well explained by complex formation of phosphate ions directly with Zr(IV) centers in the layers.","PMID":17509605,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chitrakar","initials":"R","foreName":"Ramesh"},{"lastName":"Tezuka","initials":"S","foreName":"Satoko"},{"lastName":"Sonoda","initials":"A","foreName":"Akinari"},{"lastName":"Sakane","initials":"K","foreName":"Kohji"},{"lastName":"Ooi","initials":"K","foreName":"Kenta"},{"lastName":"Hirotsu","initials":"T","foreName":"Takahiro"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14230,"articleTitle":"Study of natural organic matter fractions in water sources of Tehran.","dateCreated":"2008-12-17","dateRevised":"2015-03-11","publication":{"issnNumber":"1028-8880","issnType":"Print","title":"Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS","isoAbbreviation":"Pak.

Although, NOMs are considered harmless but they have been recognized disinfection by-products precursors (DBP(s)) during the chlorination process. Formation of DBP(s) highly depends on the composition and concentration of NOM, which can be broadly divided into two fractions of hydrophobic (humic) and hydrophilic (non-humic) substances. The objective of this study was to determine Natural organic matter and its fractions concentration in the surface water sources of Tehran. Water sampling was conducted monthly between May to July 2006 in three rivers Lar, Jajrood and Karaj as the main drinking water supplying sources in Tehran. Quantitative parameters of pH, EC, UV254 and DOC were studied based on to standard methods. The XAD-7 resin method was used for fractionation of NOM. Results showed that NOM concentrations in Lar, Jajrood and Karaj rivers were 8.53, 12.9 and 11.3 mg L(-1), respectively. The HPO (hydrophobic) fraction was predominant compared to the HPI (hydrophilic) fraction in the all of water samples. The mean of total percent of HPO and HPI fractions were about 57 and 43%, respectively. Since the hydrophobic NOM fraction exhibits higher trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) than hydrophilic NOM, Tehran water chlorination exhibits higher THMFP than haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP). The information obtained from this study may be further employed in the design of the control technique and management strategies for the water treatment plant, especially for DBP(s) reduction.","PMID":19086524,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zazouli","initials":"MA","foreName":"M A"},{"lastName":"Nasseri","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Mahvi","initials":"AH","foreName":"A H"},{"lastName":"Mesdaghinia","initials":"AR","foreName":"A R"},{"lastName":"Gholami","initials":"M","foreName":"M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13787,"articleTitle":"Engineering bacteria for production of rhamnolipid as an agent for enhanced oil recovery.","dateCreated":"2007-10-01","dateRevised":"2007-10-01","publication":{"issnNumber":"0006-3592","issnType":"Print","title":"Biotechnology and bioengineering","isoAbbreviation":"Biotechnol.

Rhamnolipid is composed of rhamnose sugar molecule and beta-hydroxyalkanoic acid. The rhamnosyltransferase 1 complex (RhlAB) is the key enzyme responsible for transferring the rhamnose moiety to the beta-hydroxyalkanoic acid moiety to biosynthesize rhamnolipid. Through transposome-mediated chromosome integration, the RhlAB gene was inserted into the chromosome of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-rhlA(-) and Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), neither of which could produce rhamnolipid. After chromosome integration of the RhlAB gene, the constitute strains P. aeruginosa PEER02 and E. coli TnERAB did produce rhamnolipid. The HPLC/MS spectrum showed that the structure of purified rhamnolipid from P. aeruginosa PEER02 was similar to that from other P. aeruginosa strains, but with different percentage for each of the several congeners. The main congener (near 60%) of purified rhamnolipid from E. coli TnERAB was 3-(3-hydroxydecanoyloxy) decanoate (C(10)-C(10)) with mono-rhamnose. The surfactant performance of rhamnolipid was evaluated by measurement of interfacial tension (IFT) and oil recovery via sand-pack flooding tests. As expected, pH and salt concentration of the rhamnolipid solution significantly affected the IFT properties. With just 250 mg/L rhamnolipid (from P. aeruginosa PEER02 with soybean oil as substrate) in citrate-Na(2)HPO(4), pH 5, 2% NaCl, 42% of oil otherwise trapped was recovered from a sand pack. This result suggests rhamnolipid might be considered for EOR applications.","PMID":17486652,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qinhong"},{"lastName":"Fang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiangdong"},{"lastName":"Bai","initials":"B","foreName":"Baojun"},{"lastName":"Liang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaolin"},{"lastName":"Shuler","initials":"PJ","foreName":"Patrick J"},{"lastName":"Goddard","initials":"WA","foreName":"William A"},{"lastName":"Tang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yongchun"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13732,"articleTitle":"Reaction of sodium calcium borate glasses to form hydroxyapatite.","dateCreated":"2007-08-07","dateRevised":"2017-10-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0957-4530","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of materials science.

Glass samples in the form of irregular particles (125-180 microm) and microspheres (45-90 and 125-180 microm) were used in order to understand the reaction mechanism. The effect of glass composition (calcium content) on the weight loss rate and reaction temperature on crystal size, crystallinity and grain shape of the reaction products were studied. Carbonated HA was made by dissolving an appropriate amount of carbonate (K(2)CO(3)) in the 0.25 M phosphate solution. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the reaction products. The results show that sodium calcium borate glasses can be transformed to HA by reacting with a phosphate solution. It is essentially a process of dissolution of glass and precipitation of HA. The transformation begins from an amorphous state to calcium-deficient HA without changing the size and shape of the original glass sample. Glass with a lower calcium content (1CaO . 2Na(2)O . 6B(2)O(3)), or reacted at an elevated temperature (75 degrees C), has a higher reaction rate. The HA crystal size increases and grain shape changes from spheroidal to cylindrical as temperature increases from 37 to 200 degrees C. Increase in carbonate concentration can also decrease the crystal size and yield a more needle-like grain shape.","PMID":17486301,"authors":[{"lastName":"Han","initials":"X","foreName":"Xue"},{"lastName":"Day","initials":"DE","foreName":"Delbert E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13732,"articleTitle":"Biomimetic coating of an apatite layer on poly(L-lactic acid); improvement of adhesive strength of the coating.","dateCreated":"2007-08-07","dateRevised":"2017-10-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0957-4530","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of materials science.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Hippo (Hpo) signaling plays a crucial role in coordinating these processes by restricting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Here we provide evidence that the Mob as tumor suppressor protein, Mats, functions as a key component of the Hpo signaling pathway. We found that Mats associates with Hpo in a protein complex and is a target of the Hpo serine/threonine protein kinase. Mats phosphorylation by Hpo increases its affinity with Warts (Wts)/large tumor suppressor (Lats) serine/threonine protein kinase and ability to upregulate Wts catalytic activity to target downstream molecules such as Yorkie (Yki). Consistently, our epistatic analysis suggests that mats acts downstream of hpo. Coexpression analysis indicated that Mats can indeed potentiate Hpo-mediated growth inhibition in vivo. Our results support a model in which Mats is activated by Hpo through phosphorylation for growth inhibition, and this regulatory mechanism is conserved from flies to mammals.","PMID":17347649,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaomu"},{"lastName":"Shimizu","initials":"T","foreName":"Takeshi"},{"lastName":"Lai","initials":"ZC","foreName":"Zhi-Chun"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13598,"articleTitle":"Toward iron sensors: bioinspired tripods based on fluorescent phenol-oxazoline coordination sites.","dateCreated":"2007-03-26","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0020-1669","issnType":"Print","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2007-02-28","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In the quest for fast throughput metal biosensors, it would be of interest to prepare fluorophoric ligands with surface-adhesive moieties. Biomimetic analogues to microbial siderophores possessing such ligands offer attractive model compounds and new opportunities to meet this challenge. The design, synthesis, and physicochemical characterization of biomimetic analogues of microbial siderophores from Paracoccus denitrificans and from the Vibrio genus are described. The (4S,5S)-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazole-4-carbonyl group (La), noted here as an HPO unit, was selected for its potential dual properties, serving as a selective iron(III) binder and simultaneously as a fluorophore. Three tripodal symmetric analogues cis-Lb, cis-Lc, and trans-Lc, which mainly differ in the length of the spacers between the central carbon anchor and the ligating sites, were synthesized. These ferric-carriers were built from a tetrahedral carbon as an anchor, symmetrically extended by three converging iron-binding chains, each bearing a terminal HPO. The fourth chain could contain a surface-adhesive function (Lc). A combination of absorption and emission spectrophotometry, potentiometry, electrospray mass spectrometry, and electrochemistry was used to fully characterize the corresponding ferric complexes and to determine their stability. The quenching mechanism is consistent with an intramolecular static process and is more efficient for the analogue with longer arms. Detection limits in the low nanogram per milliliter range, comparable with the best chemosensors based on natural peptide siderophores, have been determined. These results clearly demonstrate that these tris(phenol-oxazoline) ligands in a tripodal arrangement firmly bind iron(III). Due to their fluorescent properties, the coordination event can be easily monitored, while the fourth arm is available for surface-adhesive moieties. The tripodal system is therefore an ideal candidate for integration with solid-state materials for the development of chip-based devices and analytical methodologies.","PMID":17326624,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kikkeri","initials":"R","foreName":"Raghavendra"},{"lastName":"Traboulsi","initials":"H","foreName":"Hassan"},{"lastName":"Humbert","initials":"N","foreName":"Nicolas"},{"lastName":"Gumienna-Kontecka","initials":"E","foreName":"Elzbieta"},{"lastName":"Arad-Yellin","initials":"R","foreName":"Rina"},{"lastName":"Melman","initials":"G","foreName":"Galina"},{"lastName":"Elhabiri","initials":"M","foreName":"Mourad"},{"lastName":"Albrecht-Gary","initials":"AM","foreName":"Anne-Marie"},{"lastName":"Shanzer","initials":"A","foreName":"Abraham"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13567,"articleTitle":"The Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway - an emerging tumour-suppressor network.","dateCreated":"2007-02-23","dateRevised":"2009-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"1474-175X","issnType":"Print","title":"Nature reviews.

The stabilizing effect of Mst was much greater on N-terminally truncated hSav mutants, as long as they retained the ability to bind Mst. Mst mutants that lacked the C-terminal coiled-coil domain and were unable to bind to hSav, also failed to stabilize or phosphorylate hSav, whereas catalytically inactive Mst mutants that retained the ability to bind to hSav were still able to increase its abundance, although they were no longer able to phosphorylate hSav.

The optimal medium constituents were as follows (gL(-1)): glucose 20, tryptone 2, KH(2)PO(4) 0.46, K(2)HPO(4) 1 and MgSO(4).7H(2)O 0.5. The fungus was cultivated under various agitation and aeration conditions in a 5L stirred-tank bioreactor. The maximum cell mass and EPS production were obtained at a relatively high agitation speed of 200 rpm and at an aeration rate of 2 vvm. The flow behavior of the fermentation broth was Newtonian and the maximum apparent viscosity (35 cP) was observed at a highly aerated condition (2 vvm). The EPS productivity in an airlift reactor was higher than that in the stirred-tank reactor. The morphological study revealed that the fungus grows in mainly three different yeast-like forms: ovoid, elongated, and double yeast forms. The high population of the elongated yeast has a very close relationship to high EPS production. The EPS were protein-bound polysaccharides consisted of mainly mannose, xylose, and fucose. The molecular weights of EPS were determined to be (1.3-1.5)x10(6).","PMID":16872706,"authors":[{"lastName":"Cho","initials":"EJ","foreName":"Eun Jae"},{"lastName":"Oh","initials":"JY","foreName":"Jung Young"},{"lastName":"Chang","initials":"HY","foreName":"Hyun You"},{"lastName":"Yun","initials":"JW","foreName":"Jong Won"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13353,"articleTitle":"Dmp53 activates the Hippo pathway to promote cell death in response to DNA damage.","dateCreated":"2006-07-24","dateRevised":"2009-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0960-9822","issnType":"Print","title":"Current biology : CB","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

This program ensures that animals reach, but do not exceed, their typical size . Understanding how cells sense the limits of tissue size and respond accordingly by exiting the cell cycle or undergoing apoptosis has important implications for both developmental and cancer biology. The Hippo (Hpo) pathway comprises the kinases Hpo and Warts/Lats (Wts), the adaptors Salvador (Sav) and Mob1 as a tumor suppressor (Mats), the cytoskeletal proteins Expanded and Merlin, and the transcriptional cofactor Yorkie (Yki) . This pathway has been shown to restrict cell division and promote apoptosis. The caspase repressor DIAP1 appears to be a primary target of the Hpo pathway in cell-death control. Firstly, Hpo promotes DIAP1 phosphorylation, likely decreasing its stability. Secondly, Wts phosphorylates and inactivates Yki, decreasing DIAP1 transcription. Although we understand some of the events downstream of the Hpo kinase, its mode of activation remains mysterious. Here, we show that Hpo can be activated by Ionizing Radiations (IR) in a Dmp53 (Drosophila melanogaster p53)-dependent manner and that Hpo is required (though not absolutely) for the cell death response elicited by IR or Dmp53 ectopic expression.","PMID":16860746,"authors":[{"lastName":"Colombani","initials":"J","foreName":"Julien"},{"lastName":"Polesello","initials":"C","foreName":"Cédric"},{"lastName":"Josué","initials":"F","foreName":"Filipe"},{"lastName":"Tapon","initials":"N","foreName":"Nicolas"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13578,"articleTitle":"Hydration of inorganic phosphates in crystal lattices and in aqueous solution.

The objective of the present work was to comprehensively characterize the conversion of a silicate bioactive glass (45S5), a borate glass, and two intermediate borosilicate glass compositions to HA in a dilute phosphate solution at 37 degrees Celsius. The borate glass and the borosilicate glasses were derived from the 45S5 glass by fully or partially replacing the SiO(2) with B(2)O(3). Higher B(2)O(3) content produced a more rapid conversion of the glass to HA and a lower pH value of the phosphate solution. Whereas the borate glass was fully converted to HA in less than 4 days, the silicate (45S5) and borosilicate compositions were only partially converted even after 70 days, and contained residual SiO(2) in a Na-depleted core. The concentration of Na(+) in the phosphate solution increased with reaction time whereas the PO(4) (3-) concentration decreased, both reaching final limiting values at a rate that increased with the B(2)O(3) content of the glass. However, the Ca(2+) concentration in the solution remained low, below the detection limit of atomic absorption, throughout the reaction.

The in vitro system is prepared by mixing urea, sodium phosphate monobasic dehydrate, and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate at 100 degrees C. The images obtained by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show that the bladelike OCP crystals will transform into hexagonal rod-shaped HAp crystals as the pH of the reaction mixture increases slowly from 4.35 to 6.69 in 12 h. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that a trace amount of monetite was also precipitated when the pH was around 5. Together with computer-assisted lattice matching, our DQ NMR data reveal that OCP crystals transform to HAp topotaxially, where the [000](HAp) and [20](HAp) axes are along the same directions as the [001](OCP) and [010](OCP) axes, respectively. On the basis of our in vitro results, the formation of the central dark line commonly found in biological hard tissues could be explained by the inherent lattice mismatch between OCP and HAp.

It is proposed that increasing reactivity of alpha-TCP cements does not result in a corresponding increase in rate of strength development until there is sufficient supersaturation to produce significant crystal nucleation.","PMID":16615072,"authors":[{"lastName":"Camiré","initials":"CL","foreName":"C L"},{"lastName":"Nevsten","initials":"P","foreName":"P"},{"lastName":"Lidgren","initials":"L","foreName":"L"},{"lastName":"McCarthy","initials":"I","foreName":"I"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13236,"articleTitle":"Separation and detection of peroxynitrite and its metabolites by capillary electrophoresis with UV detection.","dateCreated":"2006-03-29","dateRevised":"2009-01-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9673","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of chromatography.

This feature of (14)N MAS NMR, which is the first demonstration for manifolds of ssb in MAS NMR without the potential information from a central transition, becomes especially useful at the slow spinning frequencies (nu(r) = 1000-1500 Hz) applied to some of the ammonium salts studied here.

Treatment of LLC-PK(1) cells with colchicine, cytochalasin D, concanavalin A and PMA increased the sodium-dependent phosphate co-transport and the cytotoxicity of uranium. On the contrary, replacement of the extra-cellular sodium with N-methyl-D-glucamine highly reduced the transport of phosphate and the cytotoxic effect of uranium. Uranium cytotoxicity was also dependent upon the extra-cellular concentration of phosphate and decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by 0.1-10 mM phosphonoformic acid, a competitive inhibitor of phosphate uptake. Consistent with these observations, over-expression of the rat proximal tubule sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter NaPi-IIa in stably transfected MDCK cells significantly increased the cytotoxicity of uranium, and computer modeling of uranium speciation showed that uranium cytotoxicity was directly dependent on the presence of the phosphate complexes of uranyl UO(2)(PO(4))(-) and UO(2)(HPO(4))(aq).

This study aimed to investigate the potential of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) crystals for the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells and the potential of these cell seeded crystals as 'building blocks' for manufacture of self-supporting macroscale tissue constructs. An inverse relationship between cell number and crystal surface area was found and marrow cells grown on OCP crystals expressed osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNA, markers of osteoblastic differentiation, even in the absence of inductive media additives. Self-supporting crystal tissue macroscale constructs could be fabricated by culturing cell loaded crystals in moulds of the desired shape.

Observation of the cross section of the composite by energy-dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) revealed that the composite consisted of two phases, i.e., a hard HAP-rich phase and a soft polymer-rich phase. In the HAP-rich phase, the space inside the hydrogel was occupied by HAP, while HAP was not mineralized in the polymer-rich phase. The nucleation seemed to take place, at first, at the middle depth of the hydrogel where the HAP-rich phase was formed. The HAP-rich phase grew its size toward the surface of the hydrogel at the cost of the polymer-rich phase. The presence of phosphorus, P, in the polymer-rich phase indicated the adsorption of HPO(4)(2-) on the polymer chain of the hydrogel via hydrogen bonding, accompanied with Ca(2+) because of electrostatic constraints. This adsorption of ions in addition to Donnan distribution of ions leads to the formation of a hypercomplex that can be regarded as a precursor of the HAP-rich phase. The change of the hypercomplex into the HAP-rich phase is discontinuous and hence concluded as a phase transition.

The channel opening is usually attributed to the outward (i.e., toward the extracellular side of the membrane) motion of S4. The evidence for this motion is based on certain experiments that appear to show differential access to parts of S4 from the intracellular and extracellular sides of the membrane in the open and closed states. A newly available structure [S.B. Long, E.B. Campbell and R. MacKinnon, Crystal structure of a mammalian voltage-dependent Shaker family K(+) channel. Science 309 (2005) 897-903; S.B. Long, E.B. Campbell, R. MacKinnon, Voltage sensor of Kv1.2: structural basis of electromechanical coupling. Science 309 (2005) 903-908][1,2] has now been used to argue for a large scale motion, although, as a static structure, it is not conclusive. In this paper, we consider the effect of anions in the surrounding medium. Phosphate is present in the intracellular as well as the extracellular fluid, apparently at hundreds of micromolar concentration, or more. There is evidence in the literature suggesting that phosphate-arginine complexes are rather strong. In a recent calculation one of us [M.E. Green, A possible role for phosphate in complexing the arginines of S4 in voltage gated channels J. Theor. Biol. 233 (2005) 337-341][3] has shown that a model peptide with a 2:1 arg:phosphate complex should have a favorable geometry. Here, we present NMR evidence of the existence of phosphate complexes of a model peptide with two arginines separated by two hydrophobic residues, the same spacing as in S4 segments. The complexes (there are different complexes for HPO(4)(2-) and for H(2)PO(4)(-) [3]) form with concentrations of peptide in the range of hundreds of micromolar, making it significant in the biological context. NMR spectra provide changes in chemical shift as functions of both phosphate concentration and pH. The resulting curves show titration of the phosphate, with its standard pK. Possible implications for other anion-S4 interactions, including ion pairs rather than complexes, as with Cl(-), are also discussed.","PMID":16289371,"authors":[{"lastName":"Pradhan","initials":"P","foreName":"Padmanava"},{"lastName":"Ghose","initials":"R","foreName":"Ranajeet"},{"lastName":"Green","initials":"ME","foreName":"Michael E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13165,"articleTitle":"Characterization of industrial alkylpolyphosphonates by infusion electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry with identification of the impurities by tandem capillary zone electrophoresis.","dateCreated":"2006-01-17","dateRevised":"2006-01-17","publication":{"issnNumber":"1076-5174","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS","isoAbbreviation":"J Mass Spectrom"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Technical grade diethylene-triaminepentakis(methylenephosphonic acid) (I), dihexamethylene-triaminepentakis(methylenephosphonic acid) (II), ethylene-diaminetetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid) (III), hexamethylene-diaminetetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid) (IV), amino-tris(methylenephosphonic acid) (V), hydroxyethyl-aminobis(methylenephosphonic acid) (VI), 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (VII), and 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (VIII) were characterized by ion trap mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (ESI-ITMS).

In this study, we report the crystal structures of Pta from Bacillus subtilis at 2.75 A resolution and its complex with acetyl phosphate, one of its substrates, at 2.85 A resolution. In addition, the Pta activity of the enzyme has been assayed. The enzyme folds into an alpha/beta architecture with two domains separated by a prominent cleft, very similar to two other known Pta structures. The enzyme-acetyl phosphate complex structure reveals a few potential substrate binding sites. Two of them are located in the middle of the interdomain cleft: each one is surrounded by a region of strictly and highly conserved residues. High structural similarities are found with 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxA), and isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases, all of which utilize NADP+ as their cofactor, which binds in the interdomain cleft. Their substrate binding sites are close to the acetyl phosphate binding sites of Pta in the cleft as well.

O(2) exchange was measured with a 5-chamber data-logging apparatus and ETR with a submersible pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer (Diving-PAM). Steady-state quantum yield ((F(m)'-F(t))/F(m)') decreased from 0.7 during the morning to 0.45 at midday, followed by some recovery in the late afternoon. At low to medium irradiances (0-300 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)), there was a significant correlation between O(2) evolution and ETR, but at higher irradiances, ETR continued to increase steadily, while O(2) evolution tended towards an asymptote. However at high irradiance levels (600-1200 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) ETR was significantly lowered. Two methods of measuring ETR, based on either diel ambient light levels and fluorescence yields or rapid light curves, gave similar results at low to moderate irradiance levels. Nutrient enrichment (increases in [NO(3) (-)], [NH(4) (+)] and [HPO(4) (2-)] of 5- to 15-fold over ambient concentrations) resulted in an increase, within hours, in photosynthetic rates measured by both ETR and O(2) evolution techniques. At low irradiances, approximately 6.5 to 8.2 electrons passed through PS II during the evolution of one molecule of O(2), i.e., up to twice the theoretical minimum number of four.

In this method, on-target dephosphorylation experiments are conducted on IMAC-bound phosphopeptides, because dephosphorylated peptides have, in general, higher MS sensitivities than the corresponding phosphopeptides. The detected dephosphorylated peptides are sequenced by MS/MS, which identifies the potentially phosphorylated peptide and the total number of Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues that could hypothetically be phosphorylated within that peptide. On the basis of this information, a mass list containing every possible phosphorylation state of each observed peptide (where 1 HPO(3) = 80 Da) is used to direct MALDI-MS/MS on the phosphorylated peptides bound to IMAC beads at each theoretical mass from the list. If the peptide is present, the resulting MS/MS spectrum reveals the exact site(s) of phosphorylation in the peptide. We have demonstrated the applicability of PPD to the detection of in vivo phosphorylation sites on the Drosophila Stem Loop Binding Protein (dSLBP), and the complementarity of this new technique to conventional MS phosphorylation site mapping methods, since the phosphorylation sites in dSLBP could not be detected by other methods.","PMID":16212415,"authors":[{"lastName":"Torres","initials":"MP","foreName":"Matthew P"},{"lastName":"Thapar","initials":"R","foreName":"Roopa"},{"lastName":"Marzluff","initials":"WF","foreName":"William F"},{"lastName":"Borchers","initials":"CH","foreName":"Christoph H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13062,"articleTitle":"Neuroendocrine aspects of amenorrhea related to stress.","dateCreated":"2005-10-06","dateRevised":"2008-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1565-4753","issnType":"Print","title":"Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER","isoAbbreviation":"Pediatr Endocrinol Rev"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Reproductive functions are controlled by a very sophisticated system that is composed by the perfect syncronization of neuronal end endocrinological functions. Hypothalamus is the neuroendocrine gland that discharges GnRH that stimulates LH and FSH secretion from pituitary thus promoting ovarian function. Whatever affects the hypothalamic activity might be able to interfere with the reproductive axis. In fact changes in such sophisticated stimulatory system is able to negatively affect the periodical function of the ovary and may induce amenorrhea. Stressant situations, due to physical, psychologic or metabolic stressors, are able to negatively modulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO) mainly acting through an impairment of the many neuromodulators and neuropeptides that are produced inside the brain and in the hypothalamic areas. Stress induced amenorrhea is usually called hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) and affect a consistent percentage of women, independently from the age. Nevertheless, quite often HA is diagnosed in adolescents or in girls below 20 years of age. Undernutrition, excess of training, psychological stress, are able to induce HA and then hypo-estrogenism due to the reduced ovarian activity. When sports or exaggerated training is performed before or during the onset of menarche, a specific delay of menarche might occur, as direct consequence of the unbalance between feeding, energy consumption and psychological stress. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are possible consequence of such situation. Clinicians have to pay great attention to all kind of delay of occurrence of meanarche or of amenorrhea, especially if related to lost of weight, since these might mask adverse environmental situations that might induce HA through an exaggerated stress-induced neuroendocrine response.","PMID":16208279,"authors":[{"lastName":"Genazzani","initials":"AD","foreName":"Alessandro D"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13133,"articleTitle":"Tooth whitening products and the risk of oral cancer.","dateCreated":"2005-12-16","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0278-6915","issnType":"Print","title":"Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association","isoAbbreviation":"Food Chem.

This minireview attempts to present a concise review on aging of the female reproductive neuroendocrine axis and provide thought-provoking analysis and insights into potential future directions for this field. Evidence will be reviewed, which shows that a defect in pulsatile and surge gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion exists in normal cycling middle-aged female rats, which is thought to explain the significantly attenuated pulsatile and surge luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion at middle-age. Evidence is also presented, which supports the age-related defect in GnRH secretion as being due to a reduced activation of GnRH neurons. Along these lines, stimulation of GnRH secretion by the major excitatory transmitter glutamate is shown to be significantly attenuated in middle-aged proestrous rats. Corresponding age-related defects in other major excitatory regulatory factors, such as catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, and astrocytes, have also been demonstrated.

The variation in HA surface charge with pH for two different KCl electrolyte concentrations was determined titrimetrically and the point of zero charge (PZC) found to be at a pH of 7.3 +/- 0.1. The curves also demonstrated that HA accumulates positive charge more readily below the PZC than it accumulates negative charge above it. Extended titration data indicated that dissolution occurred more rapidly in increasingly acidic conditions, but was inhibited by increasing electrolyte strength. Similar experiments with 2.5 mM Ca(2+) in the electrolyte show that Ca(2+) adsorption balances loss of H(+) to give a near-neutral surface at any pH above 7 (subject to availability of calcium ions and adsorption sites). The mechanism for adsorption has been shown to be deprotonation of adjacent surface HPO(4)(2-) sites and subsequent adsorption of a calcium ion to the lattice surface site. Furthermore, inhibition of dissolution under alkaline conditions in the presence of Ca(2+) suggested that dissolution was driven by desorption of Ca(2+).

The phosphate uptake increased slightly with an increase in the adsorption temperature. The adsorption isotherm followed Freundlich's equation with constants of logK(F)=1.25 and 1/n=0.65, indicating that it could effectively remove phosphate even from a solution of markedly low phosphate concentration as well as with large numbers of coexisting ions. The pH dependence showed a maximum phosphate uptake around pH 8.5. The pH dependence curve suggested that selective phosphate adsorption progresses mainly by the ion exchange of HPO(2-)4.

Those involved in sports that emphasize lean body type are at high risk for the development of menstrual dysfunction, including amenorrhea. This is mediated by an alteration in function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, with loss of normal secretion of luteinizing hormone, and subsequent lack of estrogen production. Disruption of the HPO axis appears to be dependent on the body's recognition of an energy imbalance, which may be due to a lack of compensatory caloric intake in the face of significant energy expenditure. Other pituitary hormones, such as triiodothyronine, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 may also be affected. These metabolic changes have an impact on bone mineralization during a critical period in the development of bone mass. Recognition by physicians of the so-called 'female athlete triad', consisting of disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis, may allow therapeutic intervention. Diagnosis of eating disorders and decreased bone mineral density can have significant impact on the health of the young athlete. Treatment is aimed at restoring normal menstrual function by increasing caloric intake to balance the increased energy demands of athletic participation. Concurrent treatment of the hypoestrogenemic state using estrogen replacement is controversial, but may aid in alleviating further loss of bone mass.","PMID":15898820,"authors":[{"lastName":"Stafford","initials":"DE","foreName":"Diane E J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12919,"articleTitle":"Direct association of hepatopoietin with thioredoxin constitutes a redox signal transduction in activation of AP-1/NF-kappaB.","dateCreated":"2005-05-16","dateRevised":"2014-11-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"0898-6568","issnType":"Print","title":"Cellular signalling","isoAbbreviation":"Cell.

When HPO and TRX were cotransfected into COS7 cells, the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-kappaB was evidently enhanced compared with the transfection with HPO or TRX alone, at the same time, the phosphorylation of c-Jun was increased. They were colocalized in the cells. By Co-IP and GST pull-down experiments, we found that HPO could physically interact with TRX, which was also confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assay. By further investigation, we found both HPO and TRX were sensitive to cellular oxidative state. HPO dimer is in its natural state and could be reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT) in vitro and in vivo. Under the treatment of oxidants such as H(2)O(2) and diamide, the amount of HPO monomer was decreased significantly and assembled into dimer, and the free thiol in TRX was oxidized. HPO could transfer oxidizing equivalents to TRX via direct thiol-disulfide exchange in vitro, the redox state of TRX was also affected by HPO in vivo. Taken together, it was implicated that the oxidizing equivalents might flow from HPO to TRX and then to substrate protein by the dimerization of HPO, and its interaction with TRX finally activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor, suggesting a new redox signal pathway conducted by thiol-disulfide transformation in eukaryocytic cytoplasm.","PMID":15894171,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yingxian"},{"lastName":"Liu","initials":"W","foreName":"Wanying"},{"lastName":"Xing","initials":"G","foreName":"Guichun"},{"lastName":"Tian","initials":"C","foreName":"Chunyan"},{"lastName":"Zhu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yunping"},{"lastName":"He","initials":"F","foreName":"Fuchu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12912,"articleTitle":"New hydrothermal synthesis and structure of Th2(PO4)2(HPO4).H2O: the first structurally characterized thorium Hydrogenphosphate.","dateCreated":"2005-05-09","dateRevised":"2005-05-09","publication":{"issnNumber":"0020-1669","issnType":"Print","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Th(2)(PO(4))(2)(HPO(4)).H(2)O was synthesized under wet hydrothermal conditions starting from a mixture of H(3)PO(3) and Th(NO(3))(4).5H(2)O.

Individuals with functional hypothalamic hypogonadism typically engage in a combination of behaviors that serve as psychogenic stressors and present metabolic challenges. Complete recovery of gonadal function depends upon restoration of the HPA and HPT axes. Hormone replacement strategies have limited benefit because they do not promote recovery from these allostatic endocrine adjustments in the HPA and HPT axes. Indeed, the rationale for the use of sex steroid replacement is based on the erroneous assumption that functional forms of hypothalamic hypogonadism represent only an alteration in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Further, use of sex hormones masks deficits that accrue from altered HPA and HPT function. Long-term deleterious consequences of stress-induced anovulation may include an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, depression, other psychiatric conditions, and dementia. Although fertility can be restored with exogenous administration of gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH, fertility management alone will not permit recovery of the HPA and HPT axes.

However, accumulating evidence including the phenotype of Raf-1(-/-) mice suggested that Raf-1 may have other functions independent of its role as MEK activator, in particular pertaining to protection against apoptosis. We have recently demonstrated a new role of Raf-1 by showing that Raf-1 controls the proapoptotic kinase MST2/Hippo. In mammalian cells MST2 is activated by stress signals and causes apoptosis when overexpressed. Its Drosophila homologue Hippo regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest during differentiation. Raf-1 inhibits MST2 by preventing its dimerisation and recruiting a phosphatase that removes activating phosphorylations on MST2. Both functions require Raf-1 binding to MST2, but are independent of Raf-1's kinase activity and the ERK pathway. Downregulation of MST2 by siRNA reverts the apoptosis hypersensitivity of Raf-1(-/-) mouse fibroblasts. In contrast, the downregulation of Raf-1 in Raf-1(+/+) cells and human cancer cell lines enhances susceptibility to Fas induced apoptosis, which is rescued by concomitant downregulation of both Raf-1 and MST2. The MST2:Raf-1 complex is dissociated by stress signals as well as mitogens. Stress signals robustly activate MST2 and trigger apoptosis. Mitogens only make MST2 permissive for activation by releasing it from Raf-1, and in addition activate survival pathways allowing proliferation. Thus, by linking mitogenic and apoptotic signalling the MST:Raf-1 complex may serve as a safeguard against unlicensed proliferation.","PMID":15701972,"authors":[{"lastName":"O'Neill","initials":"E","foreName":"Eric"},{"lastName":"Kolch","initials":"W","foreName":"Walter"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12821,"articleTitle":"Adsorption of gaseous formaldehyde and carboxylic acids by ammonium-ion-exchanged alpha-zirconium phosphate.","dateCreated":"2005-02-07","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9797","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of colloid and interface science","isoAbbreviation":"J Colloid Interface Sci"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Ammonium-ion-exchanged alpha-Zr(HPO(4))(2)H(2)O (alpha-ZrP) was obtained as a single phase with the interlayer distance of 9.4 A by the ion-exchange of proton with ammonium ion.

Little, however, is known about the function and regulation of human Lats kinases. Here we report that human Mst2, a STE20-family member and purported Hpo ortholog, phosphorylates and activates both Lats1 and Lats2. Deletion analysis revealed that regulation of Lats1 occurs through the C-terminal, catalytic domain. Within this domain, two regulatory phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry. These sites, S909 in the activation loop and T1079 within a hydrophobic motif, have been highly conserved during evolution. Moreover, a direct interaction was observed between Mst2 and hWW45, a putative ortholog of Drosophila Sav. These results indicate that Mst2-like kinases regulate Lats kinase activities in an evolutionarily conserved regulatory pathway. Although the function of this pathway remains poorly understood in mammals, it is intriguing that, in Drosophila, it has been linked to development and tissue homeostasis.","PMID":15688006,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chan","initials":"EH","foreName":"Eunice H Y"},{"lastName":"Nousiainen","initials":"M","foreName":"Marjaana"},{"lastName":"Chalamalasetty","initials":"RB","foreName":"Ravindra B"},{"lastName":"Schäfer","initials":"A","foreName":"Anja"},{"lastName":"Nigg","initials":"EA","foreName":"Erich A"},{"lastName":"Silljé","initials":"HH","foreName":"Herman H W"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12814,"articleTitle":"Periodic ab initio calculation of nuclear quadrupole parameters as an assignment tool in solid-state NMR spectroscopy: applications to 23Na NMR spectra of crystalline materials.","dateCreated":"2005-01-31","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0926-2040","issnType":"Print","title":"Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance","isoAbbreviation":"Solid State Nucl Magn Reson"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Periodic ab initio HF calculations using the CRYSTAL code have been used to calculate (23)Na NMR quadrupole parameters for a wide range of crystalline sodium compounds including Na(3)OCl.

In the algorithms derived for buffer solutions, blood, and whole body (1-, 2-, and 3-fluid compartment), only bicarbonate is considered. On dilution at constant Pco(2), the final concentration of bicarbonate is the sum in terms of pH, due to the following processes: dilution, formation from chemical reaction with the nonbicarbonate buffers phosphate, hemoglobin, and plasma proteins, and transfer from erythrocytes and interstitial fluid to plasma. At constant Pco(2), the level of carbonic acid is held constant, whereas those of the buffer bases are reduced by dilution, resulting in acidosis. In mixed bicarbonate/phosphate buffer, the final concentration of HCO(3)(-) exceeds the diluted value due to additional buffering of H(2)CO(3) by HPO(4)(2-). For whole blood in vitro, pH, and actual bicarbonate concentration are predicted from dilution with 0.9% saline from initial Hb (100%) to infinite dilution (pure saline). The acidosis from dilution of plasma bicarbonate is mitigated by contributions from plasma proteins (<1 mmol/l) and from the erythrocytes ( approximately 5 mmol/l). Similarly, for whole body, the main contributions to combat primary dilutional acidosis in the range of hemodilution (relative Hb: 100-50%) are from the erythrocytes (1.2-2.2 mmol/l) and from the interstitial fluid (3.3-7.2 mmol/l).

Several studies have documented MIF expression in the sera following hepatic resection or in the course of liver cancer progression, but there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of MIF on hepatoma cells and relating mechanisms. In this paper, by [3H] thymidine incorporation, we found that exogenously added MIF could promote the proliferation of HepG2 in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatopoietin (HPO), as a liver-specific regeneration augmenter, could be induced by the expression of MIF in hepatoma cells. The activity of HPO promoter was increased, and its levels were enhanced after MIF was overexpressed in hepatoma cells. The similarities between HPO and MIF in structure and action led us to investigate their interaction and the inducing biological significance. Using yeast two-hybrid identification, we found that HPO interacted with MIF in yeast cells, and their binding ability was higher than that between HPO and JAB1 (Jun activation domain binding protein) or MIF and JAB1 in yeast cells. Their interaction was further verified by His pull-down assay in vitro and coimmunoprecipitation experiment in vivo. They were colocalized in the cytoplasm. Both HPO and MIF could bind to JAB1 and modulate the AP-1 pathway. When HPO and MIF were cotransfected into HepG2 cells, the binding activity of MIF to JAB1 was reduced, and the activity of AP-1 was improved. In contrast, MIF overexpressed in HepG2 was unable to interfere with the binding activity of HPO to JAB1, but its potentiation on AP-1 activity was reduced significantly. Taken together, these results indicate that MIF plays an important role in the proliferation of hepatoma cells, and the effect of MIF is in concert with HPO.","PMID":15475002,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yingxian"},{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"C","foreName":"Chengrong"},{"lastName":"Xing","initials":"G","foreName":"Guichun"},{"lastName":"Zhu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yunping"},{"lastName":"He","initials":"F","foreName":"Fuchu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12692,"articleTitle":"Evaluation of chromatin integrity in human sperm using acridine orange staining with different fixatives and after cryopreservation.","dateCreated":"2004-10-01","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0303-4569","issnType":"Print","title":"Andrologia","isoAbbreviation":"Andrologia"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Staining of cells with acridine orange (AO) has been widely accepted as a predictor of DNA damage in many cell types.

Present data also showed that spermatozoa from some individuals are more prone to DNA damage after freezing and thawing procedures than others. In conclusion, Carnoy's fixative provides a better predictive value for DNA damage to sperm using AO staining. Additionally, cryopreservation increased damage to the sperm DNA.","PMID":15458552,"authors":[{"lastName":"Chohan","initials":"KR","foreName":"K R"},{"lastName":"Griffin","initials":"JT","foreName":"J T"},{"lastName":"Carrell","initials":"DT","foreName":"D T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12688,"articleTitle":"Cobalt(III) complexes of monodentate N9-bound adeninate (ade-), [Co(ade-kappaN9)Cl(en)2]+ (en = 1,2-diaminoethane): syntheses, crystal structures, and protonation behaviors of the geometrical isomers.","dateCreated":"2004-09-27","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0020-1669","issnType":"Print","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In acidic aqueous solution, a cobalt(III) complex containing monodentate N(9)-bound adeninate (ade(-)), cis-[Co(ade-kappaN(9))Cl(en)(2)]Cl (cis-[1]Cl), underwent protonation to the adeninate moiety without geometrical isomerization or decomposition of the Co(III) coordination sphere, and complexes of cis-[CoCl(Hade)(en)(2)]Cl(2) (cis-[2]Cl(2)) and cis-[Co(H(2)ade)Cl(en)(2)]Cl(3) (cis-[3]Cl(3)) could be isolated.

Supplemented reconstituted skim milk samples were acidified to pH 5.80 by the addition of CO(2) under pressure and depressurized under vacuum to restore the initial pH value. The second-order polynomial models satisfactorily predicted the effect of salt addition on the micellar molar Ca:P ratio and the average diameter of the casein micelles, whereas only trends were used in the analysis of the rennet-clotting behavior of salt-supplemented, CO(2)-treated milk. Whether added Ca was the most determinant factor on the micellar molar Ca:P ratio, added Pi (a mixture of Na(2)HPO(4) and NaH(2)PO(4)) was the most determinant factor on the other responses studied, and its effect was most pronounced when Ca was simultaneously added.

In the case of Ca-supplemented milk, the micellar molar Ca:P ratio increased, the average micellar diameter decreased, and the rennet-clotting properties were improved, whereas opposite effects were observed upon Pi supplementation. Since modification of the micellar molar ratio is the result of change in the chemical composition of micellar calcium phosphate, the effect of calcium and phosphate supplementation on the rennet clotting of milk was found to be also dependent on the nature of the interaction between caseins and colloidal calcium phosphate.","PMID":15377599,"authors":[{"lastName":"Guillaume","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Gastaldi","initials":"E","foreName":"E"},{"lastName":"Cuq","initials":"JL","foreName":"J-L"},{"lastName":"Marchesseau","initials":"S","foreName":"S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12677,"articleTitle":"Slik Sterile-20 kinase regulates Moesin activity to promote epithelial integrity during tissue growth.","dateCreated":"2004-09-16","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0890-9369","issnType":"Print","title":"Genes & development","isoAbbreviation":"Genes Dev."},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Drosophila Sterile-20 kinase Slik promotes tissue growth during development by stimulating cell proliferation and by preventing apoptosis.

Although several methods are proposed to treat the defect, however, the prognosis is generally poor. If the fusion of a tooth fracture by laser is possible it will offer an alternative to extraction or at least serve as an adjunctive treatment in the reconstruction. The responses of soft tissues to lasers of different wavelengths are fairly well known, but the reactions of hard tissues are still to be understood. The purpose of this research was to study the feasibility of using a medium energy continuous-wave CO(2) laser and a low melting-point bioactive glass to fuse or bridge tooth fractures. The present report is focused on the first part of the research, the analysis of changes in laser-irradiated human tooth enamel/dentin by means of X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier-transforming infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After CO(2) laser irradiation, there were no marked changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the enamel when compared to that before laser treatment. However, a small peak belonging to alpha-TCP appeared at the position of 2theta=30.78 degrees C. After being treated with CO(2) laser, the dentin showed much sharper peaks on the diffraction patterns because of grain growth and better crystallinity. alpha-TCP and beta-TCP were identified after laser treatment. In the FTIR analysis, an HPO(4)(-2) absorption band was noted before laser treatment disappeared after the irradiation. No significant change in the absorption band of HPO(4)(-2) was found on the FTIR curves of enamel after laser treatment. The results of DTA/TGA indicated that loss of water and organic materials occurred in both enamel and dentin after laser treatment. Under SEM, melting and resolidification occurred in both enamel and dentin by medium energy of CO(2) laser. This implies that using a continuous-wave CO(2) laser of medium energy density to fuse a low melting-point bioactive glass to the enamel/dentin is possible. We believe these phase changes and thermal data can make a useful guide for future studies on the thermal interaction and bridging mechanism between the bioactive glass and enamel/dentin under CO(2) laser irradiation.","PMID":15348019,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"CP","foreName":"C P"},{"lastName":"Lee","initials":"BS","foreName":"B S"},{"lastName":"Kok","initials":"SH","foreName":"S H"},{"lastName":"Lan","initials":"WH","foreName":"W H"},{"lastName":"Tseng","initials":"YC","foreName":"Y C"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"FH","foreName":"F H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12667,"articleTitle":"alpha-Tricalcium phosphate hydrolysis to hydroxyapatite at and near physiological temperature.","dateCreated":"2004-09-06","dateRevised":"2017-10-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0957-4530","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of materials science.

Regardless of the precursor characteristics and temperature, HAp formation is characterized by an initial period of wetting of the alpha-TCP precursor, an induction period and a growth period during which the bulk transformation to HAp occurs. The microstructures of the resultant HAp at all temperatures were generally similar and are characterized by the formation porous flake-like morphology. Microstructural coarsening was observed for the CDHAp formed above the physiological temperature. The hardening generated by the hydrolysis reaction was demonstrated using diametrical compression tests. The original tensile strength of 56% dense alpha-TCP increased from 0.70+/-0.1 MPa to 9.36+/-0.4 MPa after hydrolysis to CDHAp at 37 degrees C, corresponding to a density of 70%.","PMID":15348018,"authors":[{"lastName":"Durucan","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Brown","initials":"PW","foreName":"P W"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12664,"articleTitle":"Assessing the removal potential of soil-aquifer treatment systems for bulk organic matter.","dateCreated":"2004-09-03","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0273-1223","issnType":"Print","title":"Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research","isoAbbreviation":"Water Sci.

Our previous study indicated that HPO executes its function by an inter-reactive network of the autocrine, paracrine and endocrine pathways. Recently, we have demonstrated that intracellular HPO interacts with Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) and leads to potentiation of activating protein-1 (AP-1) activity in a MAPK independent fashion. JAB1 is the fifth subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), which is first identified as a suppressor of plant morphogenesis. A protein complex kinase activity associated with the CSN has been reported but not identified yet. In this report, we investigated further the association of HPO with the whole CSN. HPO exists in a complex with the eight-component CSN, both when purified from glycerol gradient centrifugation and when reciprocal immunoprecipitated from the lysates of transfected COS-7 cells. Intracellular HPO colocalizes with endogenous CSN in nucleus of hepatic cells. In addition, intracellular function of HPO that increases the phosphorylation of c-Jun leading to potentiate the AP-1 activity is inhibited by curcumin, a potent inhibitor of CSN-associated kinase. Taken together, these results elucidate a novel relationship of intracellular growth factor, HPO with large protein complex, CSN, which suggests a possible linkage between CSN and liver regeneration.","PMID":15304329,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yan"},{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"C","foreName":"Chengrong"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"H","foreName":"Handong"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"N","foreName":"Na"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaoxiao"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"L","foreName":"Lingqiang"},{"lastName":"Zhai","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yun"},{"lastName":"Zhu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yunping"},{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yinglin"},{"lastName":"He","initials":"F","foreName":"Fuchu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12634,"articleTitle":"Digestible energy values of diets with different fat supplements when fed to lactating dairy cows.","dateCreated":"2004-08-04","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0022-0302","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of dairy science","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Substitution of tryptophan (W) at the same locations gives WWW15. Both peptides have alpha-helical structure in phosphate buffer, as determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. D(2)O was used as solvent in the NR experiments to highlight structural heterogeneity across the hydrogenated peptide layers. At pH 7, YYY15 was found to form a weakly adsorbed interfacial monolayer. However, the mutant WWW15 showed strong interfacial adsorption, with the interfacial layer characterized by a middle hydrophobic sublayer of 7-8 A with lower scattering length density and two almost symmetrical hydrophilic outer sublayers of 6-8 A with higher scattering length density, suggesting the formation of a \"sideways-on\" helical conformation. An increase in pH to 9 resulted in the improved packing within the interfacial layer with similar structure. However, decrease in pH to 5 reduced the interfacial adsorption, mainly due to the enhanced solubility of the peptides associated with the protonation of arginine (R) and lysine (K) groups and the decreasing concentration of divalent HPO(4)(2-) in the phosphate buffer. Subsequent assessment of the reversibility of adsorption showed that once the peptide layers were formed they did not desorb.

We have investigated the protective effect of phosphate on solute retention and storage stability of egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC) liposomes that were dried (air-dried and freeze-dried) in the presence of sugars and phosphate. The protective effect of phosphate was tested using both glucose (low T(g)) and sucrose (high T(g)) by measuring leakage of carboxyfluorescein (CF), which was incorporated inside the vesicles. Liposomes that were dried with glucose or phosphate alone showed complete leakage after rehydration. However, approximately 30% CF-retention was obtained using mixtures of phosphate and glucose. Approximately 75% CF-retention was observed with liposomes that were dried with sucrose. The solute retention further increased to 85% using mixtures of phosphate and sucrose. The pH of the phosphate buffer prior to drying was found to have a strong effect on the solute retention. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies showed that phosphate and sugars form a strong hydrogen bonding network, which dramatically increased the T(g). The HPO(4)(2-) form of phosphate was found to interact stronger with sugars than the H(2)PO(4)(-) form. The increased solute retention of liposomes dried in the sugar phosphate mixtures did not coincide with improved storage stability. At temperatures below 60 degrees C the rate of solute-leakage was found to be strikingly higher in the presence of phosphate, indicating that phosphate impairs storage stability of dried liposomes.","PMID":15003875,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wolkers","initials":"WF","foreName":"Willem F"},{"lastName":"Oldenhof","initials":"H","foreName":"Harriëtte"},{"lastName":"Tablin","initials":"F","foreName":"Fern"},{"lastName":"Crowe","initials":"JH","foreName":"John H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12481,"articleTitle":"On-site simultaneous determination of anions and cations in drainage water using a flow injection-capillary electrophoresis system with contactless conductivity detection.","dateCreated":"2004-03-04","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1464-0325","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of environmental monitoring : JEM","isoAbbreviation":"J Environ Monit"},"articleDate":"2004-02-05","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Drainage water diverted from a farm pasture, which was heavily loaded with manure, was monitored during a rain event.

They are irreversibly micellized to give glycocluster nanoparticles (GNPs); their masked hydrophobicity endows them with remarkable saccharide specificities in the interactions with biological saccharide receptors. The GNPs also exhibit unprecedented hydrogen-bond capacities; they are agglutinated with Na(2)HPO(4) and assembled on plasmid DNA in a number-, size-, and shape-controlled manner to give artificial glycoviral particles capable of transfection. Thus, the intrinsic function of viruses, that is, cell invasion followed by gene expression, is also intrinsic to size-regulated (approximately 50 nm) glycoviruses. The growth of glycocluster amphiphiles through nanoparticles to glycoviruses reveals a hierarchical adhesion control of the saccharide clusters.","PMID":14767922,"authors":[{"lastName":"Aoyama","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yasuhiro"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12443,"articleTitle":"In vitro bioactivity of laser ablation pseudowollastonite coating.","dateCreated":"2004-01-26","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0142-9612","issnType":"Print","title":"Biomaterials","isoAbbreviation":"Biomaterials"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Pseudowollastonite (psW) coatings on titanium alloys substrates were prepared by laser ablation and immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) for different periods in order to investigate the nucleation and growth of hydroxyapatite (HA)-like formation on their surface.

Analogues of GHB, namely gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD), share its biological activity and are rapidly converted in vivo into GHB. At present, GHB and analogues are placed in the Schedules of Controlled Substances. Numerous intoxications in GHB abusers have been reported with depressive effects, seizures, coma and possibly death. The purpose of the present work was the development of a rapid analytical method based on capillary zone electrophoresis for the direct determination of GHB in human urine and serum at potentially toxic concentrations. Analytical conditions were as follows. Capillary: length 40 cm (to detector), 75 microm i.d.; buffer: 5.0 mM Na(2)HPO(4), 15 mM sodium barbital adjusted to pH 12 with 1.0 M NaOH; voltage: 25 kV at 23 degrees C; indirect UV detection at 214 nm; injection by application of 0.5 psi for 5 s. alpha-Hydroxyisobutyric acid was used as internal standard (IS). Sample pretreatment was limited to 1:8 dilution. Under these conditions, the sensitivity was approximately 3.0 microg/ml (signal-to-noise ratio >3). Calibration curves prepared in water, urine and serum were linear over concentration ranges 25-500 microg/ml with R(2)>/=0.998. Analytical precision was fairly good with R.S.D.<0.60% (including intraday and day-to-day tests). Quantitative precision in both intraday and day-to-day experiments was also very satisfactory with R.S.D.<\/=4.0%. No interferences were found neither from the most common \"drugs of abuse\" nor from endogenous compounds. In conclusion, capillary electrophoresis can offer a rapid, precise and accurate method for GHB determination of biological fluids, which could be important for screening purposes in clinical and forensic toxicology.","PMID":14698260,"authors":[{"lastName":"Bortolotti","initials":"F","foreName":"Federica"},{"lastName":"De Paoli","initials":"G","foreName":"Giorgia"},{"lastName":"Gottardo","initials":"R","foreName":"Rossella"},{"lastName":"Trattene","initials":"M","foreName":"Maristella"},{"lastName":"Tagliaro","initials":"F","foreName":"Franco"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12408,"articleTitle":"Ahaptoglobinemia (HpO) and malaria in India.","dateCreated":"2003-12-22","dateRevised":"2004-11-17","publication":{"issnNumber":"0367-8326","issnType":"Print","title":"Indian journal of malariology","isoAbbreviation":"Indian J Malariol"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism analysed among P. vivax and P. falciparum patients and malaria negative subjects from areas with different epidemiological situations had shown high incidence of ahaptoglobinemia (HpO) among malaria patients.

One way of preparing these ceramics is the sintering of a calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA), which can be obtained in different ways. Mechanochemistry is one possible means of synthesizing CDHA, with an expected molar calcium-to-phosphate (Ca/P) ratio +/- 0.005. The grinding can be carried out under dry or wet conditions. To optimize the experimental conditions of CDHA preparation by dry mechanosynthesis and for a better understanding of the DCPD/CaO mechanochemical reaction, we performed a kinetic study in which some of the experimental parameters were varied. Carried out with two different vertical rotating ball mills, this kinetic study showed that (1) experiments are reproducible and give as a final product a hydroxyapatite powder, formed of nano-sized crystals of around 20 nm, with a controlled Ca/P ratio; (2) the time for complete disappearance of DCPD and the time for complete reaction are in direct proportion to the mass of the ground powder; but (3) the time for complete disappearance of DCPD is independent of the Ca/P ratio while the time for complete reaction increases exponentially with the Ca/P ratio; and (4) the time for complete disappearance of DCPD corresponds to the time for complete reaction solely for Ca/P = 1.5. These observations suggest a reaction mechanism in two well differentiated stages: (First stage) CaO reacts with DCPD to give first an amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) with a low Ca/P ratio that transforms into CDHA when its Ca/P ratio reaches 1.5. At the same time, CaO is hydrated into Ca(OH)(2) by the water produced by the reaction. (Second stage) If the Ca/P > 1.5 in the initial mixture, the excess Ca(OH)(2) is added to CDHA 1.5 by reacting with the HPO(4) group of CDHA until its Ca/P ratio reaches the expected value. The slower the reaction, the higher the Ca/P in the initial mixture.","PMID":14613241,"authors":[{"lastName":"El Briak-BenAbdeslam","initials":"H","foreName":"Hassane"},{"lastName":"Mochales","initials":"C","foreName":"Carolina"},{"lastName":"Ginebra","initials":"MP","foreName":"Maria Pau"},{"lastName":"Nurit","initials":"J","foreName":"Josiane"},{"lastName":"Planell","initials":"JA","foreName":"Josep A"},{"lastName":"Boudeville","initials":"P","foreName":"Philippe"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12362,"articleTitle":"Transformation of effluent organic matter during subsurface wetland treatment in the Sonoran Desert.","dateCreated":"2003-11-06","dateRevised":"2010-11-18","publication":{"issnNumber":"0045-6535","issnType":"Print","title":"Chemosphere","isoAbbreviation":"Chemosphere"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during subsurface wetland treatment of wastewater effluent in a hot, semi-arid environment was examined.

Because p8 is a stress protein, we analyzed the response of p8-/- mice to a systemic stress induced by LPS injection. Liver was chosen as model organ to monitor alterations in gene expression.LPS resulted in higher serum TNF-alpha concentration and higher mortality rate in p8-deficient mice than in wild-type. Also, liver and pancreas, but not lung, from p8-/- mice showed increased amounts of MPO and HPO. To gain insight into the molecular bases of such susceptibility, we used high density DNA microarrays consisting of ~6000 genes and ESTs to compare gene regulation in response to LPS in p8+/+ and p8-/- livers.

Chemical analysis, N(2) adsorption, Hg porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the hydroxyapatite and to monitor the development of a calcium phosphate layer onto the surface of the substrate immersed in a simulated body fluid, that is, in vitro bioactivity tests. The influence of the silicon content and the nature of the starting calcium and phosphorus sources on the in vitro bioactivity of the resulting materials were studied. A sample of silicocarnotite, whose structure is related to that of hydroxyapatite and contains isolated SiO(4) (4-) anions that isomorphically substitute some PO(4) (3-) anions, was prepared and used as reference material for XPS studies. An increase of the unit cell parameters with the Si content was observed, which indicated that SiO(4) (4-) units are present in lattice positions, replacing some PO(4) (3-) groups. By using XPS it was possible to assess the presence of monomeric SiO(4) (4-) units in the surface of apatite samples containing 0.8 wt % of silicon, regardless the nature of the starting raw materials, either Ca(NO(3))(2)/(NH(4))(2)HPO(4)/Si(OCOCH(3))(4) or Ca(OH)(2)/H(3)PO(4)/Si(OCOCH(3))(4). However, an increase of the silicon content up to 1.6 wt % leads to the polymerization of the silicate species at the surface. This technique shows silicon enrichment at the surface of the three samples. The in vitro bioactivity assays showed that the formation of an apatite-like layer onto the surface of silicon-containing substrates is strongly enhanced as compared with pure silicon-free hydroxyapatite. The samples containing monomeric silicate species showed higher in vitro bioactivity than that of silicon-rich sample containing polymeric silicate species. The use of calcium and phosphate salts as precursors lead to materials with higher bioactivity.","PMID":12889007,"authors":[{"lastName":"Balas","initials":"F","foreName":"F"},{"lastName":"Pérez-Pariente","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Vallet-Regí","initials":"M","foreName":"M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12250,"articleTitle":"Flame photometric detection inside of a capillary gas chromatography column.","dateCreated":"2003-07-17","dateRevised":"2003-07-17","publication":{"issnNumber":"0003-2654","issnType":"Print","title":"The Analyst","isoAbbreviation":"Analyst"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A novel micro-flame photometric detector (FPD) employing a miniature counter-current flame is described. The micro-FPD flame, encompassing a volume of about 30 nL, is operated inside the end of a capillary gas chromatography column (i.e. on-column) or inside of a quartz capillary after the column (i.e. post-column). Either air or oxygen can support a hydrogen flame in the device, although oxygen is far preferable. The detector can be operated for several hours without any observed degradation in performance or flame stability. The optimal gas flows established for the detection of sulfur and phosphorus are in the range of 4 mL min(-1) of oxygen and 9 to 13 mL min(-1) of hydrogen. The fuel-rich micro-FPD flame generates chemiluminescent blue S2* emission for sulfur and green HPO* emission for phosphorus, similar to a conventional FPD. Sulfur response in the micro-FPD is quadratic over nearly 3 orders of magnitude while that of phosphorus is linear over nearly 5 orders of magnitude. The micro-FPD detection limit for sulfur is 1 x 10(-9) g S s(-1), and that of phosphorus is 2 x 10(-10) g P s(-1).

Amorphous calcium phosphates, prepared by precipitation from supersaturated solutions, can also react to form apatitic cements since they are thermodynamic unstable with respect to HA and have a setting reaction more independent of particle size. In this report we show for the first time that prolonged high-energy ball milling of beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), led to mechanically induced phase transformation from the crystalline to the amorphous state. The process increased the thermodynamic solubility of the beta-TCP compared to the unmilled material by up to nine times and accelerated the normally slow reaction with water. By using a 2.5% Na(2)HPO(4) solution setting times were reduced to 5-16min rather than hours. X-ray diffraction analyses indicated that the amorphous fraction within the materials was responsible for the primary setting reaction and hardening of the cements, while the crystalline fraction remained unreacted and converted only slowly to HA. Mechanically activated beta-TCP cements were produced with compressive and diametral tensile strengths of up to 50 and 7MPa respectively. The effect of preparation and setting parameters on the physical and chemical properties of mechanically activated beta-TCP cement was investigated.","PMID":12853242,"authors":[{"lastName":"Gbureck","initials":"U","foreName":"U"},{"lastName":"Grolms","initials":"O","foreName":"O"},{"lastName":"Barralet","initials":"JE","foreName":"J E"},{"lastName":"Grover","initials":"LM","foreName":"L M"},{"lastName":"Thull","initials":"R","foreName":"R"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12325,"articleTitle":"Fluorescence optosensors based on different transducers for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water.","dateCreated":"2003-09-30","dateRevised":"2016-05-12","publication":{"issnNumber":"1618-2642","issnType":"Print","title":"Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Anal Bioanal Chem"},"articleDate":"2003-07-04","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"This paper presents the development of two optosensors for the determination of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, fluoranthene and benzo[b]fluoranthene) using a photomultiplier device and an intensified coupled charge device (ICCD) as optical transducers, respectively.

Three of the cells (Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4) responded in a dose dependent manner to NaCl. The responses of Cell 2 and Cell 3 to NaCl concentrations from 1 to 500 mmol/l can be described by a logarithmic equation. The response of Cell 2 to 150 mmol/l NaCl is modulated when a buffer is added. The magnitude of the modulation of the response is determined by the nature of the buffer: NaHCO(3) inhibits while Na(2)HPO(4) enhances the response. High osmotic pressure inhibits the response of Cell 4, regardless of how it is achieved. Cell 4 responds with a high frequency to the presence of L-alanine, the C-terminal amino acid of albumin, but shows a reduced response to the same concentration of albumin.

We observed an absence of buffer catalysis using H(2)PO(4)(-)/HPO(4)(2)(-), H(3)BO(3)/H(2)BO(3)(-), and HCO(3)(-)/CO(3)(2)(-) regulators and a complex dependency of the rate constant on the pH. We discovered the existence of three simultaneous reaction paths: spontaneous decomposition of the neutral form of the N-nitrosoguanidine, decomposition of the monoanion, and decomposition through the form of the dianion. The analysis of the kinetic data has allowed us to obtain the acidity constant for the formation of the monoanion of the N-nitrosoguanidine, with values of p = 11.5. The reaction rate for the process through the monoanion, k(2), decreases as the acidity increases. The application of the principle of nonperfect synchronization shows that the basicity and reactivity do not correlate when there exists a possibility of stabilization of the negative charge by resonance. This behavior is consistent with the mechanism E1cB whereby the stabler the negative charge, the slower the elimination reaction. When dealing with the case of the elimination through the neutral form we observe that the reaction rate increases together with the capacity of stabilization of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom adjacent to the imino group.

In contrast, the product-ion spectra arising from high-energy CAD (2 keV collision energy, floating at 50%) tandem sector mass spectrometry are less applicable for isomer identification.

Fluorescence intensities were measured at lambda(ex/em) = 300/338 nm with a response time of 80 s, thus obtaining a linear concentration range of between 0 and 250.0 ng ml(-1) with a detection limit of 1.3 ng ml(-1), an analytical sensitivity of 6.0 ng ml(-1) and a standard deviation of 2.40% at a 150 ng ml(-1) concentration level for propranolol. We also propose a test to detect propranolol in urine with a linear concentration range between 0 and 100.0 ng ml(-1), a detection limit of 0.2 ng ml(-1), an analytical sensitivity of 1.0 ng ml(-1), and a standard deviation of 0.84% at a 75 ng ml(-1) concentration level. The effect of proteins presents in urine samples were evaluated. The two proposed methods were satisfactorily applied to commercial formulations and urine samples respectively.","PMID":12684098,"authors":[{"lastName":"Fernández-Sánchez","initials":"JF","foreName":"J F"},{"lastName":"Carretero","initials":"AS","foreName":"A Segura"},{"lastName":"Cruces-Blanco","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Fernández-Gutiérrez","initials":"A","foreName":"A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12142,"articleTitle":"A vanadium(IV) phosphite with a pillared layered structure: hydrothermal synthesis and characterization of (VO)4(4,4'-bpy)2(HPO3)4.","dateCreated":"2003-03-31","dateRevised":"2003-03-31","publication":{"issnNumber":"0020-1669","issnType":"Print","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A novel vanadium(IV) phosphite, (VO)(4)(4,4'-bpy)(2)(HPO(3))(4), was hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

The structure is a network of hexameric units of Ga(3)(PO(4))(3)F(2) and Ga(3)(PO(4))(2)(HPO(4))F(3) via corner sharing. It creates a three-dimensional open-framework delimiting 6- and 18-ring channels running along the c axis. The diprotonated 1,6-diaminohexane and water molecules are trapped within the 18-ring pores, whereas the rubidium cations reside in the 6-ring ones. A double quantum (31)P NMR experiment and partial charge calculations indicate that water molecules are present under the form of periodic small clusters, lowering the multiplicity of one phosphorus site, P3. Though water hops within the clusters, the motion leaves the water pattern periodic. Rubidium is so tightly embedded into the framework that water moving in the large 18-ring channels does not reach it, leaving it therefore dry.

Since activation of neutrophils by triglycerides and glucose has been described in vitro, we hypothesized that the postprandial phase is an inflammatory state affecting leukocytes, possibly contributing to endothelial dysfunction. We measured postprandial blood leukocyte counts, cytokines, hydroperoxides (HPOs), and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in eight healthy males (age 23 +/- 2 years) after a FAT (50 g/m2) and GLUCOSE challenge (37.5 g/m2), a combination of both (MIXED test), and after WATER. All tests, except WATER, resulted in significantly impaired FMD (10% reduction) between t = 1 h and t = 3 h, accompanied by a significant increase of neutrophils (59% after FAT and 28% after GLUCOSE and MIXED), total plasma HPOs (15 to 31% increase), and plasma interleukin-8 (IL-8) (50-130% increase). WATER did not affect FMD, neutrophils, HPOs, or IL-8. Lymphocytes increased gradually in all tests (40-70% increase at t = 10 h compared with t = 0; P < 0.005), paralleling a gradual 3- to 5-fold interleukin-6 increase. Monocyte and erythrocyte counts did not change in any test. In conclusion, the neutrophil increment during postprandial lipemia and glycemia with concomitant IL-8 and HPO increases may contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Lymphocyte increment is a nonspecific diurnal process. Postprandial intravascular inflammatory changes may be relevant for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.","PMID":12562833,"authors":[{"lastName":"van Oostrom","initials":"AJ","foreName":"A J H H M"},{"lastName":"Sijmonsma","initials":"TP","foreName":"T P"},{"lastName":"Verseyden","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Jansen","initials":"EH","foreName":"E H J M"},{"lastName":"de Koning","initials":"EJ","foreName":"E J P"},{"lastName":"Rabelink","initials":"TJ","foreName":"T J"},{"lastName":"Castro Cabezas","initials":"M","foreName":"M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12081,"articleTitle":"Preliminary X-ray characterization of the ribonuclease P (C5 protein) from Escherichia coli: expression, crystallization and cryoconditions.","dateCreated":"2003-01-29","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0907-4449","issnType":"Print","title":"Acta crystallographica.

In this study, six saturated sand column experiments were performed to examine the effects of a positively charged Al-oxide, which was coated on sand particles, on the retention and transport of viruses (phiX174 and MS-2) in background solutions of different ionic strength and composition. We found that the Al-oxide coating on sand significantly removed viruses during their transport in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Mass balance calculations showed that 34% of the input MS-2 was inactivated/irreversibly sorbed on the surface of Al-oxide coated sand whereas 100% of phiX174 was recovered. Results from this study also indicated that higher ionic strength facilitated the transport of both phiX174 and MS-2 through the Al-oxide coated sand. This was attributed to the effect of ion shielding, which at higher ionic strength decreased the electrostatic attraction between the viral particles and the sand surface and consequently decreased virus sorption. Strong effect of the ionic strength indicates that an outer-sphere complexation mechanism was responsible for the virus sorption on the Al-oxide coated sand. Ion composition of the background solutions was also found to be a significant factor in influencing virus retention and transport. Virus transport was enhanced in the presence of phosphate (HPO(4)(2-)) as compared to bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)), and the effect of HPO(4)(2-) was more significant on MS-2 than on phiX174. The presence of bivalent cations (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) increased virus transport because the cations partially screened the negative charges on the viruses therefore decreased the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged sand surface and the negatively charged viruses. Mass recovery data indicated that bivalent cations gave rise to a certain degree of inactivation/irreversibly sorption of phiX174 on the surface of Al-oxide coated sand. On the contrary, the bivalent cations appeared to have protected MS-2 from inactivation/irreversibly sorption. This study provides some insights into the mechanisms responsible for virus retention and transport in porous media.","PMID":12504359,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhuang","initials":"J","foreName":"Jie"},{"lastName":"Jin","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yan"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12044,"articleTitle":"A new two-dimensional molybdenum(V) nickel phosphate built up of [H18(Mo16O32)Ni16(PO4)26(OH)6(H2O)8]18- wheels.","dateCreated":"2002-12-23","dateRevised":"2003-11-04","publication":{"issnNumber":"0020-1669","issnType":"Print","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The new molybdenum(V) nickel phosphate Na(6)Ni(6)[(Mo(2)O(4))(8)Ni(16)(H(2)PO(4))(4)(HPO(4))(10)(PO(4))(12)(OH)(6)(H(2)O)(8)].66H(2)O (1) was synthesized hydrothermally.

Eight healthy mature female Saanen goats were used. The cement was applied 10min after mixing while it was still moldable and plastic. The material was given a standardized cylindrical shape. Thirty-two implants of each cement formulation were inserted and left in place for 1, 2, 4, and 8weeks. At the end of the study, eight specimens of each material and healing period were available for further analysis. Two specimens were used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and six specimens were used for light microscopical evaluation. XRD and FTIR showed that the cements did set as microcrystalline carbonate apatite with the disappearance of monetite from the cements during implantation. Histological analysis showed that after 8weeks of implantation around all materials a thin soft-tissue capsule was formed (thickness ranging from 5 to 15 cell layers) with almost complete absence of inflammatory cells. Only in some specimens a slightly higher inflammatory reaction was observed. This was due to cement surface defects and a zone of dispersed particles near the cement-soft tissue interface. There was almost no resorption of the material after 8 weeks of implantation. In a few 4 and 8weeks samples, small areas of calcification were found in the fibrous capsule surrounding the implants. On the basis of our observations, we conclude that the tested cements were biocompatible and can be used next to soft tissue.","PMID":12485793,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ooms","initials":"EM","foreName":"E M"},{"lastName":"Egglezos","initials":"EA","foreName":"E A"},{"lastName":"Wolke","initials":"JG","foreName":"J G C"},{"lastName":"Jansen","initials":"JA","foreName":"J A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12038,"articleTitle":"Dorsal skin responses to topical application with hydrogen peroxide in Mini and Wistar rats.","dateCreated":"2002-12-17","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0940-2993","issnType":"Print","title":"Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie","isoAbbreviation":"Exp.

While hair follicles of MRs of this age are under a long-lasting telogen phase after their 2nd cycle, a new hair cycle started not only in the HPO-applied area but also in the solvent-applied area with a little time lag.

The method, called phosphorus relaxation enhancement (PhoRE), uses (1)H-detected (31)P NMR of exogenous probe ions to monitor changes in the equilibrium between free Mn(2+) and Mn(2+) bound to the RNA. To demonstrate the technique, we describe the interactions of four RNA molecules with metal ions (K(+) and Mg(2+)), a small molecule drug (neomycin b), and a cationic peptide (RSG1.2). In each case, cationic ligand binding caused Mn(2+) to be displaced from the RNA. Free Mn(2+) was determined from its effect on the T(2) NMR relaxation rate of either phosphite (HPO(3)(2-)) or methyl phosphite (MeOPH, CH(3)OP(H)O(2-)). Using this method, the effects of [RNA] as low as 1 microM could be measured in 20 min of accumulation using a low field (200 MHz) instrument without pulsed field gradients. Cation association behavior was sequence and [RNA] dependent. At low [K(+)], Mn(2+) association with each of the RNAs decreased with increasing [K(+)] until approximately 40 mM, where saturation was reached. While saturating K(+) displaced all the bound Mn(2+) from a 31-nucleotide poly-uridine (U(31)), Mn(2+) remained bound to each of three hairpin-forming sequences (A-site, RRE1, and RRE2), even at 150 mM K(+). Bound Mn(2+) was displaced from each of the hairpins by Mg(2+), allowing determination of Mg(2+) dissociation constants (K(d,Mg)) ranging from 50 to 500 microM, depending on the RNA sequence and [K(+)]. Both neomycin b and RSG1.2 displaced Mn(2+) upon binding the hairpins. At [RNA] approximately 3 microM, RRE1 bound a single equivalent of RSG1.2, whereas neither RRE2 nor A-site bound the peptide. These behaviors were confirmed by fluorescence polarization using TAMRA-labeled peptide. At 2.7 microM RNA, the A-site hairpin bound a single neomycin b molecule. The selectivity of RSG1.2 binding was greatly diminished at higher [RNA]. Similarly, each hairpin bound multiple equivalents of neomycin at the higher [RNA]. These results demonstrate the utility of the PhoRE method for characterizing metal binding behaviors of nucleic acids and for studying RNA/ligand interactions.","PMID":12475335,"authors":[{"lastName":"Summers","initials":"JS","foreName":"Jack S"},{"lastName":"Shimko","initials":"J","foreName":"John"},{"lastName":"Freedman","initials":"FL","foreName":"Fredric L"},{"lastName":"Badger","initials":"CT","foreName":"Christopher T"},{"lastName":"Sturgess","initials":"M","foreName":"Michael"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12019,"articleTitle":"Hemolytic characteristics of oxygenators during clinical extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","dateCreated":"2002-11-28","dateRevised":"2006-05-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"1058-2916","issnType":"Print","title":"ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)","isoAbbreviation":"ASAIO J."},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"A connection was previously reported between the hemolytic characteristics associated with oxygenators and the pressure drop measurements in the blood chamber under experimental conditions simulating their use in cardiopulmonary bypass.

Compared to the culture pH prior to desiccation, a drop of up to 2.2 pH units was observed, dependent upon the volume and pH of 1 M MgSO(4) used (1-30 x original culture volume, using 1 M MgSO(4) in the pH range 5.4-7.6). This pH drop appears to be due to the removal of the HPO(4)(2-) buffer capacity of the medium by the formation of insoluble Mg(3)(PO(4))(2) and the release of free H(+) ions. As a result of this lower pH, markedly reduced culture viability was observed over an 8-h period at 37 degrees C for vaccines re-suspended in 1 M MgSO(4) (ca. 6 log(10) drop in titre) compared to re-suspension in dH(2)O (ca. 1.5 log(10) drop in titre).

It has been hypothesized that the signal for initiating the injury response is dependent on retrograde transport, where the signal itself is either the loss of a repressor substance from the periphery or the loss of retrogradely transported target-derived factors. To examine if a retrograde transport-mediated signal would be sufficient to produce the rapid ribosomal effects observed in hamster FMN following injury, adult hamsters were subjected to right facial nerve axotomies, with the neuronal tracer wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP; M.W. 80,000) applied at the proximal stump of the transected nerve. At time points ranging from 0.5 to 24 hours postoperative (hpo), the animals were killed and brainstem sections containing bilateral facial nuclei processed for WGA-HRP label using the TMB method. The earliest time point at which WGA-HRP was detected in the axotomized facial nucleus occurred at 3 hpo. To eliminate molecular weight as a confounding factor, an additional retrograde transport study was performed using the smaller tracer, Fluoro-Gold (M.W. 532.59). Fluoro-Gold was not detected until well after the 3 hpo time point.

However, several differences were also discovered: (i) Plasmodium-specific inhibition of the inositol acyltransferase was detected with GlcN-[L]-PI, while GlcN-(2-O-alkyl)PI weakly inhibited the first mannosyltransferase in a competitive manner. (ii) The Plasmodium de-N-acetylase can act on analogues containing N-benzoyl, GalNAc, or betaGlcNAc whereas the human enzyme cannot. Using the parasite specificity of the later two analogues with the known nonspecific de-N-acetylase suicide inhibitor [Smith, T. K., et al. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 3322-3332], GalNCONH(2)-PI and GlcNCONH(2)-beta-PI were designed and found to be potent (IC(50) approximately 0.2 microM), Plasmodium-specific suicide substrate inhibitors. These inhibitors could be potential lead compounds for the development of antimalaria drugs.","PMID":12369829,"authors":[{"lastName":"Smith","initials":"TK","foreName":"Terry K"},{"lastName":"Gerold","initials":"P","foreName":"Peter"},{"lastName":"Crossman","initials":"A","foreName":"Arthur"},{"lastName":"Paterson","initials":"MJ","foreName":"Michael J"},{"lastName":"Borissow","initials":"CN","foreName":"Charles N"},{"lastName":"Brimacombe","initials":"JS","foreName":"John S"},{"lastName":"Ferguson","initials":"MA","foreName":"Michael A J"},{"lastName":"Schwarz","initials":"RT","foreName":"Ralph T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12030,"articleTitle":"Partial structure of glutamic acid and alanine-rich protein, a major surface glycoprotein of the insect stages of Trypanosoma congolense.","dateCreated":"2002-12-09","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9258","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of biological chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Here, we describe the purification and structural characterization of the glutamic acid and alanine-rich protein, one of the major surface glycoproteins of T. congolense procyclic and epimastigote forms.

The 21.6-kDa polypeptide component carries two large mannose- and galactose-containing oligosaccharides linked to threonine residues via phosphodiester linkages.

The genes encoding this activity are PIG-L and GPI12 in mammals and yeast, respectively. Fragments of putative GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase genes from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major were identified in the respective genome project data bases. The full-length genes TbGPI12 and LmGPI12 were subsequently cloned, sequenced, and shown to complement a PIG-L-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line and restore surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. A tetracycline-inducible bloodstream form T. brucei TbGPI12 conditional null mutant cell line was created and analyzed under nonpermissive conditions. TbGPI12 mRNA levels were reduced to undetectable levels within 8 h of tetracycline removal, and the cells died after 3-4 days. This demonstrates that TbGPI12 is an essential gene for the tsetse-transmitted parasite that causes Nagana in cattle and African sleeping sickness in humans. It also validates GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase as a potential drug target against these diseases. Washed parasite membranes were prepared from the conditional null mutant parasites after 48 h without tetracycline.

L. monocytogenes cells grown in LB media with lower concentrations of glucose showed higher adhesion to Caco-2 cells (3,716 and 4,186 cpm of attached bacteria for 0 and 0.2 g of glucose/liter, respectively), while L. monocytogenes cells grown in LB with higher glucose concentrations exhibited lower adhesion (2,126 and 2,221 cpm for 1.6 and 3.2 g of glucose/liter, respectively). A LAP-negative L. monocytogenes strain (A572) showed low adhesion profiles regardless of the amount of glucose added. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that LAP is localized mainly in the cytoplasm, with only a few molecules located on the cell surface. Growth in LB with high glucose (3.2 g/liter) showed the presence of only a few molecules in the cells, corroborating the results observed with ELISA or immunoblotting. In summary, nutrient-rich media and high concentrations of glucose suppressed LAP expression, which possibly is due to the changes in the pH of the media during growth from the accumulation of sugar fermentation by-products.","PMID":12324334,"authors":[{"lastName":"Jaradat","initials":"ZW","foreName":"Ziad W"},{"lastName":"Bhunia","initials":"AK","foreName":"Arun K"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11955,"articleTitle":"Controlled synthesis of hydroxyapatite-supported palladium complexes as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts.","dateCreated":"2002-09-25","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0002-7863","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Recently, we demonstrated that the extracellular ligand form of HPO can stimulate proliferation of hepatic cells via its specific receptor, which is on the surface of these cells.

In this study, we screened a human fetal liver cDNA library using the yeast two hybrid system with HPO as bait, hoping to find an HPO-binding protein. Surprisingly, HPO, itself, and a previously unidentified alternatively spliced form of HPO (named HPO23) were identified as interacting with HPO, indicating that HPO may exist as a homodimer or heterodimer. These results were further confirmed in vitro and in vivo. First, mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant human HPO exist as a homodimer and that disulfide bonds were involved in the formation of rhHPO dimer. Secondly, a pull-down experiment confirmed that GST-HPO and HA-HPO, could bind together in vitro. Using HPO and various HPO deletion mutants, we identified the extreme 30 amino acids at both N- and C-termini are essential for HPO dimerization. Finally, Western blotting analysis demonstrated that HPO exists as two isoforms at 15 kDa and 23 kDa (HPO23) in liver cells, the 15 kDa species is located in nucleus, and the 23 kDa species mainly in the cytoplasm. These results implicated that the capacity of HPO to form both homodimers and heterodimers with the alternatively spliced forms might contribute to the existence of various HPO complexes in hepatic cells.","PMID":12180965,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yong"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"K","foreName":"Kaihua"},{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"C","foreName":"Chengrong"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yingxian"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"M","foreName":"Ming"},{"lastName":"Xing","initials":"G","foreName":"Guichun"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"H","foreName":"Handong"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qingming"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"J","foreName":"Jizhong"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"C","foreName":"Chutse"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"H","foreName":"Huipeng"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"S","foreName":"Songcheng"},{"lastName":"He","initials":"F","foreName":"Fuchu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11913,"articleTitle":"Statistical media optimization and production of ITS alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae in a bioreactor.","dateCreated":"2002-08-14","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0343-8651","issnType":"Print","title":"Current microbiology","isoAbbreviation":"Curr.

The preservation of peritoneal membrane function is essential for successful peritoneal dialysis. Two main factors are responsible for long-term loss of membrane function. Peritonitis, the major complication of CAPD, can be life-threatening and lead to more rapid failure of the technique. The other factor is continuous exposure of peritoneal membrane to bioincompatible dialysis solutions. To investigate the role of repeated peritonitis on peritoneal membrane function, we performed a retrospective study to elucidate the association between peritonitis episodes and peritoneal membrane solute transport characteristics.From 1996-2000, 32 pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients were included in this study. According to the peritonitis occurrence frequency, 8 patients were divided into HPO group (peritonitis occurrence rate > or = 5 times/year), and 24 patients were divided into LPO group (peritonitis occurrence rate < or = 1 time/year). The mean age of study patients was 13.95 +/- 5.27 years. The peritoneal equilibration test was performed to evaluate the peritoneal membrane dialyzing function.The mean duration of peritoneal dialysis was 3.31 +/- 1.08 years. The change of peritoneal solute transport (AD/P), computed by subtraction of 4-hour D/P at baseline PET study from that at the last follow-up PET study, showed significant difference (p < 0.05) between HPO (-0.234 + 0.074) and LPO (-0.040 +/- 0.079) groups of children. There was also a significant correlation between repeated peritonitis occurrence and PET deterioration(p < 0.05). The relative risk was 2.63.Children with frequent peritonitis occurrence have significant decreasing peritoneal solute transport and decreasing PET scaling in follow-up period.","PMID":12166764,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"HH","foreName":"Hsin-Hui"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"CY","foreName":"Ching-Yuang"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11901,"articleTitle":"Hexakis(melaminium) tetrakis(dihydrogenphosphate) monohydrogenphosphate tetrahydrate.","dateCreated":"2002-08-02","dateRevised":"2003-11-03","publication":{"issnNumber":"0108-2701","issnType":"Print","title":"Acta crystallographica.

The assays measured the abilities of the analogues to act as substrates or inhibitors of the enzymes of glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis downstream of GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol (GlcNAc-PI) de-N-acetylase. One compound, 4-deoxy-d-GlcN alpha 1-6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO(4)-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, proved to be an inhibitor of both the trypanosomal and HeLa pathways, whereas 4-O-methyl-d-GlcN alpha 1-6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO(4)-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol and the 4'-epimer, d-GalN-alpha1-6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO(4)-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, were neither substrates nor inhibitors. The results with other analogues showed that the 6-OH of the alpha-d-GlcN residue is not required for substrate recognition in the trypanosomal and human pathways, whereas the 3-OH group is essential for both. Parasite-specific recognition of the beta-linked analogue d-GlcN beta 1-6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO(4)-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol is striking. This suggests that, like the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase, the trypanosomal glycosylphosphatidylinositol alpha-mannosyltransferases, inositol acyltransferse and ethanolamine phosphate transferase, do not recognize the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-OH groups of the d-myo-inositol residue, whereas the human inositol acyltransferase and/or first alpha-mannosyltransferase recognizes one or more of these groups. All of the various lipid analogues tested served as substrates in both the trypanosomal and HeLa cell-free systems, suggesting that a precise lipid structure and stereochemistry are not essential for substrate recognition. However, an analogue containing a single C18:0 alkyl chain in place of sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol proved to be a better substrate in the trypanosomal than in the HeLa cell-free system. These findings should have a bearing on the design of future generations of specific inhibitors of the trypanosomal glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthetic pathway.","PMID":12147686,"authors":[{"lastName":"Smith","initials":"TK","foreName":"Terry K"},{"lastName":"Crossman","initials":"A","foreName":"Arthur"},{"lastName":"Paterson","initials":"MJ","foreName":"Michael J"},{"lastName":"Borissow","initials":"CN","foreName":"Charles N"},{"lastName":"Brimacombe","initials":"JS","foreName":"John S"},{"lastName":"Ferguson","initials":"MA","foreName":"Michael A J"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11880,"articleTitle":"Characterization of a novel calcium phosphate/sulphate bone cement.","dateCreated":"2002-07-12","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9304","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of biomedical materials research","isoAbbreviation":"J.

To assure that new bone tissue grows into the bone defect, a certain porosity is necessary although hard to achieve in injectable cements with suitable mechanical properties. An attempt was made by mixing alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP), calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CSH) and an aqueous solution containing 2.5 wt% of Na(2)HPO(4). The aim was to obtain a material containing two phases: a) one apatitic phase (calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite; CDHA) and b) one resorbable phase (calcium sulphate dihydrate; CSD). alpha-TCP and CSH mixtures were produced at relative intervals of 20 wt%. The liquid-to-powder (L/P) ratio to obtain a paste was 0.32 mLg(-1). The highest compressive strength (34 MPa) was obtained for the pure alpha-TCP sample. The strength was, in a first approximation, directly correlated to the weight proportions of the powders. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the relative intensity for CDHA increased linearly, and the one for CSD decreased exponentially, when the amount of alpha-TCP increased. Thus, CSH ceased to transform to CSD when the amount of alpha-TCP increased. Observations in environmental scanning electron microscopy confirmed the X-ray diffraction results. CSH-crystals (100 microm) were embedded in the HA-matrix permitting gradual porosity in the material when resorbed.","PMID":12115450,"authors":[{"lastName":"Nilsson","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Fernández","initials":"E","foreName":"E"},{"lastName":"Sarda","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Lidgren","initials":"L","foreName":"L"},{"lastName":"Planell","initials":"JA","foreName":"J A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11871,"articleTitle":"Reactivity and selectivity of the N-acetyl-Glu-P-1, N-acetyl-Glu-P-2, N-acetyl-MeIQx, and N-acetyl-IQx nitrenium ions: comparison to carbocyclic N-arylnitrenium ions.","dateCreated":"2002-07-03","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0002-7863","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The less reactive esters 1a and 1b also undergo acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis to generate the corresponding hydroxamic acids at pH <2, while the more reactive 2c and 2d are prone to rearrangement in nonaqueous solvents. The reactions of the nitrenium ions with AcO(-), HPO(4)(2-), N(3)(-), and 2'-deoxyguanosine (d-G) were characterized in aqueous solution by using a combination of competitive trapping methods and product isolation and identification. The reactions with N(3)(-) and d-G generally follow patterns previously established for carbocyclic nitrenium ions, but the reactions with AcO(-) and HPO(4)(2-) are unusual. Similar reactions have previously only been reported for heterocyclic 1-alkyl-2-imidazolium ions. The N(3)(-)/solvent selectivities of these ions (5.1 x 10(6) M(-1) for 2a, 2.3 x 10(6) M(-1) for 2b, 1.2 x 10(5) M(-1) for 2c, and 5.2 x 10(4) M(-1) for 2d) are comparable to those of highly selective carbocyclic nitrenium ions. If k(az) for these ions is diffusion limited at ca. 5 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) the aqueous solution lifetimes of these ions range from 10 micros (2d) to 1 ms (2a). These ions are also highly selective for trapping by d-G, but comparisons to other nitrenium ions show that they are 10- to 50-fold less selective for trapping by d-G than they would be if both the N(3)(-) and d-G reactions were diffusion limited. This is not a consequence of their heterocyclic structures. Several carbocyclic ions show similar behavior. The relatively inefficient trapping of 2c and 2d by d-G may account for the observation of the unusual minor N-2 d-G adduct that is isolated for both of these nitrenium ions, but has not previously been observed for the reactions of other nitrenium ions with monomeric d-G.","PMID":12095341,"authors":[{"lastName":"Novak","initials":"M","foreName":"Michael"},{"lastName":"Toth","initials":"K","foreName":"Krisztina"},{"lastName":"Rajagopal","initials":"S","foreName":"Sridharan"},{"lastName":"Brooks","initials":"M","foreName":"Michael"},{"lastName":"Hott","initials":"LL","foreName":"Lora L"},{"lastName":"Moslener","initials":"M","foreName":"Matthew"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11870,"articleTitle":"N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediammonium hydrogenphosphate monohydrate.","dateCreated":"2002-07-02","dateRevised":"2003-11-03","publication":{"issnNumber":"0108-2701","issnType":"Print","title":"Acta crystallographica.

Under these successive conditions, the rate of initial reduction of Fe(III)Blm became progressively slower and biphasic. Using 7.5 base pairs per-molecule of FeBlm, 2-3 times as much drug reacted in the faster step as with the larger DNA to drug ratio. In each case, the more rapid process was identified with the reaction of high spin Fe(III)Blm-DNA. With the smaller ratio, dioxygen consumption, formation of HO(2)-Fe(III)Blm-DNA, and production of DNA strand breaks as measured by the formation of base propenal were largely rate limited by the initial reaction of ascorbate with Fe(III)Blm-DNA. After a burst of reaction with the larger ratio of base pairs to Fe(III)Blm, a small fraction of the total Fe(III)Blm, representing high spin Fe(III)Blm, entered a steady state as HO(2)-Fe(III)Blm-DNA. Thereafter, reaction of dioxygen and base propenal formation occurred slowly with similar first-order rate kinetics. In order to explain these results, it is hypothesized that the metal domain-linker of Fe(III)Blm adopts two conformations with respect to DNA. One, at specific binding sites, is relatively unreactive with ascorbate. The other, present at non-specific sites as HPO(4)-Fe(III)Blm, is readily reactive with ascorbate to generate HO(2)-Fe(III)Blm-DNA. At the larger base pair to drug ratio, movement of Fe(III)Blm between specific and non-specific sites to generate HO(2)-Fe(III)Blm is a necessary part of the mechanism of strand scission.","PMID":12009250,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"W","foreName":"Wenbao"},{"lastName":"Antholine","initials":"WE","foreName":"William E"},{"lastName":"Petering","initials":"DH","foreName":"David H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11821,"articleTitle":"Simultaneous determination of clomipramine and its desmethyl and hydroxy metabolites in plasma of patients by high-performance liquid chromatography after solid-phase extraction.","dateCreated":"2002-05-14","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1570-0232","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of chromatography.

In particular, limited information is available on the correlation with clinical response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study describes a new sensitive method to simultaneously determine CMI and its major N-desmethylated and hydroxy-metabolites present in human plasma by HPLC with a UV detector. After a solid-phase extraction from plasma (Isolute C2 columns) the separation of the compounds was performed on a Lichrospher CN column (250 x 4 mm, 5 microm with a 2-cm pre-column) by an eluent consisting of 10 mM K(2)HPO(4)-acetonitrile-methanol (35:25:40 v/v/v) at a flow of 1.5 ml/min.

This method is simple, fast and reliable with good specificity and sensitivity. Solid phase extraction is efficient and rapid, allowing the extraction of several plasma samples on the same day and may therefore be usefully and realistically applied in the clinical context.

The initial step in the evaluation of the disease includes detailed clinical history, followed by complete physical examination. Laboratory tests should include coagulation profile, complete blood count with platelet evaluation, and sometimes a serum pregnancy test. The treatment of DUB is related to the severity of symptomatology with the objective of stopping bleeding and preventing recurrences. The importance of continued follow-up in DUB cases should be underlined, until stabilization of ovulatory menstrual cycles.","PMID":11935691,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deligeoroglou","initials":"E","foreName":"E"},{"lastName":"Fotaki","initials":"P","foreName":"P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11779,"articleTitle":"Homocysteine and steroids levels in metformin treated women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","dateCreated":"2002-04-02","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0947-7349","issnType":"Print","title":"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association","isoAbbreviation":"Exp.

Treatment of ovariectomized monkeys with nandrolone decanoate results in an increase in bone mass to levels comparable to those of intact animals. The changes in bone composition that occur with these treatments, however, are less well characterized. In the present study, we used synchrotron Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FT-IRM) and curve-fitting methods to monitor specific changes at cortical, subchondral, and trabecular bone regions in the proximal tibia. Four groups were studied: (1) sham-operated (sham); (2) ovariectomized and treated with placebo for 2 years (ovx); (3) ovx + nandrolone decanoate for 2 years (NAN); and (4) ovx + nandrolone decanoate beginning 1 year after ovx (dNAN). The results demonstrate that ovariectomy and nandrolone treatment did not affect the degree of mineralization as defined by the phosphate/protein ratio, but acid phosphate content (HPO(4)(2-)) in cortical and subchondral bone was increased by ovariectomy, suggesting this bone to be less mature due to increased remodeling that occurs after ovariectomy. In the subchondral and cortical bone regions, ovariectomized monkeys showed a lower total carbonate content (CO(3)(2-)/matrix ratio) than sham controls, specifically due to the decrease in labile carbonate content. In the trabecular region, no change of carbonate content was observed. Treatment with nandrolone decanoate was found to restore the loss in carbonate, where the resulting mineral had a larger quantity of type B carbonate. Finally, we correlated carbonate content with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements, and found a positive correlation between bone mineral density and type A carbonate in bone, which is stoichiometrically related to the amount of calcium in bone. Therefore, the results presented herein identify significant differences in bone chemistry after ovariectomy and nandrolone treatment, which may help explain previous findings that, although nandrolone decanoate treatment increased bone mass, it could not reverse the decrease in bone strength due to ovariectomy.","PMID":11882463,"authors":[{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"RY","foreName":"R Y"},{"lastName":"Miller","initials":"LM","foreName":"L M"},{"lastName":"Carlson","initials":"CS","foreName":"C S"},{"lastName":"Chance","initials":"MR","foreName":"M R"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11752,"articleTitle":"Hepatopoietin acts as an autocrine growth factor in hepatoma cells.","dateCreated":"2002-03-06","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1044-5498","issnType":"Print","title":"DNA and cell biology","isoAbbreviation":"DNA Cell Biol."},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Hepatopoietin (HPO) is a novel human hepatotrophic factor.

The appropriate rate laws were established. The reactions of the different ligands occur at very similar rates, though the uninegatively charged singly deprotonated form reacts about 1 order of magnitude faster than the neutral form of the same ligand. The results can conveniently be interpreted in terms of a dissociative interchange mechanism which postulates the formation of an intermediate complex in which the ligand is coordinated to only one Fe(III) center of the hydroxo dimer. In a subsequent fast step, the ligand forms a bridge between the two metal ions by replacing one of the OH groups. The dissociation of the dinuclear complex into FeL most likely proceeds via the same intermediate.","PMID":11874369,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lente","initials":"G","foreName":"Gábor"},{"lastName":"Fábián","initials":"I","foreName":"István"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11750,"articleTitle":"Removal of arsenite from aqueous solutions by anionic clays.","dateCreated":"2002-03-04","dateRevised":"2007-03-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0959-3330","issnType":"Print","title":"Environmental technology","isoAbbreviation":"Environ Technol"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Layered double hydroxides are antitype 2/1 clay minerals that can be synthesized rapidly under laboratory conditions.

For example, the enzymes superoxide dismutase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and acetylcholinesterase can steer ligands toward their oppositely charged binding pockets or gorges. Interestingly, in our Brownian dynamics simulations of a phosphate-binding protein, we discovered that negatively charged phosphate (HPO(2-)(4)) could make its way into the negatively charged binding pocket. In fact, the phosphate-binding protein exhibits counterintuitive kinetics of association. That is, one would expect that the rate of association would increase on increases to the ionic strength since the interaction between the ligand, with a charge of -2, and the electronegative binding pocket would be repulsive and greater screening should reduce this repulsion and increase the rate of association. However, the opposite is seen-i.e., the rate of association decreases on increases in the ionic strength. We used Brownian dynamics techniques to compute the diffusion limited association rate constants between the negatively charged phosphate ligand and several open forms of PBP (wild-type and several mutants based on an x-ray structure of open-form PBP, mutant T141D). With the appropriate choices of reaction criteria and molecular parameters, the ligand was able to diffuse into the binding pocket. A number of residues influence binding of the ligand within the pocket via hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. Arg135 partially neutralizes the charges on the HPO(2-)(4) ligand in the binding pocket, allowing it to enter. It is also found that the positive electrostatic patches above and below the binding entrance of PBP contribute the major attractive forces that direct the ligand toward the surface of the protein near the binding site.","PMID":11807752,"authors":[{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"HC","foreName":"Hung-Chung"},{"lastName":"Briggs","initials":"JM","foreName":"James M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11696,"articleTitle":"The effect of salts on the micellization temperature of aqueous poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) solutions and the dissolution rate and water diffusion coefficient in their corresponding gels.","dateCreated":"2002-01-09","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0022-3549","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of pharmaceutical sciences","isoAbbreviation":"J Pharm Sci"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Studies were performed to examine the effect of ionic salts on phase transitions, dissolution rates, and diffusion coefficients of water in gels of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) with polymer concentrations ranging from 22 to 32% w/w and salt concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.5% w/w.

Calculated quotients between the overall and reactive rate constants for the quenching of O(2)((1)Delta(g)) by Tyr-derivatives (k(t)/k(r) values, accounting for the efficiency of the effective photooxidation) were 1.3 for Tyr, 1 for Tyr-Val, 2.8 for Val-Tyr and 1.5 for Val-Tyr-Val. The effect of pH on the kinetics of the photooxidative process confirms that the presence of the dissociated phenolate group of Tyr clearly dominates the O(2)((1)Delta(g)) quenching process. Products analysis by LC-MS indicates that the photooxidation of Tyr di- and tripeptides proceeds with the breakage of peptide bonds. The information obtained from the evolution of primary amino groups upon photosensitized irradiation is in concordance with these results. Absolute rate constants for the reactions of phosphate radicals (HPO(4)(*-) and PO(4)(*2-), generated by photolysis of the P(2)O(8)(4-) at different pH) and sulfate radicals (SO(4)(*-), produced by photolysis of the S(2)O(8)(2-)) with Tyr peptides indicate that for all the substrates, the observed tendency in the rate constants is: SO(4)(*-) > or = HPO(4)(*-) > or = PO(4)(*2-). Formation of the phenoxyl radical of tyrosine was detected as an intermediate involved in the oxidation of tyrosine by HPO(4)(*-).","PMID":11748007,"authors":[{"lastName":"Criado","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Marioli","initials":"JM","foreName":"J M"},{"lastName":"Allegretti","initials":"PE","foreName":"P E"},{"lastName":"Furlong","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Rodríguez Nieto","initials":"FJ","foreName":"F J"},{"lastName":"Mártire","initials":"DO","foreName":"D O"},{"lastName":"García","initials":"NA","foreName":"N A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11668,"articleTitle":"Cellular zinc content is a major determinant of iron chelator-induced apoptosis of thymocytes.","dateCreated":"2001-12-12","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0006-4971","issnType":"Print","title":"Blood","isoAbbreviation":"Blood"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Desferrioxamine (DFO) and the hydroxypiridinone (HPO) deferiprone (CP20) chelate iron as well as other metals. These chelators are used clinically to treat iron overload, but they induce apoptosis in thymocytes. Thymocyte apoptosis is potentiated by zinc deficiency, suggesting that these iron chelators may induce apoptosis by depleting stores of zinc. Exposure of murine thymocytes to either DFO or deferiprone resulted in significant reductions in the labile intracellular zinc pool. Moreover, increasing intracellular zinc levels, by chronic zinc dietary supplementation to mice or in vitro loading with zinc, abrogated deferiprone-induced murine thymocyte apoptosis. Bidentate hydroxypyridinones such as deferiprone interact with intracellular zinc pools in a manner distinct from that of DFO, which is a hexadentate iron chelator. Whereas deferiprone acts synergistically with the zinc chelator NNNN-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) to induce apoptosis, DFO does not. This difference is most likely due to the ability of HPOs but not DFO to \"shuttle\" zinc onto acceptors such as metallothioneins. By nature of its structure, DFO is larger than deferiprone and is thus less able to access some intracellular zinc pools. Additionally, metal complexes of DFO are more stable than those of HPOs and thus are less likely to donate zinc to other acceptors. The ability of deferiprone to preferentially access zinc pools was also demonstrated by inhibition of a zinc-containing enzyme phospholipase C, particularly when combined with TPEN. These findings suggest that bidentate iron chelators access intracellular zinc pools not available to DFO and that zinc chelation is a mechanism of apoptotic induction by such chelators in thymocytes.","PMID":11739193,"authors":[{"lastName":"Maclean","initials":"KH","foreName":"K H"},{"lastName":"Cleveland","initials":"JL","foreName":"J L"},{"lastName":"Porter","initials":"JB","foreName":"J B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11656,"articleTitle":"Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopic investigation of the maturation of nonstoichiometric apatites in mineralized tissues: a horse dentin study.","dateCreated":"2001-11-30","dateRevised":"2003-11-14","publication":{"issnNumber":"8756-3282","issnType":"Print","title":"Bone","isoAbbreviation":"Bone"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIRM) was used to study carbonated apatite/collagen interactions and maturation in horse secondary dentin.

Crystals close to the mineralization front were very immature, showing high HPO(4) and very low CO(3) levels. Carbonate ions were located essentially in very labile, reactive environments, probably on the crystal surface. Removal of some of the HPO(4) ions from crystals during maturation was linked to an increase in total carbonate content. The CO(3) ions in labile environments decreased, probably after incorporation into more organized regions of the lattice. However, this increase of total carbonate content was associated with greater mineral crystallinity, confirming findings in other studies of synthetic apatite maturation in vitro.

Of them, only hepatopoietin (HPO)/ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) is a specifically hepatotrophic factor originally identified from the cytosol of regenerating or hyperplastic hepatic cells. Previous reports indicate that extracellular HPO triggers the MAPK pathway by binding its specific receptor on the cell surface. However, its function in the cytosol of hepatocytes is unclear. Here we identified that JAB1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1), a co-activator of AP-1, which is essential for liver regeneration, specifically interacts with intracellular HPO. JAB1 colocalizes with HPO in nuclei of hepatic cells or COS-7 cells. As an intracrine factor, the intracellular function of HPO is to increase c-Jun phosphorylation independent of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) -1 and -2, and leads to potentiation of JAB1-mediated AP-1 activation. Amino acids 1-63 of HPO molecule are sufficient to bind to JAB1, but the full-length HPO is necessary for its intracellular signaling. Taken together, these results elucidate a novel mechanism of intracrine cytokine signaling by specifically modulating the AP-1 pathway through JAB1, in a MAPK-independent fashion.","PMID":11709497,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lu","initials":"C","foreName":"Chengrong"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yong"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yanlin"},{"lastName":"Xing","initials":"G","foreName":"Guichin"},{"lastName":"Tang","initials":"F","foreName":"Fei"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Q","foreName":"Qingming"},{"lastName":"Sun","initials":"Y","foreName":"Yuhui"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"H","foreName":"Handong"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"X","foreName":"Xiaoming"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"C","foreName":"Chutse"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"J","foreName":"Jianguo"},{"lastName":"Guan","initials":"KL","foreName":"Kun-Liang"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"C","foreName":"Chenggang"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"H","foreName":"Huipeng"},{"lastName":"He","initials":"F","foreName":"Fuchu"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11624,"articleTitle":"LC determination of cephalosporins in in vitro rat intestinal sac absorption model.","dateCreated":"2001-10-29","dateRevised":"2014-11-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"0731-7085","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis","isoAbbreviation":"J Pharm Biomed Anal"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Cefotaxime sodium (CX) and Ceftazidime pentahydrate (CZ) are peptidomimetic cephalosporins (CPS) which exist as zwitterionic compounds at physiological pH and because of this reason they are not absorbed appreciably on peroral administration.

In present work a simple validated HPLC method utilizing isocratic mobile phase and having short retention times for CX and CZ is developed which can be used to monitor their concentrations in Kreb's Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) solution in in vitro intestinal sac absorption model. The same was utilized to determine apparent permeability coefficients and absorption profiles of CPS by modified Wilson-Wiseman method. The CPS were analysed by the reverse phase HPLC method using Shim-pack C18 column. The mobile phase used was of isocratic composition with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 3.5 g/l of KH(2)PO(4) dissolved in 0.03 M Na(2)HPO(4).2H(2)O) and methanol in proportion 85:15 for CZ and 70:30 for CX.

All constituent magnetic centers are supposed to possess well-isolated orbitally non-degenerate ground states so that the isotropic Heisenberg-Dirac-Van Vleck (HDVV) term is the leading part of the exchange spin Hamiltonian. Along with the HDVV term, we consider higher-order isotropic exchange terms (biquadratic exchange), as well as the anisotropic terms (anisotropic and antisymmetric exchange interactions and local single-ion anisotropies). All these terms are expressed as irreducible tensor operators (ITO). This allows us to take full advantage of the spin symmetry of the system. At the same time, we have also benefitted by taking into account the point group symmetry of the cluster, which allows us to work with symmetrized spin functions. This results in an additional reduction of the matrices to diagonalize. The approach developed here is accompanied by an efficient computational procedure that allows us to calculate the bulk magnetic properties (magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and magnetic specific heat) as well as the spectroscopic properties of HNSC. Special attention is paid to calculate the magnetic excitations observed by inelastic neutron scattering (INS), their intensities, and their Q and temperature dependencies. This spectroscopic technique provides direct access to the energies and wave functions of the different spin states of the cluster; thus, it can be applied to spin clusters in order to obtain deep and detailed information on the nature of the magnetic exchange phenomenon. The general expression for the INS cross-section of spin clusters interacting by all kinds of exchange interactions, including also the single-ion zero-field splitting term, is derived for the first time. A closed-form expression is also derived for the particular case in which only the isotropic exchange interactions are involved.

HPOs with substituents at the 1- and 2-positions of the pyridinone ring have been synthesized, and their inhibitory properties compared with those of desferrioxamine (DFO). Varying the alkyl substituents does not affect the affinity constant of these ligands for iron(III), but permits a systematic investigation of the effect of hydrophobicity and molecular shape on inhibitory properties. The inhibition of RR was monitored, indirectly by measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA and directly by the quantification of the EPR signal of the enzyme tyrosyl radical. 5-LO inhibition was examined spectrophotometrically, measuring the rate of linoleic hydroperoxide formation by soybean lipoxygenase. The results indicate that the substituent size introduced at the 2-position of the HPO ring is critical for determining inhibition of both enzymes. Large substituents on the 2-position, introduce a steric factor which interferes with accessibility to the iron centers. These studies have identified chelators such as 1,6-dimethyl-2-(N-4',N-propylsuccinamido)methyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP358), which causes only a 10% inhibition of 5-LO after 24 h of incubation at 110 microm IBE (iron-binding equivalents) in comparison to simple dialkyl HPOs such as Deferiprone (CP20) which cause up to 70% inhibition. Using EPR spectroscopy, CP358 inhibits RR at a slower rate than CP20, while chelating intracellular iron(III) at a similar rate, a finding consistent with an indirect inhibition of the tyrosyl radical. However, hepatocellular iron is mobilized at a faster rate by CP358 (P < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that it is possible to design bidentate HPOs which access intracellular iron pools rapidly while inhibiting non-heme iron-containing enzymes relatively slowly, at rates comparable to DFO.

This ESR peak intensity in DAp with collagen (c-DAp) decreased in an increase in the amount of collagen added into Ca(H2PO4)2H2O (MCP) electrolytic solution, because dangling H+ of HPO(4)2- binds to the carboxyl group of collagen due to the hydrogen bond.

Infrared (IR) micro-spectroscopy is well suited for this purpose. To date, IR microscopic (including imaging) analyses of bone apatite have centered on the nu(1),nu(3) PO(4)(3-) contour. The nu(4) PO(4)(3-) contour (500-650 cm(-1)), which has been extensively used to monitor the crystallinity of hydroxyapatite in homogenized bone samples, falls in a frequency region below the cutoff of the mercury-cadmium-telluride detectors used in commercial IR microscopes, thereby rendering this vibration inaccessible for imaging studies. The current study reports the first IR micro-spectroscopy spectra of human iliac crest cross sections in the nu(4) PO(4)(3-) spectral regions, obtained with a synchrotron radiation source and a Cu-doped Ge detector coupled to an IR microscope. The acid phosphate (HPO(4)(2-)) content and mineral crystallite perfection (crystallinity) of a human osteon were mapped. To develop spectra-structure correlations, a combination of X-ray powder diffraction data and conventional Fourier transform IR spectra have been obtained from a series of synthetic hydroxyapatite crystals and natural bone powders of various species and ages. X-ray powder diffraction data demonstrate that there is an increase in average crystal size as bone matures, which correlates with an increase in the nu(4) PO(4)(3-) FTIR absorption peak ratio of two peaks (603/563 cm(-1)) within the nu(4) PO(4)(3-) contour. Additionally, the IR results reveal that a band near 540 cm(-1) may be assigned to acid phosphate. This band is present at high concentrations in new bone, and decreases as bone matures. Correlation of the nu(4) PO(4)(3-) contour with the nu(2) CO (3)(2-) contour also reveals that when acid phosphate content is high, type A carbonate content (i.e., carbonate occupying OH(-) sites in the hydroxyapatite lattice) is high. As crystallinity increases and acid phosphate content decreases, carbonate substitution shifts toward occupation of PO(4)(3-) sites in the hydroxyapatite lattice. Thus, IR microscopic analysis of the nu(4) PO(4)(3-) contour provides a straightforward index of both relative mineral crystallinity and acid phosphate concentration that can be applied to in situ IR micro-spectroscopic analysis of bone samples, which are of interest for understanding the chemical mechanisms of bone deposition in normal and pathological states.","PMID":11420138,"authors":[{"lastName":"Miller","initials":"LM","foreName":"L M"},{"lastName":"Vairavamurthy","initials":"V","foreName":"V"},{"lastName":"Chance","initials":"MR","foreName":"M R"},{"lastName":"Mendelsohn","initials":"R","foreName":"R"},{"lastName":"Paschalis","initials":"EP","foreName":"E P"},{"lastName":"Betts","initials":"F","foreName":"F"},{"lastName":"Boskey","initials":"AL","foreName":"A L"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11494,"articleTitle":"Role of arginines in coenzyme A binding and catalysis by the phosphotransacetylase from Methanosarcina thermophila.","dateCreated":"2001-06-21","dateRevised":"2016-10-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9193","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of bacteriology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The role of arginine residues was investigated for the phosphotransacetylase from Methanosarcina thermophila. Kinetic analysis of a suite of variants indicated that Arg 87 and Arg 133 interact with the substrate CoA. Arg 87 variants were reduced in the ability to discriminate between CoA and the CoA analog 3'-dephospho-CoA, indicating that Arg 87 forms a salt bridge with the 3'-phosphate of CoA. Arg 133 is postulated to interact with the 5'-phosphate of CoA. Large decreases in k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) for all of the Arg 87 and Arg 133 variants indicated that these residues are also important, although not essential, for catalysis. Large decreases in k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) were also observed for the variants in which lysine replaced Arg 87 and Arg 133, suggesting that the bidentate interaction of these residues with CoA or their greater bulk is important for optimal activity.

Finally, apatite particulates were deposited on the surfaces of the collagen microsponges in the pores of PLGA sponge. The PLGA-collagen sponge served as a template for apatite deposition, and the deposition was accomplished by alternate immersion of PLGA-collagen sponge in CaCl(2) and Na(2)HPO(4) aqueous solutions and centrifugation. The deposited particulates were small and scarce after one cycle of alternate immersion. Their number and size increased with the number of alternate immersion cycles. The surfaces of collagen microsponges were completely covered with apatite after three cycles of alternate immersion. The porosity of the hybrid sponge decreased gradually as the number of alternate immersion increased. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis and X-ray diffraction spectra showed that the calcium-to-phosphorus molar ratio of the deposited particulates and the level of crystallinity increased with the number of alternate immersion cycles, and became almost the same as that of hydroxyapatite after four cycles of alternate immersion. The deposition process was controllable. Use of the PLGA sponge as a mechanical skeleton facilitated formation of the PLGA-collagen-apatite hybrid sponge into desired shapes and collagen microsponges facilitated the uniform deposition of apatite particulates throughout the sponge.

Plants were grown for 49 days in nutrient solutions treated with 1, 5 or 25 mmol P m(-3) Na(2)HPO(4) in a phytotron room. The increased formation of cluster roots occurred prior to a decrease in plant growth in response to P deficiency. The number of cluster roots was negatively correlated with tissue P concentrations below 2.0 g kg(-1) in shoots and 3 g kg(-1) in roots. Cluster roots generally had higher concentrations of Mg, Ca, N, Cu, Fe, and Mn but lower concentrations of K than non-cluster roots. Extrusion of protons and OA(-) (90% citrate and 10% malate) from roots was highly dependent on P supply. The amounts of H(+) extruded per unit root biomass decreased with time during the experiment. On the equimolar basis, H(+) extrusion by P-deficient plants (grown at 1 and 5 mmol P m(-3)) were, on average, 2-3-fold greater than OA(-) exudation. The excess cation content in plants was generally the highest at 1 mmol P m(-3) and decreased with increasing P supply. The ratio of H(+) release to excess cation uptake increased with decreasing P supply. The results suggest that increased exudation of OA(-) due to P deficiency is associated with H(+) extrusion but contributes only a part of total acidification.","PMID":11337076,"authors":[{"lastName":"Sas","initials":"L","foreName":"L"},{"lastName":"Rengel","initials":"Z","foreName":"Z"},{"lastName":"Tang","initials":"C","foreName":"C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11435,"articleTitle":"Optimization of fermentation conditions for preparation of polygalacturonic acid transeliminase by Erwinia carotovora IFO3830.","dateCreated":"2001-04-23","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"8756-7938","issnType":"Print","title":"Biotechnology progress","isoAbbreviation":"Biotechnol.

Because there is evidence suggesting possible detrimental effects on skeletal health associated with deficiencies in these hormones, a suitable means to asses ovarian hormone concentrations in at risk athletes is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate a simple, economical means to monitor the ovarian hormone production in athletes, in the setting of intensive training.Subjects comprised 14 adolescent rowers, 12 lightweight rowers, and two groups of 10 matched control subjects. Ovarian function was monitored during the competition season by estimation of urinary excretion of estrone glucuronide (E1G) and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), enabling the menstrual cycles to be classified as ovulatory or anovulatory.Results indicated 35% and 75% of schoolgirl and lightweight rowers had anovulatory menstrual cycles, respectively. These findings were highlighted by significantly lower excretion of E1G and PdG during phases of intensive training in both the lightweight and schoolgirl rowers, compared with the control subjects.It was concluded that the urinary E1G and PdG assays were an effective means to assess the influence of intense training on ovarian hormone concentrations in at risk athletes.

A 220l drum was filled with the AS at a temperature of about 180 degrees C. About 20h later the drum ignited and burned as it was being cooled. It is estimated that the AS contained approximately 55wt.% blown asphalt, 25wt.% NaNO(3), 5wt.% NaNO(2), 8wt.% Na(2)CO(3), 2wt.% NaH(2)PO(4), 1wt.% Ba (OH)(2), 1wt.% K(4)[Fe(CN)(6)], and possibly 3wt.% of other materials. To determine the reaction promoting factors and pertinent chemical reaction rates, self-reaction of the AS has been investigated by the use of a C80D heat flux reaction calorimeter. The oxidizing reactions with asphalt are ruled by NaNO(2) rather than by NaNO(3), in spite of a lower concentration of NaNO(2). The kinetic rates of the interfacial reaction between salt particles and asphalt for the reaction controlled and diffusion controlled steps have been formulated as a function of salt particle size for both NaNO(2) and NaNO(3). Numerical solution of the heat balance equations formulating the heterogeneous reaction scheme indicates that a runaway reaction occurs when the AS-filling temperature is 208 degrees C for a drum filled with an AS mixture produced under standard operating conditions. Molecules containing intramolecular hydrogen, such as Na(2)HPO(4) and NaHCO(3), do not oxidize asphalt directly, however, their presence chemically promotes the oxidizing reaction of NaNO(2). Moreover, NaHCO(3) decomposition which produces gases creates many micro holes in the interior of the salt particles. This in turn promotes the oxidizing reactions that are diffusion controlled. Finally, the consequence of a runaway reaction at 180 degrees C or lower is qualitatively explained by taking into account the chemical effect of intramolecular hydrogen and the physical effect of the NaHCO(3) decomposition gases.","PMID":11077162,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hasegawa","initials":"K","foreName":"K"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Y"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11309,"articleTitle":"Stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by hepatopoietin.","dateCreated":"2000-12-18","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9258","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of biological chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Recently, the identification of the mitogenic effect of HPO on hepatoma cell lines and the existence of HPO-specific receptors indicate that HPO acts via its specific cell surface receptor. However, the molecular mechanism of HPO action is not fully elucidated. In this report, we examined the signal transduction events induced by HPO in hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Our results demonstrated that HPO induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in a rapid and transient manner. HPO stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Furthermore, we observed that both MAPK activation and the mitogenic effect of HPO on HepG2 cells were completely blocked by AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. However, the effects of HPO were not antagonized by an EGFR-blocking antibody, mAb528, which blocks the interaction between epidermal growth factor and EGFR, indicating that stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by HPO was not mediated by epidermal growth factor. In contrast, genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in response to HPO. In conclusion, our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR may play a critical role in MAPK activation and mitogenic stimulation by HPO.","PMID":10982794,"authors":[{"lastName":"Li","initials":"Y","foreName":"Y"},{"lastName":"Li","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Xing","initials":"G","foreName":"G"},{"lastName":"Hu","initials":"Z","foreName":"Z"},{"lastName":"Wang","initials":"Q","foreName":"Q"},{"lastName":"Dong","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Wei","initials":"H","foreName":"H"},{"lastName":"Fan","initials":"G","foreName":"G"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"X","foreName":"X"},{"lastName":"Zhao","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"H","foreName":"H"},{"lastName":"Guan","initials":"K","foreName":"K"},{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"He","initials":"F","foreName":"F"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11208,"articleTitle":"The preparation and characterization of an immobilized l-glutamic decarboxylase and its application for determination of l-glutamic acid.","dateCreated":"2000-09-08","dateRevised":"2000-09-08","publication":{"issnNumber":"1879-0909","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Enzyme and microbial technology","isoAbbreviation":"Enzyme Microb.

The conditions for the enzyme immobilization were optimized by the parameters: buffer composition and concentration, adsorption equilibration time, amount of enzyme, temperature, ionic strength and pH. The dynamic response of Na(2)HPO(4)-citric acid buffer system selected is much better than that of the others, 0.10 M HAc-0.10 M NaAc and 0.10 M sodium citrate-0.10 M citric acid. The initial rate of the enzyme reaction v(0) in this buffer system is 1.76 mol. l(-1) min(-1), moreover, the rate of the enzyme reaction appears linear in the first 4 min. The optimum adsorption equilibrium time is around 6 h. The amount of enzyme adsorbed on CM-CADB resin affects the response to substrate L-glutamic acid, the widest range of linearity is obtained with over 30 mg (GDC)/g(resin). The GDC activity immobilized on CM-CADB reaches a maximum when the immobilization temperature was kept around 40 degrees C. pH was kept at 4.4 when measuring the activity of the immobilized GDC. No variation of the activity of immobilized GDC is observed when the capacity is over 2.5 meq/g.(CM-CADB resin). The properties of the immobilized enzyme on CM-CADB were characterized. No significant improvement can be achieved when the substrate concentration exceeds 12.00 mmol/l, where the activity of immobilized GDC is equal to 1.58 mmol/l.min.g. The optimum pH is found to be 5.2, which changes 0.2 unit, comparing with that of the free GDC (5.0). The optimum temperature is found to be around 48 degrees C, which is lower than that of free GDC (55 degrees C). The critical temperature of the free GDC and the immobilized GDC is approximately 50 degrees C and 45 degrees C, respectively.

Proton secretion across the luminal cell membrane is mediated by both H(+)-ATPase and H-K-ATPase, with fluxes through the H-K-ATPase given by a previously developed kinetic model (Weinstein AM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 274: F856-F867, 1998). The flux across each ATPase is substantial, and variation in abundance of either pump can be used to control OMCD proton secretion. In comparison with the H(+)-ATPase, flux through the H-K-ATPase is relatively insensitive to changes in lumen pH, so as luminal acidification proceeds, proton secretion shifts toward this pathway. Peritubular HCO(3)(-) exit is via a conductive pathway and via the Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger, AE1. To represent AE1, a kinetic model has been developed based on transport studies obtained at 38 degrees C in red blood cells. (Gasbjerg PK, Knauf PA, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 565-575, 1996; Knauf PA, Gasbjerg PK, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 577-589, 1996). Model calculations indicate that if all of the chloride entry via AE1 recycles across a peritubular chloride channel and if this channel is anything other than highly selective for chloride, then it should conduct a substantial fraction of the bicarbonate exit. Since both luminal membrane proton pumps are sensitive to small changes in cytosolic pH, variation in density of either AE1 or peritubular anion conductance can modulate OMCD proton secretory rate. With respect to the OMCD in situ, available buffer is predicted to be abundant, including delivered HCO(3)(-) and HPO(4)(2-), as well as peritubular NH(3). Thus, buffer availability is unlikely to exert a regulatory role in total proton secretion by this tubule segment.","PMID":10894785,"authors":[{"lastName":"Weinstein","initials":"AM","foreName":"A M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11198,"articleTitle":"Low temperature formation of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite-PLA/PLGA composites.","dateCreated":"2000-08-29","dateRevised":"2016-11-24","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9304","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of biomedical materials research","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Hydrolysis was performed at 56 degrees C-a temperature slightly above the glass transition of the polymers. The effects of polymer chemistry, composite formation technique, and porosity on hydrolysis kinetics and degree of transformation were examined with isothermal calorimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Calorimetric data and XRD analyses revealed that hydrolysis reactions were inhibited in the presence of the polymers. Isothermal calorimetry indicated the extent of the alpha-TCP to CDHAp transformation in 24 h to be 85% in the solvent cast composites containing PLGA (85:15) copolymer; however, XRD analyses suggested almost complete reaction. The CDHAp formation extent was 26% for the pressed composites containing the same polymer. In the presence of NaCl as a pore generator, 81% transformation was observed for the pressed composites. This transformation occurred without any chemical reaction between the polymer-inorganic components, as determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Minimal transformation to CDHAp occurred in composites containing poly(L-lactic) acid.","PMID":10880121,"authors":[{"lastName":"Durucan","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Brown","initials":"PW","foreName":"P W"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11172,"articleTitle":"Reperfusion injury is greater with delayed restoration of venous outflow in concurrent arterial and venous limb injury.","dateCreated":"2000-08-03","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0007-1323","issnType":"Print","title":"The British journal of surgery","isoAbbreviation":"Br J Surg"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Complex limb trauma often involves combined arterial and venous injury, and the resultant ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) causes both local and remote organ injury.

Increased bleeding may also occur, but it is rare. Hypothyroidism in girls can cause alterations in the pubertal process; this is usually a delay, but occasionally it can result in pseudo-precocious puberty.

Anovulation may be inferred from a number of observations but in the normal clinical situation, anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding, particularly in those at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have the polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is usually poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) oestrogen production there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used varies widely with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.The search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders Group was used to identify all randomised trials of progestogens alone or in combination with oestrogens in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with anovulation. In addition a search of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was undertaken.All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two reviewers. Both reviewers were experts in the content matter.No randomised trials were identified which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Only one small, non-randomised study compared two progestogen regimes in the management of heavy and irregular bleeding in subjects with confirmed anovulation. One randomised study compared the effects of two progestogens on endometrial histology in subjects with a variety of menstrual symptoms, half of whom had cystic glandular hyperplasia. No studies were found which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens in combination or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.

The purpose of this article is to critically review what is known about insomnia (perceived poor sleep) and physiologically assessed sleep, as well as sleep-related disordered breathing (SDB), in women according to menopausal status and the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) hormones. Self-report evidence that sleep difficulties are related to the hormonal changes of menopause is mixed. Data from studies in which sleep was physiologically measured reveal that sleep problems appear corequisite with hot flashes and sweats. Results are difficult to compare across studies because of varying methodologies in how sleep quality and patterns were assessed and how age cohorts and menopausal status were defined. The risk of SDB increases with age, although women are less susceptible at any age than men. As with men, snoring, obesity, and high blood pressure are clear risk factors. Some women may be underdiagnosed for SDB, as they have somewhat different symptom manifestations than men. Usually, frank apnea is not as evident. Primary care clinicians should be mindful of the potential for SDB in women who are obese, have high blood pressure, are cognizant of snoring, and report morning headaches and excessive daytime sleepiness. Improved care will result from consistently incorporating sleep insomnia assessments into practice as a basis for referring to sleep centers as necessary or prescribing sleep-enhancing behavioral and pharmacological treatments.","PMID":10746514,"authors":[{"lastName":"Shaver","initials":"JL","foreName":"J L"},{"lastName":"Zenk","initials":"SN","foreName":"S N"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11136,"articleTitle":"Investigations on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase/DNA binding interactions via molecular dynamics and electrostatics calculations.","dateCreated":"2000-06-28","dateRevised":"2008-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0163-7258","issnType":"Print","title":"Pharmacology & therapeutics","isoAbbreviation":"Pharmacol.

In contrast, the protein removal of the acid treated wastes was 76, 62, 56%, respectively.

The enzymatic activity appeared to be very unstable, but addition of Triton X100 and beta-mercaptoethanol to the buffer yielded an active enzyme that could be stored for several months at -80 degrees C. The enzyme was inhibited by desferoxamine mesylate (desferal), 2-methyl-1,2-di-3-pyridyl-1-propanone (metyrapone), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), n-propyl gallate and butylated hydroxyanisole, suggesting the involvement of free radicals in the reaction mechanism and the existence of a prosthetic group in the active center. However, no heme group could be demonstrated with the methods commonly used to identify heme groups in proteins. Only 13-hydroperoxides from linoleic acid (13-HPOD) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-13-HPOT) were cleaved by the tomato enzyme, with a clear preference for the latter substrate. The pH-optimum was 6.5, and for concentrations lower than 300 microM a typical Michaelis-Menten curve was found with a K(m) of 77 microM. At higher alpha-13-HPOT concentrations inhibition of the enzyme was observed, which could (at least in part) be attributed to 2E-hexenal. A curve of the substrate conversion as a function of the enzyme concentration revealed that 1 nkat of enzyme activity converts 0.7 mumol alpha-13-HPOT before inactivation. Headspace analysis showed that tomato HPO-lyase formed hexanal from 13-HPOD and 3Z-hexenal from alpha-13-HPOT. A trace of the latter compound was isomerized to 2E-hexenal. In addition to the aldehydes, 12-oxo-9Z-dodecenoic acid was found by GC/MS analysis.

In assumption of systemic phosphorus depletion, the presumed deficit commonly is replaced by oral phosphate supplements. However, such treatment is debatable, because intracellular phosphorus stores have not been assessed in this setting and may not be accurately reflected by serum phosphate concentrations. Moreover, disturbances in mineral metabolism from chronic renal failure, such as hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, may be prolonged with oral phosphate supplements. Conversely, a neutral phosphate salt might improve renal acid excretion and systemic acid/base homeostasis for its properties as a urinary buffer and a poorly reabsorbable anion. Twenty-eight patients with mild early posttransplantation hypophosphatemia (0.3-0.75 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to receive either neutral sodium phosphate (Na(2)HPO(4)) or sodium chloride (NaCl) for 12 weeks and examined with regard to (1) correction of serum phosphate concentration and urinary phosphate handling; (2) muscular phosphate content; (3) serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH); and, (4) renal acid handling and systemic acid/base homeostasis. Mean serum phosphate concentrations were similar and normal in both groups after 12 weeks of treatment; however, more patients in the NaCl group remained hypophosphatemic (93% versus 67%). Total muscular phosphorus content did not correlate with serum phosphate concentrations and was 25% below normophosphatemic controls but was completely restored after 12 weeks with and without phosphate supplementation. However, the percentage of the energy-rich phosphorus compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was significantly higher in the Na(2)HPO(4) group, as was the relative content of phosphodiesters. Also, compensated metabolic acidosis (hypobicarbonatemia with respiratory stimulation) was detected in most patients, which was significantly improved by neutral phosphate supplements through increased urinary titratable acidity. These benefits of added phosphate intake were not associated with any adverse effects on serum calcium and PTH concentrations. In conclusion, oral supplementation with a neutral phosphate salt effectively corrects posttransplantation hypophosphatemia, increases muscular ATP and phosphodiester content without affecting mineral metabolism, and improves renal acid excretion and systemic acid/base status.","PMID":10561144,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ambühl","initials":"PM","foreName":"P M"},{"lastName":"Meier","initials":"D","foreName":"D"},{"lastName":"Wolf","initials":"B","foreName":"B"},{"lastName":"Dydak","initials":"U","foreName":"U"},{"lastName":"Boesiger","initials":"P","foreName":"P"},{"lastName":"Binswanger","initials":"U","foreName":"U"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10952,"articleTitle":"A multi-step lipid mixing assay to model structural changes in cationic lipoplexes used for in vitro transfection.","dateCreated":"1999-12-27","dateRevised":"2016-11-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"0006-3002","issnType":"Print","title":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","isoAbbreviation":"Biochim.

To clarify the apparent lack of correlation between membrane fusion and in vitro transfection previously observed, we performed a multi-step lipid mixing assay to model the sequential steps involved in transfection. The roles of anion charge density, charge ratio and presence of salt on lipid mixing and liposome aggregation were investigated. The resonance-energy transfer method was used to monitor lipid mixing as cationic liposomes (DODAC/DOPE and DODAC/DOPC; 1:1 mole ratio) were combined with plasmid, oligonucleotides or Na(2)HPO(4). Cryo-transmission electron microscopy was performed to assess morphology. As plasmid or oligonucleotide concentration increased, lipid mixing and aggregation increased, but with Na(2)HPO(4) only aggregation occurred. NaCl (150 mM) reduced the extent of lipid mixing. Transfection studies suggest that the presence of salt during complexation had minimal effects on in vitro transfection. These data give new information about the effects of polynucleotide binding to cationic liposomes, illustrating the complicated nature of anion induced changes in liposome morphology and membrane behavior.","PMID":10556486,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wasan","initials":"EK","foreName":"E K"},{"lastName":"Harvie","initials":"P","foreName":"P"},{"lastName":"Edwards","initials":"K","foreName":"K"},{"lastName":"Karlsson","initials":"G","foreName":"G"},{"lastName":"Bally","initials":"MB","foreName":"M B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10941,"articleTitle":"Sequencing of peptides phosphorylated on serines and threonines by post-source decay in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","dateCreated":"1999-12-16","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"1076-5174","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS","isoAbbreviation":"J Mass Spectrom"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In the era of complete genome sequences, biochemical and medical research will focus more on the dynamic proteome of a cell. Regulation of proteins by post-translational modifications, which are not determined by the gene sequence, are already intensively studied.

In this paper we describe the sequencing of mono- and bisphosphorylated peptides, including identification of the phosphorylation sites, by post-source decay (PSD) in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In addition to dephosphorylation of the parent ions, we studied the influence of the phosphate group on the fragmentation of peptides. Generally, peptides phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues displayed no difference in their fragmentation patterns. The intensities of the resulting fragment ion signals depend only on the peptide sequence and not on either the phosphorylated amino acid or its position in the peptide chain. Phosphorylation increased the bond cleavage C-terminal to the phosphorylation site more than 10-fold, resulting in abundant signals, which typically dominated the PSD spectra. The produced C-terminally phosphorylated b-type fragment ions showed characteristic dephosphorylated fragment ions b(n) -H(3)PO(4) (-98 Da) and b(n) -HPO(3) (-80 Da) of higher abundances than the phosphorylated fragment ion. As a second layer to identify the phosphorylation site, all internally phosphorylated fragment ions were accompanied by minor, but always detectable, signals of the dephosphorylated fragment ions.

This demonstrates that seven-pass transmembrane receptors can signal via members of the STE20 kinase family in higher eukaryotes.

The present study investigated the effect of ovarian steroids on CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the rhesus monkey hypothalamus, as both neuropeptides have been shown to stimulate the HPA axis and inhibit the HPO axis in this species. This was accomplished by measuring CRH and AVP mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Menstrual cycles were simulated in ovariectomized (OVX) rhesus monkeys by sequential addition and removal of SILASTIC brand (Dow Corning Corp.) tubing containing either 17beta-estradiol (E2) or progesterone (P4). On the morning of day 11 of the simulated follicular phase (E2 alone) or day 21 of the luteal phase (E2 + P4), animals were anesthetized, and the brains were perfused with paraformaldehyde via the carotid artery. Coronal sections (30 microm) were cut, and mRNA for CRH and AVP in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) were semiquantified by in situ hybridization. CRH mRNA in the PVN of E2-replaced OVX animals (n = 7) was 2-fold greater than that in untreated OVX controls (n = 4), whereas CRH mRNA after E2 + P4 (n = 4) was no different from that in controls (optical density + SEM, 0.38 +/- 0.06, 0.13 +/- 0.08, and 0.14 +/- 0.09 for OVX + E2, OVX + E2 + P4, and OVX, respectively; P = 0.02). CRH in the SON was undetectable. In contrast to CRH, AVP mRNA in the PVN and the SON was similar in the three treatment groups. We conclude that E2 and E2 + P4 replacement to OVX monkeys exert different effects on CRH and AVP gene expression, as estrogen stimulation of CRH mRNA in the PVN was abrogated by progesterone, whereas no effect of ovarian steroids on AVP mRNA in either the PVN or SON was observed. We postulate that ovarian steroid regulation of CRH synthesis and release may in part explain the central nervous system mechanisms by which ovarian steroids affect the HPA and HPO axes during basal and stress conditions.","PMID":10218971,"authors":[{"lastName":"Roy","initials":"BN","foreName":"B N"},{"lastName":"Reid","initials":"RL","foreName":"R L"},{"lastName":"Van Vugt","initials":"DA","foreName":"D A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10731,"articleTitle":"Identification and characterization of receptor for mammalian hepatopoietin that is homologous to yeast ERV1.","dateCreated":"1999-05-20","dateRevised":"2009-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9258","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of biological chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"J.

In contrast to Pak family members, SPS1 family members do not bind and are not activated by GTP-bound p21Rac and Cdc42. We recently placed a member of the SPS1 family, called Misshapen (Msn), genetically upstream of the c-Jun amino-terminal (JNK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase module in Drosophila [4]. The failure to activate JNK in Drosophila leads to embryonic lethality due to the failure of these embryos to stimulate dorsal closure [5-8]. Msn probably functions as a MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase in Drosophila, activating the JNK pathway via an, as yet, undefined MAP kinase kinase kinase. We have identified a Drosophila TNF-receptor-associated factor, DTRAF1, by screening for Msn-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. In contrast to the mammalian TRAFs that have been shown to activate JNK, DTRAF1 lacks an amino-terminal 'Ring-finger' domain, and overexpression of a truncated DTRAF1, consisting of only its TRAF domain, activates JNK. We also identified another DTRAF, DTRAF2, that contains an amino-terminal Ring-finger domain. Msn specifically binds the TRAF domain of DTRAF1 but not that of DTRAF2. In Drosophila, DTRAF1 is thus a good candidate for an upstream molecule that regulates the JNK pathway by interacting with, and activating, Msn. Consistent with this idea, expression of a dominant-negative Msn mutant protein blocks the activation of JNK by DTRAF1. Furthermore, coexpression of Msn with DTRAF1 leads to the synergistic activation of JNK. We have extended some of these observations to the mammalian homolog of Msn, Nck-interacting kinase (NIK), suggesting that TRAFs also play a critical role in regulating Ste20 kinases in mammals.","PMID":10021364,"authors":[{"lastName":"Liu","initials":"H","foreName":"H"},{"lastName":"Su","initials":"YC","foreName":"Y C"},{"lastName":"Becker","initials":"E","foreName":"E"},{"lastName":"Treisman","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Skolnik","initials":"EY","foreName":"E Y"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10654,"articleTitle":"The purification and characterization of fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase in sunflower.","dateCreated":"1999-03-04","dateRevised":"2016-11-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"0006-3002","issnType":"Print","title":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","isoAbbreviation":"Biochim.

Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) causes loss of the dialytic function. Several studies have indicated that PF is closely related to the proliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) plays a major role in stimulating extracellular matrix deposition. Frequent peritonitis occurrence may cause persistent TGF-beta1 mRNA expression. In an attempt to search for a factor related to PF, we designed a longitudinal study to measure TGF-beta1 levels in dialysate and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in peritoneal mononuclear cells from peritoneal dialysate before onset, once a week during peritonitis, and after peritonitis in high and low peritonitis occurrence (HPO and LPO) patients. Fifteen patients with a LPO rate and 5 patients with a HPO rate were followed up longitudinally. Meanwhile, TGF-beta1 levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression were augmented in peritoneal dialysate effluents before, during, and after the episodes of peritonitis. The peritoneal permeability was evaluated by the peritoneal equilibration test. The results revealed that in the LPO group, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta1 mRNA were detectable at early stages of peritonitis, but the levels decreased rapidly and were undetectable 2 weeks after peritonitis. On the other hand, in the HPO group, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta1 mRNA persisted for a long time. We could detect TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta1 mRNA in dialysate effluents and peritoneal mononuclear cells even 2, 3, and 4 weeks after episodes of peritonitis. When compared with that of first or second episode of peritonitis, the peritoneal function evaluated with the peritoneal equilibration test was found to obviously deteriorate during the third episode of peritonitis. These findings were confirmed by an in situ hybridization technique to evaluate the relationship between TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and PF from biopsied peritoneal specimens. These findings suggest that the high TGF-beta1 levels in the dialysate are related to an increased expression of TGF-beta1 in the peritoneum. Thus, the persistent TGF-beta1 expression in the peritoneum may serve as a useful parameter in predicting PF in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients with frequent peritonitis occurrence.","PMID":9845827,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"CY","foreName":"C Y"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"WP","foreName":"W P"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"LY","foreName":"L Y"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"A","foreName":"A"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"TP","foreName":"T P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10550,"articleTitle":"[Mortality of children with sickle cell disease in a pediatric department in Central Africa].","dateCreated":"1998-11-20","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0929-693X","issnType":"Print","title":"Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie","isoAbbreviation":"Arch Pediatr"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"fre","articleAbstract":"Sickle cell disease is a serious public health problem in Gabon with a relatively high mortality rate.Charts of 23 children (nine boys, 14 girls) who died of complications from sickle cell anemia in the department of pediatrics of Owendo Pediatric Hospital (Libreville, Gabon), from January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1992, were analysed retrospectively.Approximately two-thirds of the children (60.9%) were under 5 years of age.

Relative body fat (%), fat-weight (FW), and fat-free weight (FFW) were assessed using BI and HW under normal conditions (N), hypohydration (HPO), rehydration (RHY), and superhydration (SHY) states. During the RHY and SHY trial periods, subjects were hydrated with either distilled water or an electrolyte solution (ELS). HPO and SHY levels were set at 3% of each person's normally hydrated body weight.Comparison between the distilled water and the ELS trials indicated that hydration solution had no effect on BI or HW. Thus, the results presented are the trial means of both hydration solutions combined. Both BI and HW were shown to be highly test-retest reliable (r-values: 0.96 and 0.99, respectively). The effects of exercise induced HPO followed by RHY on body composition values indicated that HW was very stable across measurement periods while BI was not. From N to the HPO state, BI %BF declined from 14.4 +/- 5.3% to 12.3 +/- 5.3%, respectively. After RHY, BIA %BF increased to 15.5 +/- 5.8%.

With a comparison of the intercepts and slopes of HW and BIA for the N and SHY states, it was clear hydration status significantly affected the intercepts (HW: 0.37 vs. BI: 1.85) and not the slopes (HW: 1.00 vs BI: 0.99). As a result, a majority of all fluid changes were interpreted as FW by BI. During HPO, 82% of the weight loss was considered FW while during RHY or SHY, 128% and 85% of the water weight regain/gain was considered FW.These results indicate that BI is not a valid technique in athletes, especially when wanting to determine body composition effects of training/detraining.

To test the hypothesis that fluctuations in plasma leptin concentrations are related to the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol, we sampled plasma from six healthy women every 7 min for 24 h during days 8-11 of the menstrual cycle. Cross-correlation analysis throughout the 24-h cycle revealed a relation between release patterns of leptin and LH, with a lag of 42-84 min but no significant cross-correlation between LH and estradiol. The ultradian fluctuations in leptin levels showed pattern synchrony with those of both LH and estradiol as determined by cross-approximate entropy (cross-ApEn). At night, as leptin levels rose to their peak, the pulsatility profiles of LH changed significantly and became synchronous with those of leptin. LH pulses were fewer, of longer duration, higher amplitude, and larger area than during the day. Moreover, the synchronicity of LH and leptin occurred late at night, at which time estradiol and leptin also exhibited significantly stronger pattern coupling than during the day. We propose that leptin may regulate the minute-to-minute oscillations in the levels of LH and estradiol, and that the nocturnal rise in leptin may determine the change in nocturnal LH profile in the mid-to-late follicular phase that precedes ovulation. This may explain the disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function that is characteristic of states of low leptin release, such as anorexia nervosa and cachexia.","PMID":9482922,"authors":[{"lastName":"Licinio","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Negrão","initials":"AB","foreName":"A B"},{"lastName":"Mantzoros","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Kaklamani","initials":"V","foreName":"V"},{"lastName":"Wong","initials":"ML","foreName":"M L"},{"lastName":"Bongiorno","initials":"PB","foreName":"P B"},{"lastName":"Mulla","initials":"A","foreName":"A"},{"lastName":"Cearnal","initials":"L","foreName":"L"},{"lastName":"Veldhuis","initials":"JD","foreName":"J D"},{"lastName":"Flier","initials":"JS","foreName":"J S"},{"lastName":"McCann","initials":"SM","foreName":"S M"},{"lastName":"Gold","initials":"PW","foreName":"P W"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10239,"articleTitle":"Effect(s) of the demineralization process on the osteoinductivity of demineralized bone matrix.","dateCreated":"1998-01-13","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0022-3492","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of periodontology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The present study was directed at establishing in vivo and in vitro models for a quantitative assessment of the osteoinductivity of DBM before clinical use. Athymic mice were used in an in vivo assay to overcome the species limitations (for human DBM) found in xenogeneic animal models. Calcium contents of explants, as an indicator of new bone formation, were assayed and expressed as a change in the weight percent calcium in the explant as compared to the weight percent of calcium in the implanted material. A total of 82 mice (2 implants per mouse) were used in this study. Significant amounts of new bone were induced in this animal model in response to implantation of DBM. Muscular implantation was found to be more osteoinductive (increases of 10.0 +/- 0.4 calcium weight percent of explant) than subcutaneous implantation (increases of 1.62 +/- 0.27 calcium weight percent of explant) and new bone formation in muscular implantation sites of athymic mice mimics endochondral bone formation. Between weeks 1 to 4, the weight of explanted materials did not significantly differ from the weight of the implanted material; however, by week 5 the explant weight began to increase. Calcium deposition over the 5 weeks of implantation increased in a nearly linear fashion. Consequently week 4 was chosen as the optimum time for explantation in the in vivo assay in that sufficient calcium levels had been achieved without a significant increase in explant dry weight. Aliquots of 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg per implantation site were used in dose response studies in the in vivo bioassay. Dose response curves with DBM exhibited maximal activity at the 20 mg DBM implant dose in the in vivo bioassay. An in vitro bioassay was also developed where human periosteal (HPO) cells were chosen because osteoprogenitor cells found in bone repair typically come from periosteal tissue. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in confluent cell cultures of HPO cells exposed to DBM, as an indicator of osteoblast induction, reached its highest level on day 5 of DBM treatment. Aliquots of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg DBM per flask were chosen in dose response studies using the in vitro bioassay. These dose response studies with DBM revealed that quantities approximating 5 to 10 mg DBM in the in vitro model provided for maximal levels of ALP in cell extracts. A linear correlation (R2 = 0.7397) was demonstrated between the in vivo calcium remineralization assay and the in vitro ALP assay of osteoinductivity of DBM, suggesting that the in vitro assay can be used to quantitatively assess the osteoinductive potential of DBM where production and distribution of clinically usable DBM dictates rapid analysis.","PMID":9407400,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zhang","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Powers","initials":"RM","foreName":"R M"},{"lastName":"Wolfinbarger","initials":"L","foreName":"L"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":10241,"articleTitle":"Clinical evaluation of a silicone coated hollow fiber oxygenator.","dateCreated":"1998-01-15","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"1058-2916","issnType":"Print","title":"ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)","isoAbbreviation":"ASAIO J."},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In this article, the clinical experience with a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using a newly developed hollow fiber oxygenator with an ultra-thin layer of silicone is reported.

In about 95% of cases it is caused by the late maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO), leading to anovulatory cycles. These adolescents lack the E2 positive feedback on LH. Thus, the continuous production of estrogen with endometrial stimulation is the basic cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The initial step in the evaluation of DUB includes detailed clinical history, followed by complete physical examination. Laboratory tests should include coagulation profile, complete blood count with platelet evaluation, and sometimes a serum pregnancy test. The treatment of DUB is related to the severity of symptomatology with the objective of stopping bleeding and preventing recurrences. Modern hormonal and other medical therapies enable physicians to treat DUB effectively, regardless of the cause. Surgical treatment, such as dilatation and curettage, is rarely indicated in the adolescent patient. The importance of continued follow-up in DUB cases should be underlined, until stabilization of ovulatory menstrual cycles.","PMID":9238265,"authors":[{"lastName":"Deligeoroglou","initials":"E","foreName":"E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11618,"articleTitle":"Hydrothermal Synthesis, Structure, and Magnetic Properties of a Novel Monodimensional Iron Phosphate: [FeF(HPO(4))(2),N(2)C(3)H(12),(H(2)O)(x)()] (x approximately 0.20) (ULM-14).","dateCreated":"2001-10-23","dateRevised":"2001-10-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-510X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"ULM-14 or [FeF(HPO(4))(2),N(2)C(3)H(12),(H(2)O)(x)()] (x approximately 0.20) was synthesized by the hydrothermal method (24 h, 453 K) under autogenous pressure.

A conventional membrane oxygenator (Mera Excelung HPO-15H, MERA, Tokyo) was used in five goats as a control (C-NC group), and a new silicone coated membrane oxygenator, which is the exact same construction of C-NC group, in five (C-SC group). In the both groups, the same roller pump and circuit were used. The pump flow was 64.9 +/- 5.1 ml/kg in C-NC group, and 65.7 +/- 3.1 ml/kg in C-SC group.

Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) causes the loss of dialytic function. Several studies have indicated that PF is closely related to the proliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) plays a major role in stimulating ECM deposition. Frequent peritonitis occurrence may cause persistent TGF beta 1 mRNA expression. In an attempt to search for a factor related to PF, we designed a longitudinal study to measure TGF beta 1 levels in dialysate and TGF beta 1 mRNA expression in peritoneal mononuclear cells (PMNCs) from peritoneal dialysate before, at the onset of and once a week during peritonitis and after peritonitis in patients with high peritonitis occurrence (HPO) and patients with low peritonitis occurrence (LPO). Fifteen patients with a LPO rate and 5 patients with a HPO rate were followed up longitudinally. Meanwhile, TGF beta 1 levels and TGF beta 1 mRNA expression were augmented in peritoneal dialytic fluid before, during, and after the episodes of peritonitis. Peritoneal permeability was evaluated by the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The results revealed that in the LPO group, TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA were detectable at early stages of peritonitis, but the levels decreased rapidly and were undetectable 2 weeks after peritonitis. On the other hand, in the HPO group, TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA persisted for a long time. We could detect TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA in dialytic fluid and PMNCs even 2, 3, and 4 weeks after episodes of peritonitis. When compared with that of the first or second episode of peritonitis, peritoneal function evaluated with the PET was found to obviously deteriorate at the third episode of peritonitis. These findings were confirmed by an in situ hybridization technique to evaluate the relationship between TGF beta 1 mRNA expression and PF from biopsied peritoneal specimens. These findings suggest that the high TGF beta 1 levels in the dialysate are related to an increased expression of TGF beta 1 in the peritoneum. Persistent TGF beta 1 expression in the peritoneum may serve as a useful parameter in predicting PF in CAPD patients with frequent peritonitis occurrence.","PMID":9360653,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"CY","foreName":"C Y"},{"lastName":"Chen","initials":"WP","foreName":"W P"},{"lastName":"Fu","initials":"LW","foreName":"L W"},{"lastName":"Yang","initials":"LY","foreName":"L Y"},{"lastName":"Huang","initials":"TP","foreName":"T P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":9938,"articleTitle":"Changes of lipoxygenase and fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase activities in bell pepper fruits during maturation.","dateCreated":"1997-03-18","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0916-8451","issnType":"Print","title":"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Biosci.

To overcome this problem, the stability constant logarithms of the 1:1 Al(III) complexes of ligands with the same donor groups (log K(1:1)) were plotted against the basicities of the ligands (log K(PO)3(H)). The resulting linear free energy relation (LFER) indicates that organic phosphates, phosphonates, and uridine-, thymidine-, and guanosine 5'-monophosphates similarly bind Al(III). Adenosine and cytidine 5'-monophosphate fall above the LFER owing to the presence of a second microform with the nucleic base protonated and a hydroxide bound to the Al(III).

Overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased ACTH secretion appear to be important mechanisms resulting in steroid excess in untreated patients, at least in the classic forms of the disorder. Nonetheless, most NCAH patients do not demonstrate overactivity of the HPA axis. A few of these patients may demonstrate a mild degree of ACTH hyper-responsiveness to corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation, and up to 40% have radiologic evidence of adrenocortical hyperplasia and/or isolated adenomas, suggesting that some degree of chronic ACTH excess is present. Another mechanism resulting in adrenocortical excess in adrenal hyperplasia, and primarily in NCAH, follows the alteration in enzyme kinetics resulting from the mutation of 21-OH. The mutated enzyme product is less efficient than the wild type, resulting in an increased precursor to product ratio, independent of ACTH levels. Hence, progesterone (P4) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-HP) levels in these patients may remain above normal even in the presence of excess glucocorticoid administration. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system may also be important in stimulating adrenocortical steroidogenesis in patients with salt-wasting and in some with simple virilizing CAH. Alterations in ovarian and gonadotropic function, with the appearance of a polycystic ovary-like picture, also contribute to the androgen excess of these patients. Functional ovarian abnormalities in patients with CAH or NCAH may relate to a number of causes, including prenatal masculinization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis by adrenal androgens, continued disruption of the HPO axis by persistently elevated P4 or androgen levels, and/or a direct glucocorticoid effect. Finally, these data suggest that the measurement of P4 or 17-HP may not be the most accurate marker of therapeutic efficacy, and suppression of both the ovaries and adrenals may be necessary for optimum steroidogenic control.","PMID":8923412,"authors":[{"lastName":"Azziz","initials":"R","foreName":"R"},{"lastName":"Slayden","initials":"SM","foreName":"S M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11617,"articleTitle":"Hydrothermal Synthesis, Structure, and Solid State (19)F NMR Study of ULM-17: (H(3)O)(2)[V(4)(HPO(4))(PO(4))(3)O(6)F](2)[NC(7)H(14)](6).","dateCreated":"2001-10-22","dateRevised":"2001-10-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"1520-510X","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Inorganic chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Inorg Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"(H(3)O)(2)[V(4)(HPO(4))(PO(4))(3)O(6)F](2)[NC(7)H(14)](6) (labeled ULM-17) has been hydrothermally synthesized (150 degrees, 24 h, autogeneous pressure).

In parallel, protein charge neutralization resulting from specific anion binding allows monitoring for surface-charge/E(o) relationships. This approach shows that a number of anions, most of which are of biological relevance, namely CI-, HPO(2-)4, HCO3-, NO3, SO(2-)4, CIO4-, citrate3- and oxalate2-, bind specifically to the protein surface, often in a sequential manner as a result of the presence of multiple sites with different affinities. The binding stoichiometries of the various anions toward a given cytochrome are in general different. Chloride and phosphate appear to bind to a greater extent to both proteins as compared to the other anions. Differences in binding specificity toward the two cytochromes, although highly sequence-related, are observed for a few anions. The data are discussed comparatively in terms of electrostatic and geometric properties of the anions and by reference to the proposed location and amino acid composition of the anion binding sites, when available. Specific binding of this large set of anions bearing different charges allows the electrostatic effect on Eo due to neutralization of net positive protein surface charge(s) to be monitored. (J)H NMR indeed indicates the absence of significant salt-induced structural perturbations, hence the above change in Eo is predominantly electrostatic in origin. A systematic study of protein surface-charge/Eo relationships using this approach is unprecedented. Values of 15-25 mV (extrapolated at zero ionic strength) are obtained for the decrease in Eo due to neutralization of one positive surface charge, which are of the same order of magnitude as previous estimates obtained with either mutation or chemical modification of surface lysines. The effects of the anion-induced decrease of net positive charge on Eo persist also at a relatively high ionic strength and add to the general effects related to the charge shielding of the protein as a whole due to the surrounding ionic atmosphere: hence the ionic strength dependence of the rate of electron transfer between cytochromes c and redox partners could also involve salt-induced changes in the driving force.","PMID":8898908,"authors":[{"lastName":"Battistuzzi","initials":"G","foreName":"G"},{"lastName":"Borsari","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Dallari","initials":"D","foreName":"D"},{"lastName":"Lancellotti","initials":"I","foreName":"I"},{"lastName":"Sola","initials":"M","foreName":"M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":11617,"articleTitle":"Synthetic Strategies To Obtain V-P-O Open Frameworks Containing Organic Species as Structural Directing Agents.

A stroboscopic lighting imaging technique was developed to capture cavitation bubbles on the MHV inflow surfaces at selected time delays ranging from 25 microseconds to 1 ms after the leaflet/housing impact. The TP traces measured 10 mm away from the valve leaflet tip showed a large pressure reduction peak at the leaflet/housing impact, and subsequent high frequency pressure oscillations (HPOs) while the cavitation bubbles were observed. The occurrence of cavitation bubbles and HPO bursts were found to be random on a beat by beat basis. However, the amplitude of the TP reduction, the intensity of the cavitation bubble (size and number), and the intensity of HPO were found to increase with the test heart rate. A correlation between the MHV cavitation bubbles and the HPO burst was positively established. Power spectrum analysis of the TP signals further showed that the frequency of the HPO (cavitation bubble collapse pressures) ranged from 100 to 450 kHz.","PMID":8944941,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"ZJ","foreName":"Z J"},{"lastName":"Slonin","initials":"JH","foreName":"J H"},{"lastName":"Hwang","initials":"NH","foreName":"N H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":12506,"articleTitle":"Determination of selenite, selenate and selenomethionine by ion chromatography, microwave digestion and HGAAS.","dateCreated":"2004-03-29","dateRevised":"2004-03-29","publication":{"issnNumber":"1618-2650","issnType":"Electronic","title":"Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry","isoAbbreviation":"Anal Bioanal Chem"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"An on-line system for the simultaneous determination of Se(IV), Se(VI) and selenomethionine (Se-Met) in aqueous samples was developed, consisting of separation by ion chromatography, microwave digestion and detection by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. 8.3 mmol/l Na(2)HPO(4) (pH 9.2) was used as mobile phase for the ion chromatography, with a flow-rate of 1.5 ml/min.

From the calculations, the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied metal-based levels are delta(Pt(2)) and sigma(Pt(2)), respectively, indicating a metal-metal single bond analogous to the isoelectronic Rh(II) complex. The energetic ordering of the main metal-metal bonding levels is, however, quite different from that found for the Rh(II) complex, and the upper metal-metal bonding and antibonding levels have significantly more ligand character. As found for the related complex [W(2)(O(2)CH)(4)], the inclusion of relativistic effects leads to a further strengthening of the metal-metal sigma bond as a result of the increased involvement of the higher-lying platinum 6s orbital. The low-temperature absorption spectrum of [Pt(2)(O(2)CCH(3))(4)(H(2)O)(2)](2+) is assigned on the basis of Xalpha-SW calculated transition energies and oscillator strengths. Unlike the analogous Rh(II) spectrum, the visible and near-UV absorption spectrum is dominated by charge transfer (CT) transitions. The weak, visible bands at 27 500 and 31 500 cm(-)(1) are assigned to Ow --> sigma(Pt(2)) and OAc --> sigma(Pt(2)) CT transitions, respectively, although the donor orbital in the latter transition has around 25% pi(Pt(2)) character. The intense near-UV band around 37 500 cm(-)(1) displays the typical lower energy shift as the axial substituents are changed from H(2)O to Cl and Br, indicative of significant charge transfer character. From the calculated oscillator strengths, a number of transitions, mostly OAc --> sigma(Pt-O) CT in nature, are predicted to contribute to this band, including the metal-based sigma(Pt(2)) --> sigma(Pt(2)) transition. The close similarity in the absorption spectra of the CH(3)COO(-), SO(4)(2)(-), and HPO(4)(2)(-) bridged Pt(III) complexes suggests that analogous spectral assignments should apply to [Pt(2)(SO(4))(4)(H(2)O)(2)](2)(-) and [Pt(2)(HPO(4))(4)(H(2)O)(2)](2)(-). Consequently, the anomalous MCD spectra reported recently for the intense near-UV band in the SO(4)(2)(-) and HPO(4)(2)(-) bridged Pt(III) complexes can be rationalized on the basis of contributions from either SO(4) --> sigma(Pt-O) or HPO(4) --> sigma(Pt-O) CT transitions. The electronic absorption spectrum of [Rh(2)(O(2)CCH(3))(4)(H(2)O)(2)] has been re-examined on the basis of Xalpha-SW calculated transition energies and oscillator strengths. The intense UV band at approximately 45 000 cm(-)(1) is predicted to arise from several excitations, both metal-centered and CT in origin. The lower energy shoulder at approximately 40 000 cm(-)(1) is largely attributed to the metal-based sigma(Rh(2)) --> sigma(Rh(2)) transition.","PMID":11666423,"authors":[{"lastName":"Stranger","initials":"R","foreName":"Robert"},{"lastName":"Medley","initials":"GA","foreName":"Gregory A."},{"lastName":"McGrady","initials":"JE","foreName":"John E."},{"lastName":"Garrett","initials":"JM","foreName":"Jodie M."},{"lastName":"Appleton","initials":"TG","foreName":"Trevor G."}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14785,"articleTitle":"Production of Galacto-Oligosaccharide from Lactose by Sterigmatomyces elviae CBS8119.","dateCreated":"2010-06-25","dateRevised":"2010-06-25","publication":{"issnNumber":"0099-2240","issnType":"Print","title":"Applied and environmental microbiology","isoAbbreviation":"Appl.

The present study demonstrated that the lipophilicity in the molecule is playing an important role for the inhibition of NNK metabolism with pulmonary and hepatic microsomes of A/J mice.","PMID":7497457,"authors":[{"lastName":"Desai","initials":"D","foreName":"D"},{"lastName":"Nunes","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Chang","initials":"L","foreName":"L"},{"lastName":"Lin","initials":"JM","foreName":"J M"},{"lastName":"Jiao","initials":"D","foreName":"D"},{"lastName":"Amin","initials":"S","foreName":"S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":9573,"articleTitle":"Transient pressure at closing of a monoleaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis: mounting compliance effect.","dateCreated":"1996-03-18","dateRevised":"2014-11-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"0966-8519","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of heart valve disease","isoAbbreviation":"J.

The closing velocity and the transient pressure were simultaneously measured at heart rates of 70, 90, 120, and 140 beats/minute with cardiac outputs of 5.0, 6.0, 7.5, and 8.5 liters/minute, respectively. The experiment was conducted under simulated physiologic ventricular and aortic pressures in a pulsatile mock flow loop. The characteristics of the transient pressure were investigated by detailed mapping of the transient pressure field in the atrial chamber using high frequency pressure transducers. Simultaneous measurements of the occluder closing velocity and the transient pressure around the seat stop of the MH showed that the transient pressure generated on the inflow side dropped below the vapor pressure of liquid during the occluder's sudden deceleration at closing. The amplitude of the transient pressure reduction (TR) was proportional to the occluder approaching velocity. The development of the transient pressure in the rigid and flexible mountings were significantly different. In the rigid mounting (RM), the pressure was reduced below the liquid's vapor pressure and maintained below -350 mmHg for approximately 180 microseconds. Strong signals of high frequency pressure oscillations (HPO) were recorded in the transient pressure traces. The timing of the HPO was found to be consistent with that of the cavitation bubble collapse as observed by others. In the flexible mounting (FM), TR also occurred, but recovered quickly and was followed immediately by a positive pressure spike. Relatively weak HPO appeared in the transient pressure trace. The mapping of the transient pressure field showed that both the transient pressure reduction (on the major orifice side) or rise (on the minor orifice side) as well as the HPO were locally generated near the valve occluder surface. The transient pressure attenuated with distance away from the occluder surface. The HPO were detectable as far as 40 mm away from the occluder surface. The rigid mounting pressure signals showed characteristically two occurrences of high frequency pressure oscillations. The HPO with smaller amplitude occurred first after the initiation of the TR, followed by a burst of strong HPO at about 450 microseconds. It is believed that they were the result of the collapse of cavitation bubbles. The strong HPO did not appear in the flexible mounting signals. The study indicated that the mounting compliance played a significant role in the MHV cavitation inception and the subsequent bubble growth. It also suggested the possibility of detecting the cavitation by using a high frequency pressure transducer positioned in the atrial chamber.","PMID":8581200,"authors":[{"lastName":"Wu","initials":"ZJ","foreName":"Z J"},{"lastName":"Gao","initials":"BZ","foreName":"B Z"},{"lastName":"Hwang","initials":"NH","foreName":"N H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":9491,"articleTitle":"Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an early sign of pulmonary metastasis.","dateCreated":"1995-12-27","dateRevised":"2016-11-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"0143-3636","issnType":"Print","title":"Nuclear medicine communications","isoAbbreviation":"Nucl Med Commun"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and assess its clinical significance.

The ability of two different lectins, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA), to combine specifically with particular carbohydrate residues was used to investigate the surface characteristics of epithelial cells of rats fed different dietary lipids from birth to 6 weeks of age. Diets contained 5% (weight) peanut oil (PO), rich in n-6 fatty acids; salmon oil (SO), rich in n-3 fatty acids; hydrogenated palm oil (HPO), deficient in both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids or a PO and rapeseed oil (RO) mixture (PRO), the control diet. Pieces of jejunal and ileal villi were excised from postweanling rats and prepared for lectin histochemical study. Concurrently, epithelial cells were removed from jejunal and ileal segments for determining their phospholipid fatty acid compositions. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency was evidenced in the HPO group by the appearance of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3n-9) in both jejunal and ileal phospholipids, which paralleled the decrease in arachidonic acid content. Accretion of 18:1n-9 and 20:3n-9 in cell phospholipids of group HPO was not sufficient to match the unsaturation level in rats fed nonhydrogenated vegetable oils (PRO, PO) or fish oil (SO). The lectin histochemical study showed that WGA strongly labelled the brush border membrane microvilli whereas binding of MAA was specific to goblet cells and mucus. Regardless of the type of diet, WGA binding was weaker in the ileum than in the jejunum. In comparison to all other groups, WGA-labelling of villi was less intense in the jejunum and disappeared almost completely in the ileum of HPO-fed rats. Although SO- and PO-fed rats had, respectively, very low and high ratios of n-6 to n-3 in their intestinal phospholipids, binding of WGA in both groups was not markedly different from that in the control (PRO). MAA-labelling was very intense in jejunal and ileal villi of n-3-fed (SO) rats, whereas it was strongly attenuated in the n-3- and n-6 deficient (HPO) group. These results suggest that intestinal glycosyltransferase activities involved in cell differentiation were altered relative to the overall unsaturation index of dietary fatty acids. Alterations of epithelial glycosylation mainly resulted from a drop in total n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, although it may be speculated that there is a specific effect of n-3 fatty acids.","PMID":7472903,"authors":[{"lastName":"Alessandri","initials":"JM","foreName":"J M"},{"lastName":"Joannic","initials":"JL","foreName":"J L"},{"lastName":"Delpal","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Durand","initials":"G","foreName":"G"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14182,"articleTitle":"Determination of atrazine, its degradation products and metolachlor in runoff water and sediments using solid-phase extraction.","dateCreated":"2008-10-30","dateRevised":"2008-10-30","publication":{"issnNumber":"0039-9140","issnType":"Print","title":"Talanta","isoAbbreviation":"Talanta"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"In order to determine the fate of the herbicides atrazine (as well as some of its degradation products) and metolachlor in water and sediments, a method was developed to extract and analyse these compounds.

The porous, coarse sand soil developed the greatest methanotrophic capacity (10.4 mol of CH(inf4) (middot) m(sup-2) (middot) day(sup-1)), the greatest yet reported in the literature. Vertical profiles of O(inf2), CH(inf4), and methanotrophic potential in the soils were determined at steady state. Methane oxidation potentials were greatest where the vertical profiles of O(inf2) and CH(inf4) overlapped. A significant increase in the organic matter content of the soil, presumably derived from methanotroph biomass, occurred where CH(inf4) oxidation was greatest. Methane oxidation kinetics showed that a soil community with a low methanotrophic capacity (V(infmax) of 258 nmol (middot) g of soil(sup-1) (middot) h(sup-1)) but relatively high affinity (k(infapp) of 1.6 (mu)M) remained in N(inf2)-purged control microcosms, even after 6 months without CH(inf4).

Kosmotropic (water structuring) anions in the Hofmeister series (HPO(4)2-, citrate3-, SO(4)2-, F-, OAc-) and glutamate stabilized the enzyme most effectively, while Cl- (a borderline Hofmeister anion) and Br- (a chaotropic anion) were destabilizing. The effects of the cations on PEPC stability ranged from relatively inert (Na+, K+) to destabilizing ((CH3)4N+, NH4+, Li+). The observed stabilization of PEPC by specific salts has been interpreted in terms of the positive surface tension increment and the water-structuring effects conferred on the solution by the specific stabilizing reagents. Both these effects enhance hydrophobic interactions of proteins and increase the energy required to enlarge the surface area of the solvent cavity in which the protein resides. The destabilization of PEPC by some salts at a concentration of 0.5 M was associated with the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme into its dimeric and monomeric forms, a process most probably occurring as a result of ion-peptide dipole binding, which promotes protein-solvent interaction and a subsequent reduction in the free energy of cavity formation. The stabilization of enzyme activity by kosmotropic salts depended on the salt concentration with maximum stabilization of PEPC in solution at 52 degrees C observed with 0.6-0.8 M sodium glutamate, 2 M KF, and 2.2 M KOAc. Higher concentrations of these salts resulted in decreased activity. This reduction in activity of PEPC in the presence of high concentrations of kosmotropic salts appears to be associated with irreversible conformational changes of the tetrameric enzyme.","PMID":7819239,"authors":[{"lastName":"Jensen","initials":"WA","foreName":"W A"},{"lastName":"Armstrong","initials":"JM","foreName":"J M"},{"lastName":"De Giorgio","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Hearn","initials":"MT","foreName":"M T"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":15427,"articleTitle":"Influence of some groundwater and surface waters constituents on the degradation of 4-chlorophenol by the fenton reaction.","dateCreated":"2012-03-28","dateRevised":"2012-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0045-6535","issnType":"Print","title":"Chemosphere","isoAbbreviation":"Chemosphere"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The Fenton reaction has been applied to the degradation of 4-chlorophenol in aqueous solutions containing various anions.

Approximately 60 minutes and 90 minutes were needed at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C, respectively, for complete saturation of the Fc binding sites with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Fc (HPO-Fc). Heat aggregated IgG (HAG) had a greater affinity for the Fc gamma R than Fc monomers. Additional binding of HAG was observed even after the binding sites were saturated with Fc monomers. This could be explained by different binding sites available only for immune complexes or by the partial dissociation of binding sites saturated with Fc by HAG. Further, we noted partial dissociation of HPO-Fc, when HAG was added after saturation of the binding sites with HPO-Fc. In a subsequent experiment, we compared the relative affinities of chemically or enzymatically modified Fc derivatives for Fc gamma R. HAG, which was used as a model for CIC, had a greater affinity for platelet Fc gamma R than IgG monomer and Fc derivatives. Pepsin-digestion of Fc caused a total loss of its affinity for the Fc gamma R, whereas b-mercaptoethanol-treated Fc fragments demonstrated substantial binding to the Fc gamma R.

Based on histological data from a previous implantation study (E. Schepers, M. De Clercq, P. Ducheyne, and R. Kempeneers, \"Bioactive glass particulate materials as a filler for bone lesions,\" J. Oral Rehab.; 18, 439-452, 1991, Ref. 1) which documented the differentiation of mesenchymal cells to cells expressing the osteoblastic phenotype in porous bioactive glass, a finite element momentum and mass transport model was constructed. In this analysis, the extracellular compositional variations and fluid flow conditions around and within porous bioactive glass granules were determined. Numerical simulations demonstrated that the interstitial fluid flow around these granules (300-360 microns) is viscosity dominated (low Reynolds number flow) and that the fluid inside the granules remains stagnant. This velocity field results in shear stresses proportional to the velocity gradient at the granule-fluid interface outside the particles and no shear stresses inside the particles. A parametric study on the effect of interstitial fluid flow on chemical species (Na+, Ca+2, HPO(4)-2) transport outside the granules revealed three domains. At low velocities (0-0.1 micron/s), the transport of species is diffusion controlled. At intermediate velocities (1.0-10 microns/s), diffusion and convection contribute to the species transport. The concentration of chemical species is nearly uniform at high velocities (100-800 microns/s). For all three cases, the transport of chemical species within the granules is diffusion controlled. The differences in transport mechanisms and interstitial fluid flow conditions lead to variations in concentrations, reaction rates, and shear stresses between the inside and the outside of the glass granules. These differences may influence cellular migration, attachment, differentiation, and the overall response to these bioactive materials.","PMID":7983093,"authors":[{"lastName":"García","initials":"AJ","foreName":"A J"},{"lastName":"Ducheyne","initials":"P","foreName":"P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":8960,"articleTitle":"Differential expression of a novel protein kinase in human B lymphocytes.

A third set of unique structures, the contractile vacuole pore(s) (CVP), is located at a nearly constant proportion of the cell circumference to the cell's right of the reference meridian. Three allelic recessive temperature-sensitive mutations, collectively named hypoangular (hpo), alter both the geometry of propagation of the reference meridian and the location of the CVPs. In mutant cells, the reference meridian typically undergoes a steady rightward shift in successive cell generations (\"cortical slippage\"); concomitantly, CVP sets come to lie closer to the reference meridian. Although CVP location is still proportional to the cell circumference, the constant of proportionality (the \"CVP angle\") is reduced. Another effect is an alteration in the widths of morphogenetic domains within the cortex. As the temperature is raised (made more restrictive), these effects are accentuated and the CVP angle becomes reduced further. At the extreme, the CVP angle collapses to zero and less, i.e., there is a topological switch such that CVPs come to lie to the left of the reference meridian, and the direction of cortical slippage reverses from rightward to leftward. These observations are hard to reconcile with existing formal models of pattern specification in this system and suggest that the hpo locus might specify a key component of the intracellular positional system.","PMID":8253268,"authors":[{"lastName":"Frankel","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Jenkins","initials":"LM","foreName":"L M"},{"lastName":"Nelsen","initials":"EM","foreName":"E M"},{"lastName":"Stoltzman","initials":"CA","foreName":"C A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13294,"articleTitle":"Dimethyl-acetamide as a cryoprotectant for rainbow trout spermatozoa.","dateCreated":"2006-05-26","dateRevised":"2006-05-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"0093-691X","issnType":"Print","title":"Theriogenology","isoAbbreviation":"Theriogenology"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Dimethyl-acetamide was evaluated as a cryoprotectant for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss ) semen on the basis of motility, percentage of dead spermatozoa as determined by fluorometry, and fertility of frozen-thawed spermatozoa.

K562 cells were pulsed with 59Fe transferrin and challenged with DFO or CP94 (100 microM IBE) for 20 or 240 min and then subjected to subcellular fractionation. At 20 min there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in both lysosomal/particulate 59Fe (75% of control) and cytosolic 59Fe ferritin (50% of control) in cells incubated with CP94, unlike cells treated with DFO where no decrease was observed. By 240 min, in addition to the above, 59Fe accumulation was significantly decreased in the nuclear, mitochondrial, and low molecular weight cytosolic fractions with CP94 (P < 0.05). With DFO a significant decrease in 59Fe in only the lysosomal/particulate and cytosolic ferritin compartments was observed at 240 min (P < 0.05). At this time, however, there was a significant accumulation of both cytosolic low molecular weight 59Fe and cytosolic DFO. The relatively rapid decrease of 59Fe within intracellular compartments seen with CP94 compared to DFO was paralleled by a significantly higher accumulation of CP94 than DFO in nuclear, lysosomal/particulate and low molecular weight cytosolic compartments at 20 min (P < 0.05). These results suggest that transferrin derived endosomal iron may be chelated by HPOs, unlike DFO, due to their faster uptake into these organelles. The more rapid access of HPOs than DFO to certain intracellular iron pools may explain the greater possibility of HPOs to inhibit proliferation of cells in vivo.","PMID":8280612,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hoyes","initials":"KP","foreName":"K P"},{"lastName":"Porter","initials":"JB","foreName":"J B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":13294,"articleTitle":"Comparison of different extenders for the cryopreservation of Atlantic salmon spermatozoa.","dateCreated":"2006-05-26","dateRevised":"2006-05-26","publication":{"issnNumber":"0093-691X","issnType":"Print","title":"Theriogenology","isoAbbreviation":"Theriogenology"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Fifteen extenders were produced by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 8, 10 or 12% of diluent volume to 5 diluents.

CP94 was highly effective at mobilizing liver iron in rats but showed toxicity at higher doses, whereas in the guinea-pig the compound lacked toxicity but was ineffective at mobilizing liver iron. These differences can be explained by the contrasting metabolism of the drug between the two species. In rats, at the top dose of 300 mg/kg intragastrically, all animals died before the end of the study, with no deaths or weight loss at lower doses. At 100 mg/kg, rat liver non-haem iron concentrations were reduced by 53% and 44% in females and males respectively (P < 0.001). At this dose, adrenal medullary cell vacuolation, increased mammary secretory activity, vacuolation of corpora luteal cells and single cell hepatocyte necrosis were seen. There were no reductions in the white cell count. At 50 mg/kg rat liver non-haem iron concentrations were decreased by 50% and 34% in females and males respectively (P < 0.02). In female rats this was associated with increased mammary secretory activity.

No reduction in liver iron was seen and no systematic dose related histological, biochemical or haematological effects were observed. Whereas in guinea-pigs 99% of urinary recovery following an oral dose of CP94 (100 mg/kg) was as the inactive glucuronide metabolite, in the rat only 23% of the dose was excreted in the urine as the glucuronide with remainder as the free drug or an iron binding metabolite. The lack of both efficacy and toxicity in the guinea-pig may therefore be explained by the rapid inactivation of CP94 by glucuronidation. This metabolism of CP94 in the guinea-pig is closer to humans than the rat, suggesting that both the efficacy and toxicity of this compound in humans may also be limited by glucuronidation.","PMID":8251385,"authors":[{"lastName":"Porter","initials":"JB","foreName":"J B"},{"lastName":"Abeysinghe","initials":"RD","foreName":"R D"},{"lastName":"Hoyes","initials":"KP","foreName":"K P"},{"lastName":"Barra","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Huehns","initials":"ER","foreName":"E R"},{"lastName":"Brooks","initials":"PN","foreName":"P N"},{"lastName":"Blackwell","initials":"MP","foreName":"M P"},{"lastName":"Araneta","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Brittenham","initials":"G","foreName":"G"},{"lastName":"Singh","initials":"S","foreName":"S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":8666,"articleTitle":"99Tcm-MDP global skeletal uptake and markers of bone metabolism in patients with bone diseases.","dateCreated":"1993-09-23","dateRevised":"2016-11-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"0143-3636","issnType":"Print","title":"Nuclear medicine communications","isoAbbreviation":"Nucl Med Commun"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"99Tcm-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) global skeletal uptake (4 h GSU) was determined by quantitative measurement of activity on bone scan images 4 h after injection in whole skeleton regions of interest (ROI) in 16 normal subjects, in five patients with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) and in 12 with Paget's disease.

The relationships between chelator concentration and inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis and ribonucleotide reductase, and phase of cell cycle arrest have also been explored. HPOs and DFO arrest the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner causing a blockade at the G1-S border after 24 h at concentrations above 30 microM iron-binding equivalents. This is associated with reduced ribonucleotide reductase activity and concomitant cessation of DNA synthesis and growth. When the chelator is subsequently removed, HPO-treated cells synchronously cascade into S phase, unlike DFO-treated cells which resume cycling in a nonsynchronous manner. Chelator concentrations of approximately 25 microM and 3 microM iron-binding equivalents inhibited growth, DNA synthesis, and ribonucleotide reductase activity by 50% in K562 and Daudi cells, respectively. Concentrations less than 10 microM iron-binding equivalents inhibited K562 cell growth without an effect on DNA synthesis but with accumulation of cells in G2 and M phases.

Inhibition of alpha-hydroxylation by IPO, HPP, and HTP was more pronounced in incubations with lung microsomes than with liver microsomes. None of the IPO analogues showed significant toxicity when given to A/J mice at a dose of 25 mumol; IPO itself was lethal at this dose. HPP and HPO, at doses of 25 mumol, significantly inhibited lung tumor multiplicity in mice treated with NNK; the other analogues and IPO itself were ineffective.

Twenty-four h urine samples were collected during the night (2300 to 0700 h) and day (0700 to 2300 h) from 11 healthy subjects (31 +/- 5 years) for two consecutive days. The concentration of HPO was measured after enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated HPO and multiple chromatographic separation steps by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The mean excretion rates of HPO were 14.8 +/- 11.8 mug/24 h with high inter-individual variations. There were no significant differences in the production of HPO during the night and day. It seemed unlikely that HPO was primarily formed in the adrenals or gonads since the excretion rates of HPO poorly correlated with the formation of 17-ketosteroids or 17-hydroxycorticosteroids that are widely used as indices of adrenal and gonadal steroid production. The data showed for the first time that HPO is produced in male subjects in concentrations similar to that of classical steroid hormones.","PMID":19215462,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hiemke","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Banger","initials":"M","foreName":"M"},{"lastName":"Knuppen","initials":"R","foreName":"R"},{"lastName":"Haupt","initials":"O","foreName":"O"},{"lastName":"Jussofie","initials":"A","foreName":"A"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":7959,"articleTitle":"Improvement in the proliferative activity of human-human hybridomas at low cell density by transfection with bFGF gene.","dateCreated":"1991-10-17","dateRevised":"2017-08-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"0920-9069","issnType":"Print","title":"Cytotechnology","isoAbbreviation":"Cytotechnology"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Highly purified recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (rbFGF) and acidic FGF (aFGF) stimulated the proliferation of human-human (h-h) hybridomas to the extent of over four-fold from a low cell density such as 1 x 10(3) cells per ml in a serum-free medium in 24-well plates.

The present study examined the relationship between anaemia and tumour response to radiation given in air or HPO in C3H mice transplanted with a mammary adenocarcinoma using a growth delay assay to assess the radiation response. Chronic anaemia was induced by the use of a low iron diet and was characterized by a significant reduction in host haematocrit and whole blood viscosity. In addition, anaemia was associated with a right shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve and an increase in the volume doubling time of the tumour; but there was no change in the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cells. Radiation studies with these anaemic mice demonstrated that the tumour radiosensitivity was decreased when treatment was given in air. HPO was successful in overcoming the increased radioresistance associated with anaemia. This result suggested that tumours grown in anaemic mice have a higher hypoxic fraction than those grown in control mice.

Anhaptoglobinemia turned out not to be present in all patients suffering from malaria, but was proportional to the parasite load and hemolysis. In patients with malaria, it was undetected after malarial prophylaxis but reappeared one month after cessation of treatment, while, in sickle cells patients, it disappeared at the end of their crisis.

Pediatric intravenous kits were used to infuse an average of 51.2 milliliters per plant. Met content of whole soybean seeds from intact plants receiving Met infusions increased by as much as 22.7%. Even greater (up to 31.0%) increases in cysteine (Cys) content were noted, indicating that soybean plants are able to metabolize Met to Cys, or that supplemental Met allows Cys accumulation by some other mechanism. Electrophoretic patterns showed a dramatic decrease in the synthesis of the beta subunit of 7S storage protein when Met was supplemented, and this effect was not confined to seeds at the lower nodes. In addition, seeds from upper compared to lower plant nodes (regardless of infusion treatment) had greater protein content (45.0 versus 41.6 w/w%), and different protein composition, as indicated by significantly different amino acid profiles. Methionine supplementation of intact soybean plants improved protein quality through an alteration in storage protein composition.","PMID":16665127,"authors":[{"lastName":"Grabau","initials":"LJ","foreName":"L J"},{"lastName":"Blevins","initials":"DG","foreName":"D G"},{"lastName":"Minor","initials":"HC","foreName":"H C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":6273,"articleTitle":"Pancreatic enzyme and plasma cholesterol response to chronic ingestion of a nonabsorbable lipid in rats.","dateCreated":"1987-03-06","dateRevised":"2016-11-23","publication":{"issnNumber":"0022-3166","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of nutrition","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Mannitol-utilizing derivatives L1-110 and L2-110 have been shown to be devoid of symbiotic nitrogen fixation ability, and non-mannitol-utilizing derivatives I-110 and S-110 have been shown to be efficient at nitrogen fixation. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of media carbon sources on the symbiotic N(2)-fixing ability of strain USDA 110 and to compare the effectiveness of strain USDA 110 and derivative I-110. Based on acetylene reduction activity and the nitrogen content of 41-day-old soybean plants, neither derivative I-110 nor cultures of USDA 110 grown in media favoring non-mannitol-using derivatives had symbiotic nitrogen fixation that was statistically superior to that of cultures of USDA 110 grown in media favoring mannitol-using derivatives. In another experiment 200 individual nodules formed by strain USDA 110 grown in yeast extract gluconate were screened for colony morphology of occupying variant(s) and acetylene reduction activity. Nodules occupied by mannitol-using derivatives (large colony type on 0.1% yeast extract-0.05% K(2)HPO(4)-0.08% MgSO(4) . 7H(2)O-0.02% NaCl-0.001% FeCl(3) . 6H(2)O [pH 6.7] with 1% mannitol [YEM] plates) had a mean acetylene reduction activity equal to that of nodules occupied by non-mannitol-using derivatives (small colony type on YEM plates). A total of 20 large colonial derivatives and 10 small colonial derivatives (I-110-like) were isolated and purified by repeated culture in YEM and YEG (same as YEM except 1% gluconate instead of 1% mannitol) media, respectively, followed by dilution in solutions containing 0.05% Tween 40. After 25 days of growth, soybean plants inoculated with the large colony isolates had mean whole-plant acetylene reduction activity, whole-plant dry weight, and whole-plant nitrogen contents equal to or better than those of plants inoculated with either the small colony isolates (I-110-like) or the I-110 (non-mannitol-using) derivative. Hence, the existence of a mannitol-utilizing derivative that fixes nitrogen in a culture of strain USDA 110 obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Md., was established. This new USDA 110 derivative was designated as MN-110 because it was a mannitol-utilizing nitrogen-fixing USDA 110 derivative. This derivative was morphologically indistinguishable from the non-nitrogen-fixing derivative L2-110 found in cultures obtained earlier from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville. DNA-DNA homology and restriction enzyme analyses indicated that MN-110 is genetically related to other USDA 110 derivatives that have been characterized previously.","PMID":16347117,"authors":[{"lastName":"Mathis","initials":"JN","foreName":"J N"},{"lastName":"Israel","initials":"DW","foreName":"D W"},{"lastName":"Barbour","initials":"WM","foreName":"W M"},{"lastName":"Jarvis","initials":"BD","foreName":"B D"},{"lastName":"Elkan","initials":"GH","foreName":"G H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":5968,"articleTitle":"The musculoskeletal manifestations of cystic fibrosis.","dateCreated":"1986-05-05","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0049-0172","issnType":"Print","title":"Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism","isoAbbreviation":"Semin.

FDNB-treated antibodies which reacted with antigen in an indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA) also yielded successful HPO-antibody conjugates. Conversely, those antibodies which did not react with antigen after treatment with FDNB failed to produce useful HPO-antibody conjugates. These data suggest that conjugation of oxidized HPO to primary amines in or near the antigen-combining site yields conjugates in which the antibody is inactive.

Sequential equilibration of red blood cells in isosmotic citrate (impermeable) followed by PO4 demonstrated the two stages of the observed shifts in PO4 alone, and red blood cells suspended in 0.15 mol/L 32PO4 at 37 degrees C showed PO4 influx consistent with pH equilibrium kinetics.

In isosmotic PO4, mean cell hemoglobin concentration was 40 to 41 gm/dl with approximately 80% sickling. In phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 70 mmol/L PO4, red blood cells showed smaller, similar changes (mean cell hemoglobin concentration approximately 38 gm/dl) with a longer equilibration period and deoxygenated sickle trait cells showed 40% sickling. The altered properties of red blood cells suspended in PO4 or phosphate-buffered saline solution were neither intended nor appropriate for many studies using these media, particularly with hemoglobin S-containing red blood cells, and interpretations of reported results must be reassessed in light of these findings.","PMID":6094692,"authors":[{"lastName":"Bookchin","initials":"RM","foreName":"R M"},{"lastName":"Lew","initials":"DJ","foreName":"D J"},{"lastName":"Balazs","initials":"T","foreName":"T"},{"lastName":"Ueda","initials":"Y","foreName":"Y"},{"lastName":"Lew","initials":"VL","foreName":"V L"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":5369,"articleTitle":"Fluoride uptake by partially-decalcified enamel: a study of possible involvement of acid phosphate ions.","dateCreated":"1984-09-13","dateRevised":"2017-02-14","publication":{"issnNumber":"0022-0345","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of dental research","isoAbbreviation":"J.

R.D.W. revealed that in the presence of (2-[4-(2',4'-dichlorophenoxy)phenoxy]propionic acid) (diclofop) the membrane potential was very sensitive to the pH of the bathing medium. At pH 5.7, 100 micromolar diclofop caused a slow reduction in the electrogenic component of the membrane potential to the value of -123 +/- 5 millivolts. Membrane resistance initially decreased, recovered transiently, then stabilized at approximately 65% of the control value. At pH 7.0, the potential appeared to plateau around -200 millivolts before rapidly declining to -140 +/- 4 millivolts; removal of diclofop resulted in recovery of the electrogenic component. Diclofop reduced cytoplasmic ATP levels by 96.4% and 36.6% at pH 5.7 and 7.0, respectively. At pH 8.2, diclofop did not change the ATP concentration significantly, but induced a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential to near -250 millivolts, and also reduced or inhibited the dark-induced hyperpolarization; the light-induced depolarization was reduced to a lesser extent. DCMU applied in the light elicited the same response at the plasmalemma as placing cells in the dark. When K(+) channels were opened and cells depolarized with 10 millimolar K(+), diclofop induced a further depolarization of approximately 30 millivolts. Cells decoupled with HPO(4) (-2) were still sensitive to diclofop. Currents associated with OH(-) efflux and HCO(3) (-) influx, as measured with a vibrating probe technique, became spatially destabilized and reduced in magnitude in the presence of diclofop. After 60 minutes, most of the cell surface was engaged in a low level of OH(-) efflux activity. The results indicate that diclofop may be a proton ionophore at pH 7.0 and 5.7. At pH 8.2, diclofop may inhibit the operation of the H(+)-ATPase and OH(-) efflux systems associated with HCO(3) (-) transport by perturbing the control processes that integrate the two, without a reduction in ATP concentration.","PMID":16663386,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lucas","initials":"WJ","foreName":"W J"},{"lastName":"Wilson","initials":"C","foreName":"C"},{"lastName":"Wright","initials":"JP","foreName":"J P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":5320,"articleTitle":"Correlation between induction of duodenal tumor by hydrogen peroxide and catalase activity in mice.","dateCreated":"1984-07-26","dateRevised":"2014-10-03","publication":{"issnNumber":"0016-450X","issnType":"Print","title":"Gan","isoAbbreviation":"Gan"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Incidences of duodenal tumor induced by oral administration of hydrogen peroxide (HPO) and catalase activities in the duodenal mucosa, blood and liver were correlated in C3H/HeN, C57BL/6N, (C57BL X C3H)F1 (B6C3F1) and hypocatalasemic C3H/Cbs mice.

Little cell death was observed; 24 hr after CCl4, 20% of the untreated animals died. In the survivors, the following typical changes occurred in the liver: extensive hepatocellular swelling, vacuolization and necrosis; severe ultrastructural alterations; binding of CCl4 to microsomal lipids; elevation of lipid peroxidation products (conjugated dienes); little decrease in cytochrome b5 and severe decrease in cytochrome P-450 levels. Serum transaminase (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) levels were elevated. Immediate treatment with HPO prevented the mortality and markedly decreased the hepatocellular necrosis 24 hr after intoxication. Immediate HPO treatment did not lower the levels of free CCl4 in the liver. However, the rise in lipid peroxidation products caused by CCl4 intoxication at 4 hr was reduced. Delayed treatment with HPO (1 hr after CCl4) prevented the mortality but was less effective in preventing necrosis. Some hepatocellular protection was still demonstrable. In particular, the rise in lipid peroxidation products was reduced. Hyperoxia protects hepatocytes against CCl4 toxicity. The rapid decline in protective effect within 60 min of intoxication suggests that hyperoxia inhibits CCl4 activation and/or damage from molecular intermediates.

The inhibition, which is dependent on free Cu(2+) as indicated by protection by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and dithiothreitol, requires illumination (electron flow) for establishment of the specific inhibition to be noted.

After a 26-h cultivation, 328.6 mg of calcium 2,5-diketo-d-gluconate per ml was obtained, with a 94.5% yield from d-glucose. This broth was used directly for the next conversion without removal of cells by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. The stereospecific reduction of calcium 2,5-diketo-d-gluconate to calcium 2-keto-l-gulonate was performed with a mutant strain of Corynebacterium sp. When the cell growth reached a maximum (about 16 h) in a medium containing d-glucose, corn steep liquor, NaNO(3), KH(2)PO(4), and trace elements, NaNO(3) was added to the culture, and then the calcium 2,5-diketo-d-gluconate broth was fed over a period of about 50 h. Since the mutant strain requires a hydrogen donor for reduction, the calcium 2,5-diketo-d-gluconate broth was mixed with d-glucose before being fed. The results of four two-stage fermentations in 10-m conventional fermentors showed that an average of 106.3 mg of calcium 2-keto-l-gulonate per ml was obtained, with a 84.6% yield from d-glucose, the starting material of calcium 2,5-diketo-d-gluconate production.

The resulting alterations in the time of puberty onset, and in other associated parameters, such as serum levels of pituitary hormones, ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins and ovarian hCG receptor content were then evaluated. CB-154 was provided in the drinking water from day 22 onward at the concentration of 20 and 100 micrograms/ml. The treatment resulted in almost complete suppression of serum PRL levels throughout the entire period studied (day 22 to first diestrus). In contrast, serum GH, FSH, and LH levels were not depressed. Likewise, pulsatile release of FSH was not affected and only a subtle alteration in pulsatile LH release was apparent. The onset of puberty, as determined by the age at vaginal opening, and at first diestrus after the first estrus and by the presence of corpora lutea at sacrifice (first diestrus), was markedly delayed in the hypoprolactinemic (HPO) rats. This inhibitory effect of CB-154 was completely prevented by concomitant administration of PRL. Ovarian weight was significantly decreased in HPO rats at the three ages studied (27, 32, and 36 days of age). By day 36, 50% of the control animals had already ovulated, as compared with only 9% of the HPO rats. Microscopic examination of ovaries from HPO rats revealed a retarded follicular development. In vitro ovarian progesterone response to hCG studied at day 32 and 36 of age was reduced in the HPO rats. Uterine growth was also depressed in HPO rats, the ovaries of which, when incubated in vitro, failed to show the prepubertal increase in estrogen response to hCG seen in control rats between day 32 ad 36. Aromatase activity, as measured by the in vitro release of estradiol from ovaries incubated in the presence of an excess of androgen substrate, was depressed in HPO rats. hCG receptor content in the ovaries from HPO rats (counts per min [125]hCG bound per micrograms DNA) was also lower than that of control animals at day 32 and 34 but not at day 36. However, at this later time the hCG receptor content per milligram of ovary was still significantly reduced in HPO rats. The results support the view that PRL plays an important role in the process of ovarian development that leads to the onset of puberty in the female rat and that this effect is, at least in part, exerted through a positive influence of PRL on ovarian LH receptor content.","PMID":6271525,"authors":[{"lastName":"Advis","initials":"JP","foreName":"J P"},{"lastName":"White","initials":"SS","foreName":"S S"},{"lastName":"Ojeda","initials":"SR","foreName":"S R"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14789,"articleTitle":"Enzymic and protein character of tonoplast from hippeastrum vacuoles.","dateCreated":"2010-06-29","dateRevised":"2010-09-14","publication":{"issnNumber":"0032-0889","issnType":"Print","title":"Plant physiology","isoAbbreviation":"Plant Physiol."},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The membrane of anthocyanin containing Hippeatrum petal vacuoles was examined for protein and enzyme content after purification by equilibrium density centrifugation.

Many tropical soils fix added bacteria tightly, resulting in low recoveries. Eight soils, representative of three of the major soil orders found in the tropics (oxisols, vertisols, and inceptisols), were tested for recovery of added Rhizobium strains. All except one Hawaiian andept (Typic Eutrandept) yielded recoveries ranging from <1 to 13%. Recovery from the andept was 100%. In soil-sand mixtures, addition of only a small amount of soil caused a dramatic decrease in recovery of added rhizobia. Increasing the soil content of the mixture from 0% (10 g of sand) to 50% (5 g of soil-5 g of sand) reduced recoveries from >90 to <1%. Varying the ionic strength and pH of the extracting solution did not cause marked increases in recovery. Protein solutions, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and NaHCO(3), on the other hand, improved release of bacteria. We report a modification to the usual membrane filter immunofluorescence procedure which yielded consistently high and reproducible recovery (coefficient of variation, 30%) of rhizobia from several tropical soils. In the modified procedure, partially hydrolyzed gelatin, diluted in ammonium phosphate, was used to suspend the soil. This caused dispersion of the soil and release of the bacteria from soil flocs. The efficiency of recovery of Rhizobium spp. from several tropical and two temperate soils remained high as the content of these soils in soil-sand mixtures was increased from 0 to 100%. The modified membrane filter immunofluorescence procedure was used to follow the growth of a strain of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) Rhizobium in a sterilized oxisol. The results showed a close agreement with viable counts at different stages during the growth cycle. Diluent for the hydrolyzed gelatin also had a marked effect on recovery. The efficiency of release of Rhizobium spp. from an oxisol was in the following order for the diluents used: 0.1 M (NH(4))(2)HPO(4) > 0.1 M Na(2)HPO(4) = 0.1 M sodium-phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) > 0.2 M NH(4)Cl > 0.2 KCl > NaCl = LiCl > water.","PMID":16345824,"authors":[{"lastName":"Kingsley","initials":"MT","foreName":"M T"},{"lastName":"Bohlool","initials":"BB","foreName":"B B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":4275,"articleTitle":"Effects of hyperbaric oxygenation on spermatozoan motility driven by mitochondrial respiration.","dateCreated":"1981-09-15","dateRevised":"2014-11-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"0161-7567","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of applied physiology: respiratory, environmental and exercise physiology","isoAbbreviation":"J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HPO) on ram sperm motility driven by mitochondrial respiration are described.

When fed to mice at levels of intake expected to produce goitre both compounds were toxic and caused severe liver damage. Thyroid enlargement was not observed in any of these feeiding experiments, but the thyroids of mice fed 0.1% TR showed moderate hyperplasia. It was concluded that both compounds are weakly goitrogenic. Hyperactivity was observed in the mice fed TR which may be associated with inhibition of catechol methyl transferase (COMT).","PMID":476852,"authors":[{"lastName":"Lee","initials":"CP","foreName":"C P"},{"lastName":"Hegarty","initials":"MP","foreName":"M P"},{"lastName":"Christie","initials":"GS","foreName":"G S"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":3401,"articleTitle":"Effect of hyperbaric oxygen on the cytotoxicity of adriamycin and nitrogen mustard in cultured Burkitt's lymphoma cells.","dateCreated":"1979-04-25","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0008-5472","issnType":"Print","title":"Cancer research","isoAbbreviation":"Cancer Res."},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HPO) exposure on the cytotoxicity of Adriamycin (ADM) and nitrogen mustard have been examined in Burkitt's lymphoma cells (P3J) in vitro.

Unsubstituted and monoalkyl monoanions (H2PO4- and CH3OPO3H-) quench the fluorescence of all investigated indole derivatives while the dimethyl anion (CH3O)2 PO2- does not. This suggests that quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by phosphate monoanions requires the presence of an acidic OH group and could be due to a proton transfer from the phosphate ion to the indole chromophore. Trianions (PO4 3-4) which are strong proton acceptors quench the fluorescence of all tryptophan derivatives except N(1)methyl tryptophan. This result strongly supports our proposal that quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by phosphate trianions occurs through deprotonation of the NH indole group. Bianions (HPO '4(7), and CH3O PO3 2-3) quench the fluorescence of several indole derivatives including N-acetyl tryptophanamide but have no effect on tryptophan or N(1)-methyl tryptophan.

PP(i) prevented much but not all of the cell detachment that accompanies decreasing the serum concentration of confluent cultures and it increased the saturation density of cultures in high serum concentrations. The stimulation had a sharp concentration dependence and was associated with the appearance in the medium of a flocculent precipitate. Stimulation and precipitate formation were dependent on Ca(2+) and inorganic orthophosphate (HPO(4) (2-)) and were inhibited by Mg(2+). More than half the Ca(2+) requirement could be met with Sr(2+). In the absence of PP(i), supranormal concentrations of either Ca(2+) or HPO(4) (2-) caused graded increases in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and total cell yield. The effect of supranormal [Ca(2+)] depended on [HPO(4) (2-)] and vice versa, and the Ca(2+) requirement could be partially met by Sr(2+). The stimulation was associated with increasing turbidity of the medium. Various other complexing agents of Ca(2+), including the divalent cation ionophore A 23187, failed to produce stimulation of 3T3 cells.

Lowering of body temperature of the animals which occurred during exposure to HPO was probably connected with manifestations of chronic toxicity. Observation of the cardiorespiratory functions suggested a possible connection between their disturbances and an onset of seizures and development of oxygen-induced paralysis.","PMID":12648,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ruszczewski","initials":"P","foreName":"P"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":2241,"articleTitle":"Electron microscopic autoradiographic and electron microscopic immunohistochemical studies on the anti-HPO antibody-producing cells.","dateCreated":"1976-02-20","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0014-4827","issnType":"Print","title":"Experimental cell research","isoAbbreviation":"Exp.

With this assay, the release of free H2O2 into the extracellular medium by phagocytizing human granulocytes has been documented and quantitated, and some of the regulating factors have been determined. Under basal conditions granulocytes released less than 0.01 nmol/ml of H2O2 (2.5 X 10-6 polymorphonuclear leukocytes/ml). Upon the addition of phagocyte particles (latex, opsonized yeast, or staphylococci), an abrupt increase in extracellular peroxide concentration was observed (greater than 50-fold above basal levels) after latencies as short as 10 s. Release reflected increased intracellular H2O2 production during phagocytosis in that it paralleled the respiratory burst and was absent when phagocytosis was prevented or when cells from patients with chronic granulomatous disease were utilized. Evidence that scpoletin oxidation occurred predominantly in the extracellular medium was obtained by demonstrating a marked inhibition when HPO was omitted from the reaction mixture or when exogenous catalase was added. Similarly, it was found that exogenous serum also inhibited scopoletin oxidation, apparently because of the presence of competing hydrogen donors. H2O2 formation and release were observed at rates which closely paralleled those of phagocytosis. With O2 consumption as an approximate index of H2O2 formation, the fractions released during maximal rates of particle uptake were calculated as follows: for latex, 15.7%; for staphylococci, 10.3%; and for yeast, 4.9%. It is postulated that release is due to diffusion of free H2O2 from an expanded intracellular pool of this substance that develops during phagocytosis. This poos represents tha net of increased synthesis versus catabolism by various enxymatic pathways for H2O2 disposal within the cells. The close relationship between rates of H2O2 formation and rates of phagocytosis by human granulocytes suggests a role for specialized areas of the cell membrane, involved in particle ingestion, in the trigger mechanism for H2O2 synthesis. The consequences of H2O2 release to other cells or organisms in the immediate environment of phagocytizing granulocytes remain to be determined.","PMID":1123431,"authors":[{"lastName":"Root","initials":"RK","foreName":"R K"},{"lastName":"Metcalf","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Oshino","initials":"N","foreName":"N"},{"lastName":"Chance","initials":"B","foreName":"B"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":1931,"articleTitle":"The immature HPO axis.","dateCreated":"1975-04-16","dateRevised":"2006-11-15","publication":{"issnNumber":"0024-7758","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of reproductive medicine","isoAbbreviation":"J Reprod Med"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"One cause or anovulation may be an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The fact that initial menstrual cycles are usually irregular and often anovulatory implies that a maturation process is taking place in the HPO axis and that cyclic ovulatory menstruation begins only when adequate maturation occurs. Moreover, the external appearance of the ovary of a severely oligomenorrheic or amenorrheic female frequently is similar to that of a prepubertal female--this is, the ovary appears normal in size of slightly smaller, has a smooth, glistening surface without convolutions, and its capsule-like outer surface reveals few, if any, underlying follicles. A reasonable assumption is that there is inadequate gonadotropin stimulation of these ovaries possibly as a result of an immature HPO axis. The studies by radioimmunoassay of FSH and LH levels in prepubertal and pubertal females offer no statistical data by which to measure the maturity of the HPO axis, although consistently low FSH and LH levels may prove meaningful. Studies of FSH and LH in patients exhibiting gonadal dysgenesis neither support or disprove the immature HPO axis theory, but studies of idiopathic sexual precocity tend to support it. Studies using LH-RF in prepubertal and pubertal females indicate a pattern of response which may give useful information in the area.","PMID":1089157,"authors":[{"lastName":"Buttram","initials":"VC","foreName":"V C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":2378,"articleTitle":"The effect of trimethadione on brain energy metabolism and EEG activity of the conscious rat exposed to HPO.","dateCreated":"1976-07-06","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0360-4012","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of neuroscience research","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Segments of proximal tubule isolated by oil blocks were perfused in vivo with one of three solutions, each containing 152 meq/liter Na(+) and 2 mmol/liter phosphate, but otherwise differing in composition. The pH of solution 1 was 6.05-6.63, indicating that 60-85% of the phosphate was in the form of H(2)PO(4) (-). The pH of solution 2 was 7.56-7.85, and 85-92% of the phosphate was in the form of HPO(4) (=). Solution 3 contained HCO(3) (-) and glucose and had a pH of 7.50-7.65. When the proximal tubules were perfused with solution 1, the (32)P concentration in the collected perfusate was found to be consistently lower than in the initial perfusion solution. In sharp contrast, when the tubules were perfused with solutions 2 or 3, (32)P concentration usually rose above that in the initial solution. Water (and persumably Na(+)) reabsorption, as measured with [(3)H]inulin, was the same with the acid and alkaline solutions. Administration of partially purified PTH clearly prevented the fall in phosphate concentration with the acid solution, but had a less discernible effect on phosphate reabsorption with the two alkaline solutions. Measurements of pH within the perfused segments with antimony microelectrodes demonstrated that PTH enhanced alkalinization of the acid perfusion solution. The findings are consistent with the view that H(2)PO(4) (-) is reabsorbed preferentially over HPO(4) (=). This can be attributed to either an active transport mechanism for H(2)PO(4) (-) or selective membrane permeability to this anion. PTH appears to either inhibit an active transport process for H(2)PO(4) (-), or to interfere with passive diffusion of phosphate by alkalinizing the tubular lumen.","PMID":4418449,"authors":[{"lastName":"Bank","initials":"N","foreName":"N"},{"lastName":"Aynedjian","initials":"HS","foreName":"H S"},{"lastName":"Weinstein","initials":"SW","foreName":"S W"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":17242,"articleTitle":"Redox state of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and phosphorylated state of adenine nucleotide in oocytes and embryos of the loach (Misgurnus fossilis L.).","dateCreated":"2017-03-17","dateRevised":"2017-08-01","publication":{"issnNumber":"0043-5546","issnType":"Print","title":"Wilhelm Roux' Archiv fur Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen","isoAbbreviation":"Wilhelm Roux Arch Entwickl Mech Org"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"The decrease of the phosphorylated state of the adenine nucleotide system (ATP)/(ADP) (HPO 4(-2) ) during oocyte maturation of the loach (Misgurnus fossilis L.) correlated with the fall of the (NAD(+))/(NADH) ratio.

Mitigation of HPO toxicity for P. aeruginosa by nutrients present at the burn site could explain the lack of in vivo success. Alternatively, HPO-induced depression of host defense mechanisms could negate beneficial effects arising from HPOs known toxicity for P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, mouse peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), preincubated for 24 h in 1 atm of air-CO(2), were used to study the in vitro effects of HPO or air-CO(2) on phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa or sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Subsequent 2-h exposures of PEC to increasing numbers of bacteria, in an air-CO(2) atmosphere, decreased the percentage of bacteria cleared as well as PEC viability. Similar exposures of PEC to bacteria in an HPO atmosphere prevented the loss of PEC viability and increased bacterial clearance. In control experiments, increasing the number of SRBC relative to PEC decreased the percentage of SRBC cleared without decreasing PEC viability, as determined under air-CO(2); short (2 h) exposure to HPO did not affect SRBC clearance. Microscopic examination of PEC indicated that a 24-h preincubation in HPO decreased the percentage of PEC which could ingest SRBC during subsequent experimental exposures (2 h) to air-CO(2) or HPO. These data suggest that short periods of exposure to HPO promote the ability of PEC to clear pseudomonads by adversely affecting the bacteria. This in turn prevents a pseudomonad-induced depression of PEC viability and function. In contrast, prolonged HPO exposure may be detrimental to phagocytic activity.","PMID":4214774,"authors":[{"lastName":"Weislow","initials":"OS","foreName":"O S"},{"lastName":"Pakman","initials":"LM","foreName":"L M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":1579,"articleTitle":"The mechanism of bicarbonate secretion in rabbit ileum exposed to choleragen.","dateCreated":"1974-04-29","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9738","issnType":"Print","title":"The Journal of clinical investigation","isoAbbreviation":"J.

In the paired control segments, mean P(CO2) increased by 4.4 torr, and was always greater than arterial P(CO2).

The results suggest that OH(-) accumulation (by addition of OH(-) or removal of H(+)) causes HCO(3) (-) secretion in cholera. This does not result from secretion of some other base (e.g., HPO(4) (-)), because HCO(3) (-) accounts for most of the base in the lumenal fluid.

Strychnine was injected intramuscularly, iontophoretically, or applied topically to the exposed brain in order to compare quantitatively its ability to prevent inhibition evoked by synaptic activation and by pharmacological means. Inhibitions were measured by the increase in membrane conductance.4. Strychnine, at concentrations just adequate to block completely the late collateral inhibition (LCI) and crossed VIII nerve inhibition, had little effect on the pharmacological inhibition caused by glycine, and sometimes there was no detectable effect at all. In one experiment even a local iontophoretic application of strychnine in a sufficient dose to diffuse over the cell and block the LCI almost completely, merely halved the effect of a small dose of glycine applied to the same localized region of the membrane.5. Higher concentrations of strychnine than those necessary to block synaptically evoked inhibition would reduce the effect of glycine but not that of GABA. The evidence indicated that any apparent effect of strychnine upon GABA could be explained by displacement of the GABA-containing iontophoretic pipette.6. The glycine-blocking action of iontophoretic pulses of strychnine was of relatively very slow onset and long duration compared to the effects of pulses of glycine and GABA.7. These findings can be interpreted as either (1) strychnine has a presynaptic action, preventing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter, in addition to its less potent post-synaptic one in blocking pharmacological inhibition, or (2) strychnine acts entirely post-synaptically, but the physiological transmitter action differs from that of glycine and GABA in being considerably more sensitive to strychnine antagonism. In either case, the use of strychnine as evidence for the claim that glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at the Mauthner cell is questionable.","PMID":4354770,"authors":[{"lastName":"Diamond","initials":"J","foreName":"J"},{"lastName":"Roper","initials":"S","foreName":"S"},{"lastName":"Yasargil","initials":"GM","foreName":"G M"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":1350,"articleTitle":"Production of a sporulation pigment by Streptomyces venezuelae.","dateCreated":"1973-09-12","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0003-6919","issnType":"Print","title":"Applied microbiology","isoAbbreviation":"Appl Microbiol"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Streptomyces venezuelae S13 produced a pH-indicating sporulation pigment on a glucose-salts-agar medium consisting of glucose, KNO(3), MgSO(4), and Na(2)HPO(4), pH 7.

The instantaneous inhibition of [(14)C]l-leucine transport by NH(4) (-) (and vice-versa) in nitrogen-starved mycelia at pH values of 7 or below can be explained by competition for a common energy-coupling system. The inhibition is not observed in carbon-starved mycelia in which the NH(4) (+) transport system is absent or inactive (but the general amino acid transport is fully active), or in iodoacetate-treated mycelia in which the NH(4) (+) transport system has been differentially inactivated. At pH values greater than 7.0, NH(3) and HPO(4) (2-) inhibit transport, presumably by discharging the membrane proton or charge gradient. Aniline counteracts the inhibitory effect of NH(3) and HPO(4) (2-) possibly by acting as a proton reservoir or buffer within the membrane.","PMID":4632394,"authors":[{"lastName":"Hunter","initials":"DR","foreName":"D R"},{"lastName":"Segel","initials":"IH","foreName":"I H"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14785,"articleTitle":"Agar medium for differential enumeration of lactic streptococci.","dateCreated":"2010-06-25","dateRevised":"2010-09-20","publication":{"issnNumber":"0003-6919","issnType":"Print","title":"Applied microbiology","isoAbbreviation":"Appl Microbiol"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"An agar medium containing arginine and calcium citrate as specific substrates, diffusible (K(2)HPO(4)) and undiffusible (CaCO(3)) buffer systems, and bromocresol purple as the pH indicator was developed to differentiate among lactic streptococci in pure and mixed cultures.

Under these conditions, HPO alone retarded growth. Trimethoprim, a non-sulfonamide which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, was not bactericidal, nor did HPO enhance existent bacteriostatic activity. The sulfonamide, sulfisozazole, was not bactericidal, but HPO enhanced bacteriostatic activity twofold; bacteriostasis was mitigated in HPO-treated and control cultures by p-aminobenzoate but not by a mixture of compounds involved in folate-mediated \"1-C\" biosynthesis. Mafenide, a unique sulfonamide, at high concentrations with HPO, was synergistically bactericidal; non-HPO-treated cultures were bacteriostatically inhibited. Bacteriostatic activity of lower mafenide concentrations was also enhanced at least twofold by HPO. These inhibitory effects of mafenide, acting with or without HPO, were mitigated by the above mixture, but not by p-aminobenzoate. This may explain the lack of in vivo HPO-mafenide enhancement in burn-wound sepsis where exudates would contain such a mixture. Lastly, HPO itself was largely bactericidal at 2.87 atm absolute of O(2). This was reversed to various degrees by the above mixture, or its components, or by folic, folinic, or p-aminobenzoic acids.

The substrate combination creatine-MgADP does not significantly protect creatine kinase against inhibition by iodoacetamide in the absence of small anions. 2. Small anions can be divided into three groups according to the way in which they affect creatine kinase: I, acetate reversibly increases enzyme activity in the forward reaction but does not affect the rate of inhibition by iodoacetamide in the presence of creatine plus MgADP; II, planar anions and some halides (HCO(3) (-), HCO(2) (-), NO(3) (-), NO(2) (-), Cl(-), Br(-), F(-)) in the presence of creatine plus MgADP protect the enzyme from inhibition by iodoacetamide; III, tetrahedral anions (SO(4) (2-), HPO(4) (2-), ClO(4) (-), BF(4) (-)) and iodide do not affect the rate of inhibition by iodoacetamide in the presence of creatine plus MgADP but may decrease the protection by class II anions under these conditions. Anions of class II and class III also reversibly inhibit enzyme activity. 3. It is concluded that class II anions form a stable and inactive quaternary enzyme-creatine-MgADP-anion complex and this is responsible for the effect attributed by previous workers to the ternary complex lacking anion. Formation of this complex, particularly in the forward reaction, can lead to markedly non-linear enzyme progress curves. Some previous observations are re-appraised in the light of these findings. 4. From the behaviour of chloride and nitrate ions, and the marked lowering of the K(i) values for creatine and MgADP they produce, it is inferred that planar or monoatomic anions act in the quaternary complex by simulating the transferable phosphoryl group in the transition state (or another intermediate state) of the reaction. 5. It is suggested that, in the course of the reaction, the tetrahedral phosphate-binding site for the transferable phosphoryl group of the substrate (that also binds class II and class III anions) changes into a trigonal bipyramid site (also occupied by class II anions). This strains the phosphoryl group to adopt the transitional sp(3)d hybridized state and must contribute significantly to the low activation energy of the reaction. 6. Catalysis is deduced to proceed by an ;in line' transfer reaction and from the effects of class II anions it is possible to estimate the approximate dimensions of the anionic site in the transition-state complex. 7. The specific protecting effect of an equilibrium mixture of substrates against inhibition by iodoacetamide provides further evidence for the conformational change suggested above as a step in the catalytic process.","PMID":5129268,"authors":[{"lastName":"Milner-White","initials":"EJ","foreName":"E J"},{"lastName":"Watts","initials":"DC","foreName":"D C"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":419,"articleTitle":"Urea-inorganic phosphate mixtures as prebiotic phosphorylating agents.","dateCreated":"1971-02-24","dateRevised":"2015-11-19","publication":{"issnNumber":"0036-8075","issnType":"Print","title":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","isoAbbreviation":"Science"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Previous attempts to phosphorylate nucleosides by heating with inorganic phosphate succeeeded only when acid phosphates such as Ca(HPO(4))(2) were used.

It was found to be a function of the external phosphate concentration. At a low concentration (up to 10(-5) mol/l) in the presence of Na(+) phosphate is quickly absorbed and hence phosphate is the limiting factor for further labelling. In the presence of K(+) phosphate uptake is constant over a long period.The enhancement of phosphate uptake by Na(+) is also found when the external concentration of P is raised up to 10(-4) mol/l. Then the gross uptake proceeds over six hours, with the greatest Na(+)-dependent increase occurring in the label of the TCA-insoluble phosphate fraction (Pu).The phosphate uptake is strongly dependent on the pH of the reaction mixture. In the presence of Na(+) it is highest between pH 5.6 and 7. As the uptake in the presence of K(+) parallels the dissociation curve of the dihydrogen form H2PO 4 (-) , the Na(+)-enhancement is optimal in the alkaline pH range (pH 8).On the basis of a comparison between the pH-dependence of phosphate uptake and the dependence of the uptake on the external phosphate concentration analysed by a method of enzyme kinetics, it is suggested that Ankistrodesmus metabolically transports H2PO 4 (-) but not HPO 4 (=) . Moreover, it is concluded from the absence of light stimulation and the weak inhibition of the uptake by DCMU or CCCP in the presence of K(+) that at low P-concentrations the diffusion is limiting the uptake. Only at higher concentrations is an active phosphate uptake measured.Furthermore it is concluded that the observed Na(+)-stimulation of the (32)P-labelling of the TCA-soluble and insoluble compounds inside the cell is indirect and depends only on the action of Na(+) and K(+) ions at the first transport site in the plasmalemma.","PMID":24496733,"authors":[{"lastName":"Ullrich-Eberius","initials":"CI","foreName":"C I"},{"lastName":"Simonis","initials":"W","foreName":"W"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":204,"articleTitle":"Equilibrium relations between the cytoplasmic adenine nucleotide system and nicotinamide-adenine nucleotide system in rat liver.","dateCreated":"1970-07-24","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0264-6021","issnType":"Print","title":"The Biochemical journal","isoAbbreviation":"Biochem.

Concentrated (1.71 n) salt solutions markedly reduced the weight and water content of centrifugally packed cells, although these cells took up considerable amounts of salts.

The observation that salts apparently penetrated the cells freely and yet caused extensive dehydration was not readily compatible with conventional concepts of solute-induced plasmolysis. Alternative hypotheses to explain the data included the following. First, the cells lost weight and water to concentrated salt solutions through a nonosmotic competitive dehydration, causing a shrinkage of the protoplasmic gel. The shrinkage of the cell wall was limited because of the rigidity of its mucopeptide layer; therefore, a space appeared between the cell wall and the cell membrane. Second, cells may have equilibrated their water activity with that of their environment by two mechanisms: (i) the loss of water by plasmolysis or competitive dehydration, and (ii) alterations in cell permeability that admitted previously excluded solutes to the cell interior. Possibly, the correct explanation of the observations reported here involves elements of all three hypotheses, plasmolysis, competitive dehydration, and permeability alterations.","PMID":4886291,"authors":[{"lastName":"Zimmerman","initials":"L","foreName":"L"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":-186,"articleTitle":"Temperature of compensation: significance for virus in- activation.","dateCreated":"1969-06-29","dateRevised":"2013-11-21","publication":{"issnNumber":"0027-8424","issnType":"Print","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","isoAbbreviation":"Proc.

T(c) has hitherto not been used in biological research. It is defined as the temperature at which a series of Arrhenius plots, related by variation of a single parameter, pass through a common point. Such systems demonstrate the so-called compensation effect and show linear variation of change in enthalpy with change in entropy; the slope [unk] H/[unk]S is T(c). Related reactions in which, for example, solvent change or structural change of the reactants does not change the mechanism of the reaction or the nature of the transition state exhibit an identical T(c). The system used in this study was a complex one, i.e., protection against thermal inactivation of Sindbis virus by HPO(4) (=) and SO(4) (=). The time-rate constant of loss of infectivity was determined at different temperatures for virus suspended in different salt concentrations at constant pH. The compensation effect was demonstrated and T(c) was found to be approximately 57 degrees C for virus inactivation in both Na(2)HPO(4) and MgSO(4) solutions. The intercept of a DeltaSdouble dagger/DeltaHdouble dagger plot, defined as the constant B, also was the same for the two salts. We suggest that determination of T(c) in biological systems might be of value in (1) establishment of whether an observed phenomenon results from the same process or mechanism as another observed phenomenon; (2) prediction of rates or other behavior under relevant conditions; and (3) classification.","PMID":5253661,"authors":[{"lastName":"Barnes","initials":"R","foreName":"R"},{"lastName":"Vogel","initials":"H","foreName":"H"},{"lastName":"Gordon","initials":"I","foreName":"I"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":14622,"articleTitle":"Determination of phosphorus and sulfur in fuel rich air-hydrogen flames.","dateCreated":"2010-01-13","dateRevised":"2010-01-13","publication":{"issnNumber":"1559-128X","issnType":"Print","title":"Applied optics","isoAbbreviation":"Appl Opt"},"articleDate":"2017-11-06","language":"eng","articleAbstract":"Excitation conditions for the green HPO bands, the uv PO bands, and the violet S(2) bands were explored.

Of 27 amino acids, only l-asparagine, l-glutamic acid, l-aspartic acid, l-glutamine, l-proline, and l-tyrosine supported growth sufficient to give a viscous supernatant solution. l-Proline and l-tyrosine, singly or combined, fulfilled the carbon, nitrogen, and energy requirements for growth and slime production. None of eight inorganic nitrogenous compounds supported growth with lactose as the carbon source. The addition of l-asparagine, l-aspartic acid, or l-glutamine to l-tyrosine or l-proline, singly or combined, did not increase growth or slime production, indicating no nutritional interactions among these amino acids. Neither lactose nor glucose was found to be required or utilized by A. viscolactis in a medium containing basal salts, l-proline, l-tyrosine, and lactose or glucose. This was established by the fact that total carbohydrate and total reducing activity remained constant during growth and slime production.","PMID":14291591,"authors":[{"lastName":"PUNCH","initials":"JD","foreName":"J D"},{"lastName":"OLSON","initials":"JC","foreName":"J C"},{"lastName":"SCALETTI","initials":"JV","foreName":"J V"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":-1614,"articleTitle":"EFFECT OF VARIOUS CONDITIONS ON ACCUMULATION OF OXYTETRACYCLINE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI.","dateCreated":"1965-08-01","dateRevised":"2016-11-22","publication":{"issnNumber":"0021-9193","issnType":"Print","title":"Journal of bacteriology","isoAbbreviation":"J.

Effect of chelating agents on the growth of Escherichia coli in seawater. J.

When this basal medium was enriched with 0.01% or less organic matter, such as casein hydrolysate, peptone, or yeast extract, growth always occurred after a short lag phase. Adding 10(-5)m cysteine or autoclaving the seawater gave a similar effect. A variety of organic chelating agents (histidine, glycine, methionine, glycylglycine, 8-hydroxyquinoline, thioglycolic acid, o-phenanthroline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, etc.) reversed the toxicity of filter-sterilized basal seawater medium in concentrations predictable from stability constants. Even metal-complexing agents such as Na(2)S(2)O(3), Na(2)S, and NaCN in appropriate concentrations reversed toxicity. The quality of the distilled water and the treatment of glassware had a significant effect on the growth of E. coli in basal seawater medium. It was concluded that iodate is probably not the toxic substance for E. coli in seawater, since relatively high concentrations were stimulatory. The inhibition resulting from the individual salts of synthetic seawater was proportional to their concentration; NaCl was most inhibitory. This toxicity is believed to be derived from trace impurities in the reagent-grade chemicals used to prepare synthetic seawater. Evidence was also found for the toxicity of heavy metals in natural seawater. Heavy metals in seawater appear to inhibit growth but not respiration.","PMID":14127563,"authors":[{"lastName":"JONES","initials":"GE","foreName":"G E"}]},{"dateCreatedEpoch":-2192,"articleTitle":"NUTRITION OF LEPTOSPIRA POMONA.

Extraction of the albumin fraction with ethanol and ether (3:1) resulted in a loss of its growth-supporting activity, which could be restored upon the addition of the extract or various fatty acids. The growth-supporting activity of fatty acids containing 2 to 18 carbon atoms was investigated with the extracted albumin medium. The activity of the fatty acid was found to be related to the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Maximal growth was obtained with palmitic, heptadecanoic, stearic, and oleic acids. The amount of growth of L. pomona increased at a fixed concentration of albumin as the molecular ratio of extracted albumin to the long-chain fatty acids increased from 1:1 to 1:6. At higher ratios, growth decreased sharply. Direct utilization of fatty acids during growth of L. pomona was shown by the incorporation of palmitic acid-1-C(14) or -2-C(14) into cellular material.

True reversal of the streptomycin injury takes place, as demonstrated by the rapid rate of recovery to the viable count of the original culture. Development of resistance has been eliminated as the cause of regrowth since the streptomycin sensitivity of recovered cultures remained the same as that of the original culture. The use of water as diluent for viability determinations potentiates the lethal effect of streptomycin activity.

Rhoads (6) showed that alumina gel C mixed with poliomyelitis virus in certain proportions at an acid pH resulted in the adsorption and inactivation of the virus. The experiments in this communication confirm Rhoads' observation, and show further that the adsorption as well as the inactivation are reversible; i.e., by changing the pH to the alkaline side with M/15 Na(2)HPO(4) it is possible to free the virus in a state in which it is again capable of producing typical poliomyelitis. These experiments show also that by this process the virus undergoes considerable purification by diminution in the concentration of non-virus-containing substances. Washing the alumina gel C-virus complex with M/5 NaCl-M/15 KH(2)PO(4) apparently dissociates no virus but is capable of freeing a certain amount of extractible organic substances. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the degree of purity and concentration of the virus by distillation in vacuo, and subsequent repeated adsorptions and elutions. By such partial purification and concentration, a virus solution with a minimal effective dose (as regards the production of typical poliomyelitis) of 0.0003 cc. was obtained. This solution had 0.04 mg. N per cc., and gave negative biuret, xanthoproteic, and ninhydrin reactions.
